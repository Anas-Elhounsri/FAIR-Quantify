        "description": "## Release notes\r\n\r\nNew feature release in the 23.2.x series.\r\n\r\nThis release wraps up a significant refactor of fMRIPrep. The main new features can be used with the ``--level`` and ``--derivatives`` flags.\r\n\r\nThe ``--level`` flag can take the arguments ``minimal``, ``resampling`` or ``full``. The default is ``full``, which should produce nearly the same results as previous versions. ``minimal`` will produce only the minimum necessary to deterministically generate the remaining derivatives. ``resampling`` will produce some additional derivatives, intended to simplify resampling with other tools.\r\n\r\nThe ``--derivatives`` flag takes arguments of the form ``name=/path/to/dir``, for example ``--derivatives anat=$SMRIPREP_DIR``.  If provided, fMRIPrep will read the specified directories for pre-computed derivatives. If a derivative is found, it will be used instead of computing it from scratch. If a derivative is not found, fMRIPrep will compute it and proceed as usual.\r\n\r\nTaken together, these features can allow a dataset provider to run a minimal fMRIPrep run, targeting many output spaces, while a user can then run a ``--derivatives`` run to generate additional derivatives in only the output spaces they need. Another use case is to provide an precomputed derivative to override the default fMRIPrep behavior, enabling easier workarounds for bugs or experimentation with alternatives.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this release includes a number of bug fixes and improvements. This release adds support for MSM-Sulc, improving the alignment of subject surfaces to the fsLR template. This process is enabled by default, but may be disabled with the ``--no-msm`` flag.\r\n\r\nThis release resolves a number of issues with fieldmaps inducing distortions during correction. Phase difference and direct fieldmaps are now masked correctly, preventing the overestimation of distortions outside the brain. Additionally, we now implement Jacobian weighting during unwarping, which corrects for compression and expansion effects on signal intensity. To disable Jacobian weighting, use ``--ignore fmap-jacobian``.\r\n\r\nFinally, a new resampling method has been added, to better account for susceptibility distortion and motion in a single shot resampling to a volumetric target space. We anticipate extending this to surface targets in the future.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* FIX: Restore --ignore sbref functionality (#3180)\r\n* FIX: Retrieve atlas ROIs at requested density (#3179)\r\n* FIX: Keep minctracc executable in FreeSurfer installation (#3175)\r\n* FIX: Exclude echo entity from optimally combined derivatives (#3166)\r\n* FIX: Disable boldref-space outputs unless requested (#3159)\r\n* FIX: Tag memory estimates in resamplers (#3150)\r\n* FIX: Final revisions for next branch (#3134)\r\n* FIX: Minor fixes to work with MSMSulc-enabled smriprep-next (#3098)\r\n* FIX: Connect EPI-to-fieldmap transform (#3099)\r\n* FIX: Use Py2-compatible version file template for fmriprep-docker (#3101)\r\n* FIX: Update connections to unwarp_wf, convert ITK transforms to text (#3077)\r\n* ENH: Allow --ignore fmap-jacobian to disable Jacobian determinant modulation during fieldmap correction (#3186)\r\n* ENH: Exclude non-steady-state volumes from confound correlation plot (#3171)\r\n* ENH: Pass FLAIR images to anatomical workflow builder to include in boilerplate (#3146)\r\n* ENH: Restore carpetplot and other final adjustments (#3131)\r\n* ENH: Restore CIFTI-2 generation (#3129)\r\n* ENH: Restore resampling to surface GIFTIs (#3126)\r\n* ENH: Restore confound generation (#3120)\r\n* ENH: Restore resampling BOLD to volumetric templates (#3121)\r\n* ENH: Restore resampling to T1w target (#3116)\r\n* ENH: Add MSMSulc (#3085)\r\n* ENH: Add reporting workflow for BOLD fit (#3082)\r\n* ENH: Generate anatomical derivatives useful for resampling (#3081)\r\n* RF: Load reportlets interfaces from nireports rather than niworkflows (#3176, #3184)\r\n* RF: Separate goodvoxels mask creation from fsLR resampling (#3170)\r\n* RF: Write out anatomical template derivatives (#3136)\r\n* RF: Update primary bold workflow to incorporate single shot resampling (#3114)\r\n* RF: Update derivative cache spec, calculate per-BOLD, reuse boldref2fmap (#3078)\r\n* RF: Split fMRIPrep into fit and derivatives workflows (#2913)\r\n* RPT: Rename CSF/WM confounds in fMRIPlot (#3172)\r\n* TST: Add smoke tests for full workflow and most branching flags (#3155)\r\n* TST: Add smoke-tests for bold_fit_wf (#3152)\r\n* DOC: Fix documentation and description for init_bold_grayords_wf (#3051)\r\n* DOC: Minor updates in outputs.rst (#3148)\r\n* STY: Apply a couple refurb suggestions (#3151)\r\n* STY: Fix flake8 warnings (#3044)\r\n* STY: Apply pyupgrade suggestions (#3043)\r\n* MNT: Restore mritotal subcommands to Dockerfile (#3149)\r\n* MNT: Update smriprep to 0.13.1 (#3153)\r\n* MNT: optimise size of PNG files (#3145)\r\n* MNT: update vendored docs script ``github_link.py`` (#3144)\r\n* MNT: Update tedana pin, test on Python 3.12 (#3141)\r\n* MNT: Bump environment (#3132)\r\n* MNT: Bump version requirements (#3107)\r\n* MNT: http:// \u2192 https:// (#3097)\r\n* MNT: Remove mritotal and dependencies from FreeSurfer ignore file (#3090)\r\n* MNT: Update environment (#3073)\r\n* MNT: Depend on newer sphinx (#3067)\r\n* MNT: Install ANTs from conda-forge (#3061)\r\n* MNT: Drop Python 3.8 and numpy 1.21 support (NEP29) (#3052)\r\n* MNT: update update_zenodo.py script (#3042)\r\n* MNT: Fix welcome message formatting and instructions (#3039)\r\n* MNT: Python 3.11 should be supported (#3038)\r\n* CI: Bump actions/setup-python from 4 to 5 (#3181)\r\n* CI: Stop testing legacy layout (#3079)\r\n* CI: Improve tag detection for docker builds (#3066)\r\n* CI: Clean up pre-release builds (#3040)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @DimitriPapadopoulos made their first contribution in https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/pull/3038\r\n* @Shotgunosine made their first contribution in https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/pull/3051\r\n* @E-Loba made their first contribution in https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/pull/3090\r\n* @smeisler made their first contribution in https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/pull/3153\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/compare/23.1.4...23.2.0",

        "description": "## Release notes\r\n\r\nNew feature release in the 23.2.x series.\r\n\r\nThis release wraps up a significant refactor of fMRIPrep. The main new features can be used with the ``--level`` and ``--derivatives`` flags.\r\n\r\nThe ``--level`` flag can take the arguments ``minimal``, ``resampling`` or ``full``. The default is ``full``, which should produce nearly the same results as previous versions. ``minimal`` will produce only the minimum necessary to deterministically generate the remaining derivatives. ``resampling`` will produce some additional derivatives, intended to simplify resampling with other tools.\r\n\r\nThe ``--derivatives`` flag takes arguments of the form ``name=/path/to/dir``, for example ``--derivatives anat=$SMRIPREP_DIR``.  If provided, fMRIPrep will read the specified directories for pre-computed derivatives. If a derivative is found, it will be used instead of computing it from scratch. If a derivative is not found, fMRIPrep will compute it and proceed as usual.\r\n\r\nTaken together, these features can allow a dataset provider to run a minimal fMRIPrep run, targeting many output spaces, while a user can then run a ``--derivatives`` run to generate additional derivatives in only the output spaces they need. Another use case is to provide an precomputed derivative to override the default fMRIPrep behavior, enabling easier workarounds for bugs or experimentation with alternatives.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this release includes a number of bug fixes and improvements. This release adds support for MSM-Sulc, improving the alignment of subject surfaces to the fsLR template. This process is enabled by default, but may be disabled with the ``--no-msm`` flag.\r\n\r\nThis release resolves a number of issues with fieldmaps inducing distortions during correction. Phase difference and direct fieldmaps are now masked correctly, preventing the overestimation of distortions outside the brain. Additionally, we now implement Jacobian weighting during unwarping, which corrects for compression and expansion effects on signal intensity.\r\n\r\nFinally, a new resampling method has been added, to better account for susceptibility distortion and motion in a single shot resampling to a volumetric target space. We anticipate extending this to surface targets in the future.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* FIX: Final revisions for next branch (#3134)\r\n* FIX: Minor fixes to work with MSMSulc-enabled smriprep-next (#3098)\r\n* FIX: Connect EPI-to-fieldmap transform (#3099)\r\n* FIX: Use Py2-compatible version file template for fmriprep-docker (#3101)\r\n* FIX: Update connections to unwarp_wf, convert ITK transforms to text (#3077)\r\n* ENH: Restore carpetplot and other final adjustments (#3131)\r\n* ENH: Restore CIFTI-2 generation (#3129)\r\n* ENH: Restore resampling to surface GIFTIs (#3126)\r\n* ENH: Restore confound generation (#3120)\r\n* ENH: Restore resampling BOLD to volumetric templates (#3121)\r\n* ENH: Restore resampling to T1w target (#3116)\r\n* ENH: Add MSMSulc (#3085)\r\n* ENH: Add reporting workflow for BOLD fit (#3082)\r\n* ENH: Generate anatomical derivatives useful for resampling (#3081)\r\n* RF: Write out anatomical template derivatives (#3136)\r\n* RF: Update primary bold workflow to incorporate single shot resampling (#3114)\r\n* RF: Update derivative cache spec, calculate per-BOLD, reuse boldref2fmap (#3078)\r\n* RF: Split fMRIPrep into fit and derivatives workflows (#2913)\r\n* DOC: Fix documentation and description for init_bold_grayords_wf (#3051)\r\n* STY: Fix flake8 warnings (#3044)\r\n* STY: Apply pyupgrade suggestions (#3043)\r\n* MNT: Bump environment (#3132)\r\n* MNT: Bump version requirements (#3107)\r\n* MNT: http:// \u2192 https:// (#3097)\r\n* MNT: Remove mritotal and dependencies from FreeSurfer ignore file (#3090)\r\n* MNT: Update environment (#3073)\r\n* MNT: Depend on newer sphinx (#3067)\r\n* MNT: Install ANTs from conda-forge (#3061)\r\n* MNT: Drop Python 3.8 and numpy 1.21 support (NEP29) (#3052)\r\n* MNT: update update_zenodo.py script (#3042)\r\n* MNT: Fix welcome message formatting and instructions (#3039)\r\n* MNT: Python 3.11 should be supported (#3038)\r\n* CI: Stop testing legacy layout (#3079)\r\n* CI: Improve tag detection for docker builds (#3066)\r\n* CI: Clean up pre-release builds (#3040)",

        "description": "## Release Notes\r\n\r\nNew feature release in the 23.0.x series.\r\n\r\nThis release adds improvements for workflows targeting the fsLR grayordinate space. Namely, morphometric (curvature, sulcal depth and cortical thickness) measures are output as ``.dscalar.nii`` files and high-variance voxels can be excluded from the resampling step using ``--project-goodvoxels``.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, T2w images are now resampled to the T1w-defined subject space if FreeSurfer reconstruction is used. If multiple T2w images are provided, they are merged into a single image first.\r\n\r\nPEPolar fieldmaps with R/L phase-encoding directions or in non-standard orientations are now better supported. We continue to work toward better support for more SDC configurations.\r\n\r\n23.0.0 supports FreeSurfer 7.3.2, which is now bundled in the Docker image.\r\n\r\nICA-AROMA support will be removed in 23.1.0.\r\n\r\nWith thanks to Thomas Madison, Greg Conan, Celine Provins, Robert Smith and Yaroslav Halchenko for contributions.\r\nThanks also to Steve Giavasis and colleagues at the Child Mind Institute for feedback on SDC processing.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* FIX: Pass reference image to unwarp_wf, use reference fieldwarp for single shot (#2945)\r\n* FIX: Pass fmap filters to sdcflows (#2932)\r\n* ENH: Resample morphometrics to fsLR dscalar CIFTI-2 files if ``--cifti-output`` is used (#2959)\r\n* ENH: Add option to exclude projecting high variance voxels to surface (update of #2855) (#2956)\r\n* ENH: Separate deep from shallow WM+CSF in the carpetplot (#2744)\r\n* ENH: Merge T2w images and coregister to T1w template (#2941)\r\n* RF: Use DataFrame.rename instead of ad hoc process (#2937)\r\n* DOC: Update the description of the carpetplot in the sample report (#2950)\r\n* DOC: Altered CLI option grouping (#2944)\r\n* DOC: Update lesion ROI documentation, warn in docs and app about upcoming changes (#2943)\r\n* DOC: Update docs following read-through (#2930)\r\n* DOC: Update carpetplot in \"Outputs of fMRIPrep\" (#2923)\r\n* MNT: Codespell config, action + some typo fixups (#2958)\r\n* MNT: Warn that AROMA support will be removed in a future version (#2940)\r\n* MNT: Update Ubuntu, FreeSurfer, AFNI and Convert3D (#2931)\r\n* MNT: Switch to hatch build backend and update package metadata (#2914 + #2939)\r\n* MNT: Rotate CircleCI secrets and setup up org-level context (#2928)\r\n* CI: Minor updates to CircleCI config to improve resilience (#2957)\r\n* CI: Weekly docker build from scratch (#2938)\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Lestropie made their first contribution in https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/pull/2944\r\n* @madisoth made their first contribution in https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/pull/2956\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/compare/22.1.1...23.0.0",

If you have been seeing issues with SDC in 21.0.x or 22.0.x, please test out this version and submit issues.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this version includes improvements to structural preprocessing, generating morphometric ``.shape.gii`` files from FreeSurfer derivatives.\r\n\r\nFinally, this release introduces a method for estimating the carbon footprint of using fMRIPrep. Add ``--track-carbon`` to your command to try this out. Note that it does not work in Docker containers, but should work for Singularity containers.\r\n\r\nWith thanks to Nikhil Bhagwat for contributions.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n  * FIX: Conform --reports-only to match post-run report generation (#2900)\r\n  * FIX: Remove cortex masking during vol2surf sampling (#2879)\r\n  * FIX: Do not attempt to calculate TA if SliceTiming is degenerate (#2901)\r\n  * FIX: Pass CrownCompCor components to GatherConfounds (#2897)\r\n  * FIX: Output brain mask and boldref in BOLD space if individual echos requested (#2852)\r\n  * FIX: Check for empty ACompCor results before trying to rename (#2851)\r\n  * FIX: Filter sbrefs by BIDS filters if available (#2843)\r\n  * ENH: Provide free memory estimate to unwarp_wf for better resources allocation (#2910)\r\n  * ENH: Add migas telemetry in addition to sentry (#2817)\r\n  * ENH: Tag memory based on data shape, annotate T2SMap (#2898)\r\n  * ENH: Add of carbon tracker to estimate workflow emissions (#2834)\r\n  * ENH: Output BOLD HMC transforms and reference volume (#2860)\r\n  * RF: CIFTI generation (#2884)\r\n  * DOC: Correct description of --longitudinal behavior (#2905)\r\n  * MNT: Update fast track outputs, use latest smriprep (#2894)\r\n  * MNT: Deprecate ``--topup-max-vols`` (#2881)\r\n  * MNT: Add a ``--debug pdb`` to allow easier line-by-line debugging (#2871)\r\n  * MNT: Generate more verbose reports (here, showing fieldmaps) if running in debug mode (#2872)\r\n  * DOCKER: Build wheel and install in two-stage build (#2859)\r\n  * CI: Various updates (#2899)\r\n  * CI: Test on Python 3.10, bump actions versions (#2895)\r\n  * CI: Fix non-fasttrack outputs for maint/21.0.x (#2866)\r\n\r\n[SDCFlows 2.2.0]: https://github.com/nipreps/sdcflows/releases/2.2.0\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @nikhil153 made their first contribution in https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/pull/2834\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/compare/22.0.2...22.1.0",

        "description": "## Release Notes\r\n\r\nBug-fix release in the 21.0.x series.\r\n\r\nThis release re-enables reverse-PE EPI fieldmaps, i.e. EPIs acquired with the opposite phase-encoding direction to a BOLD series.\r\nAdditionally, the ``--use-syn-sdc`` option will now error by default if no ``PhaseEncodingDirection`` can be found for a BOLD series. To reduce this to a warning, use ``--use-syn-sdc warn``. SyN-SDC will NOT be run, but the workflow will proceed.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\n>  ``topup`` runtime scales with the number of volumes used, so fMRIPrep defaults to using a maximum of 5 volumes from each of the BOLD series and the EPI fieldmap. To adjust this, please use the ``--topup-max-vols`` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* FIX: Create single fmap_select_std node for use with all ANAT estimators (#2692)\r\n* FIX: Re-enable reverse-PE EPI fieldmaps (#2684)\r\n* FIX: Pass boolean use_syn_sdc to find_estimators (#2685)\r\n* FIX: Ensure AROMA inputs are uncompressed if --low-mem (#2657)\r\n* ENH: Add ``--topup-max-vols`` flag to control TOPUP runtime (#2688)\r\n* ENH: Allow ``--use-syn-sdc`` to take a \"warn\" option to avoid exiting when PE dir is unavailable (#2680)\r\n* RF: Add extension field to differentiate from upcoming templates (#2613)\r\n* WRAPPER: Map ``--bids-filter-file``\\s into Docker container (#2691)\r\n* MNT: Silence warning from pybids; list packaging as dependency (#2689)\r\n* MNT: Add netbase to Docker image to ensure correct datalad operation (#2682)\r\n* MNT: Restore nitime to requirements, necessary for DVARS (#2678)\r\n",
