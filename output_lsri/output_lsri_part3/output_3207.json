Apache Spark achieves high performance\n    for both batch and streaming data, using a state-of-the-art DAG\n    scheduler, a query optimizer, and a physical execution engine.\n*   DeepVariant (v0.7) hasn't supported multiple GPUs. Through\n    DeepVariant-on-Spark, all of GPU resources can be fully utilized across multiple nodes.\n    For example, nVidia DGX-1 has 8 Tesla V100.\n*   DeepVariant-on-Spark leverages Atgenomix SeqPiper, a wrapper technology using Spark PipeRDD,\n    to parallelize DeepVariant pipeline on Spark and to use Yarn to optimize resource\n    allocation in multi-node environment.\n \n"
