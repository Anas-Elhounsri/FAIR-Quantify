        "value": "**scGate** is an R package that automatizes the typical manual marker-based approach to cell type annotation, to enable accurate and intuitive purification of a cell population of interest from a complex scRNA-seq dataset, **without requiring reference gene expression profiles or training data**. **scGate** works with any scRNA-seq technology and with other single-cell modalities. \n**scGate** builds upon [UCell](https://github.com/carmonalab/UCell) for robust single-cell signature scoring and [Seurat](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/), a comprehensive and powerful framework for single-cell omics analysis. \nBriefly, **scGate** takes as input: *i)* a gene expression matrix stored in a Seurat object and *ii)* a \u201cgating model\u201d (GM), consisting of a set of marker genes that define the cell population of interest. The GM can be as simple as a single marker gene, or a combination of positive and negative markers. More complex GMs can be constructed in a hierarchical fashion, akin to gating strategies employed in flow cytometry.  \n**scGate** evaluates the strength of signature marker expression in each cell using the rank-based method UCell, and then performs k-nearest neighbor (kNN) smoothing by calculating the mean UCell score across neighboring cells. kNN-smoothing aims at compensating for the large degree of sparsity in scRNA-seq data. Finally, a universal threshold over kNN-smoothed signature scores is applied in binary decision trees generated from the user-provided gating model, to annotate cells as either \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cimpure\u201d, with respect to the cell population of interest. \n"
