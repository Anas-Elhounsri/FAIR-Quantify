Ideally, the network should contain three different types of nodes\nrepresenting drugs, proteins, and indications/phenotypes. The hypothesis underlying this software is that by reasoning\nover a multitude of possible paths between a given drug and indication, the drug regulates the indication in the\ndirection of the signs of the most frequently occurring paths (i.e., majority rule). In other words, we assume that a\ndrug has a greater likelihood of interacting with its target, and its target with intermediate nodes, to modulate a\npathological phenotype as the number of possible paths connecting a drug to the phenotype increases. Based on this\nhypothesis, this software can be applied for different applications outlined in the next section.\n \n"
