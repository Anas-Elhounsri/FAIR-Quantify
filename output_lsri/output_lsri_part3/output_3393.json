You can also decide whether to continue in silent mode, which will repress the intermediate pre-processing steps (default). Furthermore, you can decide if you want to analyse a single image or multiple images, which you have to select afterwards. Fiji will start pre-processing and you have to select the region of interset (ROI) for all images and click 'OK'. If you turned of the silent mode, select the ROI from the top image (*MAX_ \\* _.tif*). The pre-processed image and the mask with the selected ROI will be saved in the output folder (as '\\*\\_filter.tif' and '\\*\\_mask.tif', respectively, see Output).\n \n*Gauging:* \n   The GUI will prompt you to select an image for parameter gauging if you analyze multiple images. If you chose to analyze a single image, this image will be used for gauging. In the gauging step, the optimal parameters for the segmentation of the cytoskeleton are determined by opening the gauging window. Press \"Open Image\" to see your selected image. Drag the parameter sliders (v<sub>width</sub>, v<sub>thres</sub>, v<sub>size</sub>, v<sub>int</sub>) to see the segmentation results (that might take some seconds). If you are satisfied with the segmentation, press \"Choose Parameters\" and your chosen parameters will be saved for the extraction process. Click \"Back to Main Menu\" to continue. Open another image with the \"Open Image\" button, which will immediately show the extracted skeleton using the last chosen set of parameters.\n   \n    \n*Extraction:* \n   The extraction is done in Python 3. The pre-processed image and the mask will be used to extract a network from the cytoskeleton of every slice in the image. Additionally, for every extracted network a user-defined number of random network will be generated (default=1). The extracted and random networks and their node positions will be saved in the output folder, as well as a plot of the first image slice and the overlayed extracted network (colored according to the edge capacity). Calculated  network properties are saved in tables for both extracted and random networks.\n     \n"

You can find the Python 3 path by typing \"which python3\" in your terminal (Mac OS, Linux). If you use Windows search for python.exe with the Search button and open and copy the file location. Press \"OK\" to continue. Your Python 3 path will be saved for future sessions. You can change it by selecting \"Reset Python3 path\" in the CytoSeg2.0 main menu. After you input the Python path, the plugin will check if all necessary Fiji plugins and Python modules are installed.\n"
