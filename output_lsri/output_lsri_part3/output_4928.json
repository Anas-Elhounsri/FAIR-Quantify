Do not import any package. Then, load one of the scenes in the Assets folder by double clicking it.  \nThe following parameters are editable by clicking the object name on the object browser in unity (other parameters should not be changed to avoid unwanted behavior): \n* On the SimulationManager object: \n  * Length of the experiment in seconds\n  * Diffusion speed of membranal proteins (both receptors and ligands)\n  * Binding probability of receptor-ligand pairs\n  * Unbinding probability of receptor-ligand complex\n  * Signal generation probability of receptor ligand complex\n  * Binding distance\n  * Interaction radius\n  * Endocytosis rate (probability of endocytosing per receptor per second)\n* On each Cell (referred to as cell1Delta and cell2Notch) object:\n  * Random seed for receptor movement\n  * Exocytosis rate (number of membranal proteins per second)\n  * Percent of receptors to show \u2013 note that this depends heavily on the strength of hardware available. Lower value if the simulation stutters.\n  \nFor the Filopodia model, the following parameters may be edited on the filopodial cell:\n* Exocytosis mainly in filopodia \u2013 toggle to enable this option.\n* Ratio of exocytosing receptors in filopodia \u2013 the percent of receptors to exocytose in the filopodium.  \n"
