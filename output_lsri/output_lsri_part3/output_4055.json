Visualize the channels as necessary for visual inspection by controlling which are visible with the \"Displayed Channel\" panel.\n5. Select the color channel that is meant to be processed in the \"Input Channel\" panel.\n6. Click on Segment image.\n7. The image will be displayed with a green outline and white skeleton by default (color can be changed in \"Image\" menu).\n8. Inspect the image as necessary and change parameter if needed, including the grey threshold (pixel level above background) or the parameters that are accessed by clicking on the gear button.\n9. To compare the segmentation to the original image, select the \"Displayed Channels\" and \"Secondary Binary\" image to inspect, and then hit spacebar to quickly toggle between them.\n10. Manually add to the segmentation (what is considered vessel, surrounded by green border) by left clicking and dragging. Right click and dragging will remove pixels from segmentation. Adjust the cursor edit size as necessary.\n11. When done click \"Save Data\".\n12. Move onto the next image, or auto process all images at once in the folder by going to \"Data >> Process All Images\".\n13. When finished, the output metrics are quantified by running \"Data >> Quantify All Images\". Output metrics for each image are saved CSV file in the same folder where the images are found.\n14. To export the binary segmentation images, go to \"Data >> Export Binary of All Images\", the image segmentation (black and white of what is vasculature) will be saved in a subfolder 'bw' found within the currnet image folder. These images can be used to evaluate cellular colocalization with the vasculature. \n"

(*units*: mm/mm^2).\n4. **branchpoint_count**: number of branchpoints in vessel network (calcualted from branchpoints of vessel centerline). This is used as a metric of vessel density that looks at the complexity of the network. If compared across image settings, should be normalized to image field of view with consistent image volume (*units*: none, count).\n5. **segment_count**: number of segments in vascular network, calculated from the vessel centerline (specically all line segments of centerline between two branchpoints or a branchpoint and the end of the image). Used to look at complexity of network very similiar to branchpoint count (but not used as often). Just like with branchpoint count, should be normalized to image field of view with consistent image volume (*units*: none, count).\n6. **mean_segment_length_um**: Average physical length of segments that is used to calculate the branchpoint count. Another measure of complexity of the vascular network, with higher complexity networks having smaller values (*units*: micrometers).\n7. **mean_tortuosity**: how tortuose blood vessel segments are. Calculates score for each segment and then computes the mean for each image. High value means more tortuous, where the vessel take a longer path to reach its endpoint compared to traveling in a straight line between endpoints (*units*: none, distance/distance).\n8. **mean_valency**: measure of complexity of a vessel network (higher is more complex). Calculated with the ratio of branchpoint_count to segment_count (*units*: none, ratio of counts).\n9. **mean_segment_diam_um**: measures the mean diameter (thickness) of vessels. Calculates diameter for each vessel and then computes mean (*units*: um).\n10. **max_diffusion_dist_um** (not ready for use in publication): measures how effective oxygen coverage is for a tissue by examining on average how far away tissue is from a blood vessel. Higher values mean less oxygen delivered to surroudning tissue (*units*: micrometers).\n \n"
