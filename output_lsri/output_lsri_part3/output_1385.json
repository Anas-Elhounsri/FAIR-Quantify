Nightingale Health: IF there is a metabolite ID that metaboprep can not automatically annotate, because the spelling has changed it would be best to identify this change and edit the spelling manually before running metaboprep. \n3. Nightingale Health: IF there is a metabolite ID that metaboprep can not automatically annotate, because it is a new feature, then you can still run metaboprep BUT if that feature is a derived feature - like a ratio - and you want to exclude ratios from some of the QC steps such as when identifying independent features or estimating PCs, then metaboprep will - at present - not be able to exclude this feature. We are aware of this issue and are looking for a fix. \n4. Metabolon has a new data release format. We are working to incorporate it into the package. At present you will just have to extract the metabolite, sample annotation, and feature annotation files as flat text files, and run them as such. \n"

Make sure that R is in your environment - an often necessary step if working on an HPC.\n\t1. for example: module add languages/R-3.5-ATLAS-gcc-7.1.0\n4. Run the metaboprep pipeline on a terminal command line as follows:\n\t\n\t```R\t\n\tRscript run_metaboprep_pipeline.R /FULL/PATH/TO/example_data/excel/parameter_file.txt\n\t```\n\t\n5. If you experienced issues with the geneartion of the html report on an HPC, the report can be generated on a local machine as follows.\n\t1. move to your newly generated metaboprep project directory. \n\t\t* it will take the form of \"../metaboprep_release_TODAYSDATE/\"\n\t2. You should find an R data object called \"ReportData.Rdata\". Save a copy locally.\n\t3. Open an R session\n\t4. produce report with the function metaboprep::generate_report() as\n\t\t\n\t\t```R\n\t\toutput_dir_path = paste0(\"FULL/PATH/TO/DIR/OF/CHOICE/\")\n\t\trdfile = paste0(output_dir_path, \"ReportData.Rdata\")\n\t\tgenerate_report( full_path_2_Rdatafile = rdfile, dir_4_report = output_dir_path )\n\n\t\t```\n"

There is a (1) metabolon like (v1 format) excel file of the data set, and a (2) flat text (tab delim) version of the data set. Both are accompanied by a parameter file to help guide you with the example. This example data includes data from two hypothetical mass spectrometry run modes or platforms, \"neg\" and \"pos\". As such, a subset of the metabolites were run (simulated) in the \"neg\" run mode in two batches, and the second subset of metabolites were run (simulated) in the \"pos\" run mode in three batches. Each batch was simulated with different mean abundance values to help illustrate possible batch effects and the normalization procedure. If looking at the flat text version of the example, information on which metabolites were simulated in which run mode or platform can be found in the flat text file \"feature_data.txt\" in the column \"platform\". Further, to identify which samples belonged to which batch, for each run mode, you would use the columns \"neg\" and \"pos\" in the flat text file \"sample_data.txt\".\n"
