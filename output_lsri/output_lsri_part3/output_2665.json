I have not tested it on the new Arm chip macs, only intel.\n* Linux (Ubuntu, dynamic linking)\n  * This should work on Ubuntu-like systems (e.g., Debian and possible others).\n  * It does have some dynamically linked C/C++ libraries, so it may not work if you have an older system.  See the release page for more info.\n* Linux (Alpine, static linking)\n  * This *should* work on most Linux systems.\n  * It is statically linked, so it should *Just Work* :)\n  * If you are on Linux, this is the one you probably want.\n\nYou can find them all on the [releases](https://github.com/mooreryan/pasv/releases) page.\n\nDon't forget that after downloading one of the binaries, you will need to adjust the permissions to make it executable.\nAdditionally, you will need to install the [external dependencies](./installing-external-dependencies.md) that PASV relies on.\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example of getting one of the `pasv` binaries working:\n\n```\n$ wget https://github.com/mooreryan/pasv/releases/download/2.0.2/pasv-2.0.2-alpine-static.zip\n$ unzip pasv-2.0.2-alpine-static.zip\n$ chmod 755 pasv\n$ ./pasv --help\n```\n\nNote that it is for `pasv` version 2.0.2 and using the `alpine-static` version.

WSL may work, but I don't have a way to support it right now.*\n\n*Note: If you use Docker, you won't have to install the [external dependencies](./installing-external-dependencies.md) that PASV relies on.  (Other than Docker of course!)*\n\nAn easy way to get started with PASV is by using the [Docker image](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_docker_images/pkgs/container/pasv) we have created.\n\n## Install Docker\n\nFirst, you will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your computer.\n\n## Run pasv in Docker\n\nNow you can run `pasv` inside of the Docker container.  You can run Docker directly, or use one of the [helper scripts](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_docker_images/tree/main/pasv/pasv/scripts) that I made.\n\n### Using Docker directly\n\nYou can get the main help screen like this.\n\n```\n$ docker run \\\n    --rm \\\n    -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \\\n    -w $(pwd) \\\n    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \\\n    ghcr.io/mooreryan/pasv:VERSION \\\n    --help\n```\n\n*Note: just replace VERSION above with the actual Docker image version, e.g., 2.0.2-7d7713a.*\n\n### Using helper scripts\n\nThat's a lot to remember to type, so I recommend using one of the [helper scripts](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_docker_images/tree/main/pasv/pasv/scripts).\n\nTo \"install\" the scripts, just download them and put them somewhere on your `PATH`.\n\nHere's how you get the main help screen.  It does the same thing as above.\n\n```\n$ pasv_docker --help\n```\n\nWhen you use the script, you can just replace `pasv` with `pasv_docker` and you should be good.\n\n### Docker gotchas\n\nThere are some things to watch out for with Docker.  Note that if you use the [helper scripts](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_docker_images/tree/main/pasv/pasv/scripts) rather than running the Docker CLI manually, these will be taken care of for you.\n\n* Sometimes you need to provide the full path to a file.\n* You need to make sure to mount a volume so the Docker container can read and write files on your hard disk.\n* You probably want to set the working directory of the container to your current working directory (unless you want to specify absolute paths to everything).\n* You probably want to explicitly set the user and group IDs.  If you don't everything Docker creates will be owned by a different user.  (At least that's how it works on Linux.)\n\n#### sudo\n\nOn Linux, you need to run Docker with `sudo`.\n\n```\n$ sudo pasv_docker ...\n```\n\nIf you do that, the output directories and files will be owned by `root`.\n\nTo get around this, you should use the `sudo_pasv_docker` script.  It uses sudo from inside the script in such a way that the output files and directories will be owned by the current user and group rather than the root user and group.\n\n*Note: I'm not sure if the same issues exist on MacOS or Windows :/*\n"
