        "value": "The R package provides functions based on knockoff inference to identify motifs from binary types of molecular sequences stored in a fasta file, such as the assembled contigs from metagenomic data. \n\nFor each query sequence, KIMI first counts  the number of occurrences of all k-mers by a c++ program using a hash table. The kmer counts are then normalized into frequencies. For each particular kmer, \nthe kmer frequency vector of all sequences are further normalized with mean 0 and standard diviation 1. Then the WMW test is applied for testing the significance of each kmer being relevant, and\nthe kmer that is least likely to be relevant is dropped. We then apply knockoff inference for selecting relevant kmers [1]. \n"
