CAMITAX determines the interval-union LCA (iuLCA) of gene-level assignments and places *G* on the lowest taxonomic node with at least 50% coverage.\n**(D) Phylogenetic placement.**\nCAMITAX uses Pplacer to place *G* onto a fixed reference tree, as implemented in CheckM, and estimates genome completeness and contamination using lineage-specific marker genes.\n**(E) Classification algorithm.**\nCAMITAX considers the lowest consistent assignment as the longest unambiguous root-to-node path in the taxonomic tree spanned by the five taxIDs derived in (A)\u2013(D), i.e. it retains the most specific, yet consistent taxonomic label among all tools.\n \n"
