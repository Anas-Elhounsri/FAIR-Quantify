We propose a method to apply the machine learning concept of transfer learning to unsupervised clustering problems and show its effectiveness in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). The goal of scRNA-Seq experiments is often the definition and cataloguing of cell types from the transcriptional output of individual cells. To improve the clustering of small disease- or tissue-specific datasets, for which the identification of rare cell types is often problematic, we propose a transfer learning method to utilize large and well-annotated reference datasets, such as those produced by the Human Cell Atlas. Our approach modifies the dataset of interest while incorporating key information from the larger reference dataset via Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The modified dataset is subsequently provided to a clustering algorithm. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our approach on simulated scRNA-Seq data as well as on publicly available datasets. Finally, we present results for the analysis of a recently published small dataset and find improved clustering when transferring knowledge from a large reference dataset. \n \n"

Ie. we want\n to turn off the cell- and gene-filter as well as the log transformation.\n You can provide source labels to be used as a starting point for NMF. If not those labels\n will be generated via NMF Clustering.\nPotential problems:\n* If a ''Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx.so or libmkl_def.so.''\noccurs and Anaconda open data science platform is used, then use _conda install mkl_ first.\n* Depending on the data and cluster range, this step can take time. However, you can\n speed up the process by tuning off the t-SNE plots using the _--no-tsne_ command \n (see [Wiki](https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA/wiki) for further information)\n\n![Cluster the source data](doc/screen_install_source.png)\n\n\nThis will result in a number of files:\n* t-SNE plots (.png) for every number of cluster as specified in the --cluster-range argument (default 6,7,8)\n* Output source model in .npz format for every number of cluster as specified in the --cluster-range argument (default 6,7,8)\n* A summarizing .png figure\n* True cluster labels - either as provided from user or as generated via NMF Clustering - (and corresponding cell id) in .tsv format for every number of cluster as specified in the --cluster-range argument (default 6,7,8)\n* Model cluster labels after NMF (and corresponding cell id) in .tsv format for every number of cluster as specified in the --cluster-range argument (default 6,7,8)\n\n\n\n\n**Step 5**: Now, it is time to cluster the target data and transfer knowledge from the source model to our target data. Therefore, we need to\nchoose a source data model which was generated in **Step 4**. In this example, we will \npick the model with 8 cluster (*src_c8.npz*).\n\n* Depending on the data, the cluster range and the mixture range, this step can take a long\ntime. However, you can  speed up the process by tuning off the t-SNE plots using the _--no-tsne_ command \n(see [Wiki](https://github.com/nicococo/scRNA/wiki) for further information)\n\n![Cluster the target data](doc/screen_install_target.png)\n\nWhich results in a number of files (for each value in the cluster range).\n* Predicted cluster labels after transfer learning (and corresponding cell id) in .tsv format for every number of cluster as specified in the --cluster-range argument (default 6,7,8)\n* t-SNE plots with predicted labels (.png)\n* Data and gene ids in .tsv files\n\nIn addition there is a summarizing .png figure of all accs and a t-SNE plot with the real target labels, if they were provided.\n\n![Cluster the target data](doc/screen_install_result.png)\n\nCommand line output shows a number of results: unsupervised and supervised (if no ground truth labels \nare given this will remain 0.) accuracy measures.\n"
