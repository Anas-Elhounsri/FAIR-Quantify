For example, every class has a structure that looks like\n````\n####\n# <class name>\n####\n````\n \nAlso, while R assumes that all variables are global, Ref-Classes allow some amount of encapsulation.  In order to hide \"private\" functions, I often define functions inside the function that uses it.  While this often appears to be no gain in terms of readability, I have found that it becomes very readable when I collapse the inside function during viewing or debugging. \nBelow I describe some of the primary features of this current release, from a programmer's point of view.\n \n"

The Data_Processor uses the `append_child()` directly to make a parent aware of child.  It also uses `append_parent()` (indirectly) to complete the bidirection association, through the use of functions named (for example) `set_info()` and `set_raw_data()`. \nThe rules for Data_Object are described in test.R under the definition of the Test_Data_Object class (I used Test-Driven Development for this piece). The key features are that you can use `load_data()` to force an object to load or `ensure()` to load data if and only if it is needed; this is a Just In Time feature. Furthermore, `load_data()` calls `ensure()` on all parents.  Thus, you need only call ensure on the object of interest, not on all of the objects on which it depends. Also, calling `ensure()` multiple times in a row only performs a single load so it doesn't hurt you. Finally, `load_data()` calls `m_load_data()`, which is implemented as an abstract method - it raises an error if the programmer has not provided a version for the subclass.\n \n"

Figures 1 and 2 were created by hand in Adobe Illustrator and PowerPoint, respectively. The data for Figure 2 and Table 4 are sent to standard output\n- The figures were generated in such a way that they scale appropriately to how they will be displayed in the paper - either they will have a width of 7 inches or 3.25 inches. The windows themselves are approximately the same size but the line widths, text, etc. is set so that they all have the same size when shrunk down to the paper's size.
