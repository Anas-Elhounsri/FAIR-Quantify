The discovered entities are typically components or variables in CellML models, but as the annotated content on PMR continues to grow the pool of potentially relevant entities similarly grows. With our current focus on epithelial transport in the kidney, this demonstration is tuned toward the kinds of entities most commonly found in models of such systems - e.g., fluxes of solutes typically found in renal epithelial cells (sodium, potassium, ammonium...) and processes occuring in, or between, the lumen, cytosol, and interstitial compartments. \nPresented in the screenshot below is an example of discovered entities from PMR for the entered text `flux of sodium`. From these results, the user can access further information on each discovered entity to help them determine which may be most relevant to their work. The additional information usually consists of the name of the model, component name and variable name; associated biological information about the entity deposited in PMR; protein names; and species and genes used during the experiments. \n![Example MDT session](public/img/UseCaseDiagram.png)\n*A screenshot illustrating an example MDT session, where the user has queried for any entities relevant to the text \"flux of sodium\".*\n \n"

Currently we define a dictionary of common phrases that the potential users of renal epithelial cell models might be interested in and use that to map the entered text to the semantic queries.

This system will appear as a collapsible window when the user will click a model across the apical or basolateral membrane. Presented above is an example of a CellML model entity - `flux of sodium` in the Weinstein model after clicking the Weinstein model. Initially this system gives a brief description of the clicked model followed by some suggestions from the annotation in PMR. By using this system the user will get existing transporters located in the basolateral membrane which transport the sodium solute. Also, alternative models of this model from various workspaces, and related kidney models have been provided for further exploration.
