Samples should come from a pool of (untagged) individuals of the same species so the microsatellite selection can be optimized. SSR selection will be performed based on the number of alleles of each SSR loci, so the more heterogeneous is the sample, the better will be the final result. Reads must come from a microsatellite library built using a restriction enzyme and following an enrichment protocol. The idea behind the enrichment protocol after digestion is to have a random representation from the whole genome where the target SSR motifs will be the most represented strands in the final library. A fragment size selection is then performed on the enriched library to keep only fragments of an average length lower than the maximum sequencing length so both paired-ends reads overlap when merged later on. The final fragment size is important for microsatellite screening and must comprise the full SSR pattern (variable in length) and the two flanking regions with fair length for primer design. \n"
