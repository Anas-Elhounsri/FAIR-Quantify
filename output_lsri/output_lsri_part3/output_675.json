Given that most network analyses can only handle positive interactions, we normalized the SparCC correlation matrix from -1 to 1 to a range from 0 to 1, except for the structural balance analysis which directly uses the positive and negative correlation values. The dashboard includes the calculation of large scale metrics of the network, structural balance analysis and community/HDBSCAN subnetwork analysis.

The \"Kombucha_abundance_table.txt\" can be used as input to run the UMAP/HDBSCAN and SparCC modules.

The kombucha example can be easily inspected using the web dashboard at [MicNet dashboard](http://micnetapplb-1212130533.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com). \nAs a case study we used the Domos Archean data set described in [Espinosa-Asuar et al. 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.04.433984v1.full), a database with more than 2,000 OTUs.

To do this, you must first have the *conda* package manager installed. If you do not have it installed, we recommend that you install the miniconda or anaconda packages. You can find the instructions to install it at this link:\n\n[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n\n[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)\n\nOnce you have conda working on your computer the process is the following:\n\n1. First be sure to be situated in the MicNet repository folder that you have clone into your computer. Then, the first step to run the dashboard is to create the environment, thus, first you must run the following code in the command line or terminal:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    conda env create -f environment.yml \n    ~~~\n\n    Be sure to check if the environment was created by typing in your command line the following:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    conda env list \n    ~~~\n\n    You should see MicNet-env listed among your environments.\n\n2. If the MicNet-env environment is in the list, you then need to activate it using the following code:\n\n    ~~~bash\n    conda activate  MicNet-env\n    ~~~\n\n3. Finally, you just need to run the following code to get the web app running, NOTE that this app will be using your computer's computational resources (disk and RAM), thus giving you more power than the one we provide with free memory resources [here](http://micnetapplb-1212130533.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com). \n    \n    ~~~bash\n    streamlit run app.py\n    ~~~\n\n    The application will open in your browser at the port: localhost:8501\n"
