        "value": "- \"Error: too low  percentage of reads mapped\" \nThis error is issued if less than 50%  of the read pairs are mapped. In this case, it is likely that there is a problem. Check if you selected the correct species. If you selected the correct species, several problems are possible: \n     - There is a contamination of adapters in the fastq. Adapters are not removed before  processing. Thus, if you have a contaminatioin, it is possible that you loose too many reads. In this case clip the adpters before usinig HiCRes, and make sure to keep only read pairs, in the same order ni both fastq files. \n     - There is a contamination with another species. If your samples are contaminated (by mixing bymistake to samples with the same index for example), your samples are not usable. You can seperate the species by mapping on chimeric genome your reads and selecting the one mapping on your genome of interest, but this solution is for troubleshooting only, and not recommanded to perform further analysis as you  have a risk to introduce a bias in your data. \n- \"Warning: low percentage of valid interactions\" and \"Warning: low proportioin of cis interactions.\" \nIn both cases, this indicates a poor quality for the library. HiCRes will still compute the resolution, but it is recommended to try to improve the experimental conditions before sequencing deeper. In the case of low cis interactions proportion, it is especially important to work with the resolution computed from cis or cis-far interactions only. \nThis should be preceded by preseq error message. Use this message for refering to preseq documentation if you want to understand why preseq failed. When preseq fails, the library yields in function of the sequencing depth cannot be predicted. In this case, HiCRes will issue a warning and predict the resolution in function of the unique valid read pairs sequenced, instead of the toatl number of the  total number of read pairs sequenced (including duplicates). \nThis error is likely caused by bedtools not workinig properly. If you get this error while running HiCRes on processed data, make sure the genome index (.chrom.sizes file) you gave to HiCRes corresponds to genome used to process the data. \nThere are several steps that require sorting of big files, using the function sort. It has been configured to use a temporary folder created in the output directory. This error could be caused by a lack of memory in this directory. \nThis error occurs either if the equation.txt file has not been generated (unkown error), or if the equation has not been predicted (most likely). In this second case, an equation.txt file should be present in the output directory, containing the error details instead of the final equation. The error is the absence of linearity of the cube root of the distribution of the mapped reads in function of the cube root of the read number or in function of the cube root of the windows size (specified in the equation.txt file). This may happen if you mixed several libraries together. This tool cannot process several libraries. The linearity of the distribution is the main condition to extract the equation to predict the resolution of the library in function of the depth. Thus, if the distribution is not linear, it is unfortunately impossible to make any prediction. If you are analysing a single library, trying to start with a deeper library may improve that.\n \n"

The fast version of the bam option (bam_fast) is in beta mode. See the Fast modes section bellow for more information.\n\n-s, --species [hg38,mm10,TAIR10,ce10,dm3]     The species (genome name) from which the sample comes from. Either hg38 for human, mm10 for mouse, TAIR10 for A. thaliana, ce10 for C. elegans or dm3 for D. melanogaster. This is required for method raw and is ignored for method bam.\n\n-e, --enzyme [HindIII,MboI,Arima]     The restriction digestion method, either HindIII for HindIII digestion, MboI for MboI digestion or Arima, for the Arima kit. This is required for method raw and is ignored for method bam.\n\n-c, --chromsize <path to file>     The path to index of the genome used to anaylze the HiC, for method bam and bam_fast only.\n\n-1, --fastq_1 <path to file>     The path to the first end of the sequenced reads, in fastq or fastq.gz format. For method raw only.\n\n-2, --fastq_2 <path to file>     The path to the second end of the sequenced reads, in fastq or fastq.gz format. For method raw only.\n\n-b, --bam <path to file>     The path to bam file of the valid read pairs, for method bam and bam_fast only.\n\n-t, --threads <int>     The number of threads to use. Default is 1.\n"
