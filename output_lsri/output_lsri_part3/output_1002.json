This document will be amended periodically to keep it up-to-date. In case of any dispute, the most current version will apply.\n:::\n\nAn up-to-date list of members of the nf-core core team can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/about).\n\nOur Safety Officers are Saba Nafees, Cris Tu\u00f1\u00ed, and Michael Heuer.\n\nnf-core is a young and growing community that welcomes contributions from anyone with a shared vision for [Open Science Policies](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/taxonomy/term/8). Open science policies encompass inclusive behaviours and we strive to build and maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals.\n\nWe have therefore adopted this CoC, which we require all members of our community and attendees of nf-core events to adhere to in all our workspaces at all times. Workspaces include, but are not limited to, Slack, meetings on Zoom, gather.town, YouTube live etc.\n\nOur CoC will be strictly enforced and the nf-core team reserves the right to exclude participants who do not comply with our guidelines from our workspaces and future nf-core activities.\n\nWe ask all members of our community to help maintain supportive and productive workspaces and to avoid behaviours that can make individuals feel unsafe or unwelcome. Please help us maintain and uphold this CoC.\n\nQuestions, concerns, or ideas on what we can include? Contact members of the Safety Team on Slack or email safety [at] nf-co [dot] re.\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nMembers of the Safety Team (the Safety Officers) are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.\n\nThe Safety Team, in consultation with the nf-core core team, have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this CoC, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nMembers of the core team or the Safety Team who violate the CoC will be required to recuse themselves pending investigation. They will not have access to any reports of the violations and will be subject to the same actions as others in violation of the CoC.\n\n## When and where does this Code of Conduct apply?\n\nParticipation in the nf-core community is contingent on following these guidelines in all our workspaces and events, such as hackathons, workshops, bytesize, and collaborative workspaces on gather.town. These guidelines include, but are not limited to, the following (listed alphabetically and therefore in no order of preference):\n\n- Communicating with an official project email address.\n- Communicating with community members within the nf-core Slack channel.\n- Participating in hackathons organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events).\n- Participating in collaborative work on GitHub, Google Suite, community calls, mentorship meetings, email correspondence, and on the nf-core gather.town workspace.\n- Participating in workshops, training, and seminar series organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events). This applies to events hosted on web-based platforms such as Zoom, gather.town, Jitsi, YouTube live etc.\n- Representing nf-core on social media. This includes both official and personal accounts.\n\n## nf-core cares \ud83d\ude0a\n\nnf-core's CoC and expectations of respectful behaviours for all participants (including organisers and the nf-core team) include, but are not limited to, the following (listed in alphabetical order):\n\n- Ask for consent before sharing another community member\u2019s personal information (including photographs) on social media.\n- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We are all here to learn from one another and a difference in opinion can present a good learning opportunity.\n- Celebrate your accomplishments! (Get creative with your use of emojis \ud83c\udf89 \ud83e\udd73 \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\ude4c !)\n- Demonstrate empathy towards other community members. (We don\u2019t all have the same amount of time to dedicate to nf-core. If tasks are pending, don\u2019t hesitate to gently remind members of your team. If you are leading a task, ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.)\n- Engage with and enquire after others. (This is especially important given the geographically remote nature of the nf-core community, so let\u2019s do this the best we can)\n- Focus on what is best for the team and the community. (When in doubt, ask)\n- Accept feedback, yet be unafraid to question, deliberate, and learn.\n- Introduce yourself to members of the community. (We\u2019ve all been outsiders and we know that talking to strangers can be hard for some, but remember we\u2019re interested in getting to know you and your visions for open science!)\n- Show appreciation and **provide clear feedback**. (This is especially important because we don\u2019t see each other in person and it can be harder to interpret subtleties. Also remember that not everyone understands a certain language to the same extent as you do, so **be clear in your communication to be kind.**)\n- Take breaks when you feel like you need them.\n- Use welcoming and inclusive language. (Participants are encouraged to display their chosen pronouns on Zoom or in communication on Slack)\n\n## nf-core frowns on \ud83d\ude15\n\nThe following behaviours from any participants within the nf-core community (including the organisers) will be considered unacceptable under this CoC. Engaging or advocating for any of the following could result in expulsion from nf-core workspaces:\n\n- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following and sustained disruption of communication among participants of the community. This includes hijacking shared screens through actions such as using the annotate tool in conferencing software such as Zoom.\n- \u201cDoxing\u201d i.e. posting (or threatening to post) another person\u2019s personal identifying information online.\n- Spamming or trolling of individuals on social media.\n- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, jokes, or unwelcome sexual attention.\n- Verbal and text comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or work experience.\n\n### Online Trolling\n\nThe majority of nf-core interactions and events are held online. Unfortunately, holding events online comes with the risk of online trolling. This is unacceptable \u2014 reports of such behaviour will be taken very seriously and perpetrators will be excluded from activities immediately.\n\nAll community members are **required** to ask members of the group they are working with for explicit consent prior to taking screenshots of individuals during video calls.\n\n## Procedures for reporting CoC violations\n\nIf someone makes you feel uncomfortable through their behaviours or actions, report it as soon as possible.\n\nYou can reach out to members of the Safety Team (Saba Nafees, Cris Tu\u00f1\u00ed, and Michael Heuer) on Slack. Alternatively, contact a member of the nf-core core team [nf-core core team](https://nf-co.re/about), and they will forward your concerns to the Safety Team.\n\nIssues directly concerning members of the Core Team or the Safety Team will be dealt with by other members of the core team and the safety manager \u2014 possible conflicts of interest will be taken into account. nf-core is also in discussions about having an ombudsperson and details will be shared in due course.\n\nAll reports will be handled with the utmost discretion and confidentiality.\n\nYou can also report any CoC violations to safety [at] nf-co [dot] re. In your email report, please do your best to include:\n\n- Your contact information.\n- Identifying information (e.g. names, nicknames, pseudonyms) of the participant who has violated the Code of Conduct.\n- The behaviour that was in violation and the circumstances surrounding the incident.\n- The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made).\n- Other people involved in the incident, if applicable.\n- If you believe the incident is ongoing.\n- If there is a publicly available record (e.g. mailing list record, a screenshot).\n- Any additional information.\n\nAfter you file a report, one or more members of our Safety Team will contact you to follow up on your report.\n\n## Who will read and handle reports\n\nAll reports will be read and handled by the members of the Safety Team at nf-core.\n\nIf members of the Safety Team are deemed to have a conflict of interest with a report, they will be required to recuse themselves as per our Code of Conduct and will not have access to any follow-ups.\n\nTo keep this first report confidential from any of the Safety Team members, please submit your first report by direct messaging on Slack/direct email to any of the nf-core members you are comfortable disclosing the information to, and be explicit about which member(s) you do not consent to sharing the information with.\n\n## Reviewing reports\n\nAfter receiving the report, members of the Safety Team will review the incident report to determine whether immediate action is required, for example, whether there is immediate threat to participants\u2019 safety.\n\nThe Safety Team, in consultation with members of the nf-core core team, will assess the information to determine whether the report constitutes a Code of Conduct violation, for them to decide on a course of action.\n\nIn the case of insufficient information, one or more members of the Safety Team may contact the reporter, the reportee, or any other attendees to obtain more information.\n\nOnce additional information is gathered, the Safety Team will collectively review and decide on the best course of action to take, if any. The Safety Team reserves the right to not act on a report.\n\n## Confidentiality\n\nAll reports, and any additional information included, are only shared with the team of safety officers (and possibly members of the core team, in case the safety officer is in violation of the CoC). We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nWe will not name harassment victims, beyond discussions between the safety officer and members of the nf-core team, without the explicit consent of the individuals involved.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nActions taken by the nf-core\u2019s Safety Team may include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Asking anyone to stop a behaviour.\n- Asking anyone to leave the event and online spaces either temporarily, for the remainder of the event, or permanently.\n- Removing access to the gather.town and Slack, either temporarily or permanently.\n- Communicating to all participants to reinforce our expectations for conduct and remind what is unacceptable behaviour; this may be public for practical reasons.\n- Communicating to all participants that an incident has taken place and how we will act or have acted \u2014 this may be for the purpose of letting event participants know we are aware of and dealing with the incident.\n- Banning anyone from participating in nf-core-managed spaces, future events, and activities, either temporarily or permanently.\n- No action.\n\n## Attribution and Acknowledgements\n\n- The [Contributor Covenant, version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4)\n- The [OpenCon 2017 Code of Conduct](http://www.opencon2017.org/code_of_conduct) (CC BY 4.0 OpenCon organisers, SPARC and Right to Research Coalition)\n- The [eLife innovation sprint 2020 Code of Conduct](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/code-of-conduct/)\n- The [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines v3.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) (version 3.1, CC BY-SA 3.0 Mozilla)\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.4 - February 8th, 2022\n\n- Included a new member of the Safety Team.

        "value": "# nf-core/mag: Contributing Guidelines\n\nHi there!\nMany thanks for taking an interest in improving nf-core/mag.\n\nWe try to manage the required tasks for nf-core/mag using GitHub issues, you probably came to this page when creating one.\nPlease use the pre-filled template to save time.\n\nHowever, don't be put off by this template - other more general issues and suggestions are welcome!\nContributions to the code are even more welcome ;)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you need help using or modifying nf-core/mag then the best place to ask is on the nf-core Slack [#mag](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/mag) channel ([join our Slack here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).\n\n## Contribution workflow\n\nIf you'd like to write some code for nf-core/mag, the standard workflow is as follows:\n\n1. Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the [nf-core/mag issues](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/issues) to avoid duplicating work. If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this\n2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [nf-core/mag repository](https://github.com/nf-core/mag) to your GitHub account\n3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository following [Pipeline conventions](#pipeline-contribution-conventions)\n4. Use `nf-core schema build` and add any new parameters to the pipeline JSON schema (requires [nf-core tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) >= 1.10).\n5. Submit a Pull Request against the `dev` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged\n\nIf you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) or even their [excellent `git` resources](https://try.github.io/).\n\n## Tests\n\nYou have the option to test your changes locally by running the pipeline. For receiving warnings about process selectors and other `debug` information, it is recommended to use the debug profile. Execute all the tests with the following command:\n\n```bash\nnf-test test --profile debug,test,docker --verbose\n```\n\nWhen you create a pull request with changes, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will run automatic tests.\nTypically, pull-requests are only fully reviewed when these tests are passing, though of course we can help out before then.\n\nThere are typically two types of tests that run:\n\n### Lint tests\n\n`nf-core` has a [set of guidelines](https://nf-co.re/developers/guidelines) which all pipelines must adhere to.\nTo enforce these and ensure that all pipelines stay in sync, we have developed a helper tool which runs checks on the pipeline code. This is in the [nf-core/tools repository](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) and once installed can be run locally with the `nf-core lint <pipeline-directory>` command.\n\nIf any failures or warnings are encountered, please follow the listed URL for more documentation.\n\n### Pipeline tests\n\nEach `nf-core` pipeline should be set up with a minimal set of test-data.\n`GitHub Actions` then runs the pipeline on this data to ensure that it exits successfully.\nIf there are any failures then the automated tests fail.\nThese tests are run both with the latest available version of `Nextflow` and also the minimum required version that is stated in the pipeline code.\n\n## Patch\n\n:warning: Only in the unlikely and regretful event of a release happening with a bug.\n\n- On your own fork, make a new branch `patch` based on `upstream/master`.\n- Fix the bug, and bump version (X.Y.Z+1).\n- A PR should be made on `master` from patch to directly this particular bug.\n\n## Getting help\n\nFor further information/help, please consult the [nf-core/mag documentation](https://nf-co.re/mag/usage) and don't hesitate to get in touch on the nf-core Slack [#mag](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/mag) channel ([join our Slack here](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).\n\n## Pipeline contribution conventions\n\nTo make the nf-core/mag code and processing logic more understandable for new contributors and to ensure quality, we semi-standardise the way the code and other contributions are written.\n\n### Adding a new step\n\nIf you wish to contribute a new step, please use the following coding standards:\n\n1. Define the corresponding input channel into your new process from the expected previous process channel\n2. Write the process block (see below).\n3. Define the output channel if needed (see below).\n4. Add any new parameters to `nextflow.config` with a default (see below).\n5. Add any new parameters to `nextflow_schema.json` with help text (via the `nf-core schema build` tool).\n6. Add sanity checks and validation for all relevant parameters.\n7. Perform local tests to validate that the new code works as expected.\n8. If applicable, add a new test command in `.github/workflow/ci.yml`.\n9. Update MultiQC config `assets/multiqc_config.yml` so relevant suffixes, file name clean up and module plots are in the appropriate order. If applicable, add a [MultiQC](https://https://multiqc.info/) module.\n10. Add a description of the output files and if relevant any appropriate images from the MultiQC report to `docs/output.md`.\n\n### Default values\n\nParameters should be initialised / defined with default values in `nextflow.config` under the `params` scope.\n\nOnce there, use `nf-core schema build` to add to `nextflow_schema.json`.\n\n### Default processes resource requirements\n\nSensible defaults for process resource requirements (CPUs / memory / time) for a process should be defined in `conf/base.config`. These should generally be specified generic with `withLabel:` selectors so they can be shared across multiple processes/steps of the pipeline. A nf-core standard set of labels that should be followed where possible can be seen in the [nf-core pipeline template](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/master/nf_core/pipeline-template/conf/base.config), which has the default process as a single core-process, and then different levels of multi-core configurations for increasingly large memory requirements defined with standardised labels.\n\nThe process resources can be passed on to the tool dynamically within the process with the `${task.cpus}` and `${task.memory}` variables in the `script:` block.\n\n### Naming schemes\n\nPlease use the following naming schemes, to make it easy to understand what is going where.\n\n- initial process channel: `ch_output_from_<process>`\n- intermediate and terminal channels: `ch_<previousprocess>_for_<nextprocess>`\n\n### Nextflow version bumping\n\nIf you are using a new feature from core Nextflow, you may bump the minimum required version of nextflow in the pipeline with: `nf-core bump-version --nextflow . [min-nf-version]`\n\n### Images and figures\n\nFor overview images and other documents we follow the nf-core [style guidelines and examples](https://nf-co.re/developers/design_guidelines).\n\n## GitHub Codespaces\n\nThis repo includes a devcontainer configuration which will create a GitHub Codespaces for Nextflow development! This is an online developer environment that runs in your browser, complete with VSCode and a terminal.\n\nTo get started:\n\n- Open the repo in [Codespaces](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/codespaces)\n- Tools installed\n  - nf-core\n  - Nextflow\n\nDevcontainer specs:\n\n- [DevContainer config](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)\n"

        "description": "\r\n### `Added`\r\n\r\n- [#350](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/350) - Adds support for CheckM as alternative bin completeness and QC tool (added by @jfy133 and @skrakau)\r\n- [#353](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/353) - Added the busco_clean parameter to optionally clean each BUSCO directory after a successful (by @prototaxites)\r\n- [#361](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/361) - Added the skip_clipping parameter to skip read preprocessing with fastp or adapterremoval. Running the pipeline with skip_clipping, keep_phix and without specifying a host genome or fasta file skips the FASTQC_TRIMMED process (by @prototaxites)\r\n- [#365](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/365) - Added CONCOCT as an additional (optional) binning tool (by @jfy133)\r\n- [#366](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/366) - Added CAT_SUMMARISE process and cat_official_taxonomy parameter (by @prototaxites)\r\n- [#372](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/372) - Allow CAT_DB to take an extracted database as well as a tar.gz file (by @prototaxites).\r\n- [#380](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/380) - Added support for saving processed reads (clipped, host removed etc.) to results directory (by @jfy133)\r\n- [#394](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/394) - Added GUNC for additional chimeric bin/contamination QC (added by @jfy133)\r\n\r\n### `Changed`\r\n\r\n- [#340](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/340),[#368](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/368),[#373](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/373) - Update to nf-core 2.7.2 `TEMPLATE` (by @jfy133, @d4straub, @skrakau)\r\n- [#373](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/373) - Removed parameter `--enable_conda`. Updated local modules to new conda syntax and updated nf-core modules (by @skrakau)\r\n- [#385](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/385) - CAT also now runs on unbinned contigs as well as binned contigs (added by @jfy133)\r\n- [#399](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/399/files) - Removed undocumented BUSCO_PLOT process (previously generated `*.busco_figure.png` plots unsuitable for metagenomics) (by @skrakau).\r\n\r\n### `Fixed`\r\n\r\n- [#345](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/345) - Bowtie2 mode changed to global alignment for ancient DNA mode (`--very-sensitive` mode) to prevent soft clipping at the end of reads when running in local mode. (by @maxibor)\r\n- [#349](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/349) - Add a warning that pipeline will reset minimum contig size to 1500 specifically MetaBAT2 process, if a user supplies below this threshold. (by @jfy133)\r\n- [#352](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/352) - Escape the case in the BUSCO module that BUSCO can just detect a root lineage but is not able to find any marker genes (by @alexhbnr)\r\n- [#355](https://github.com/nf-core/mag/pull/355) - Include error code 21 for retrying with higher memory for SPAdes and hybridSPAdes (by @mglubber)\r\n\r\n### `Dependencies`\r\n\r\n| Tool      | Previous version | New version |\r\n| --------- | ---------------- | ----------- |\r\n| BUSCO     | 5.1.0            | 5.4.3       |\r\n| BCFtools  | 1.14             | 1.16        |\r\n| Freebayes | 1.3.5            | 1.3.6       |\r\n| SAMtools  | 1.15             | 1.16.1      |",
