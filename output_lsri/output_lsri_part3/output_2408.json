BIRDS will download the necessary image files (Allen Reference Atlas, average template, annotation file) and generate 5 folders as: \u201ccache\u201d, \u201cgenerate\u201d, \u201cregistration\u201d, \u201cvisual\u201d and \u201cdl\u201d to store all intermediate data and final outputs. 2: Importing image datasets into Fiji. If the data is not in TIFF format, users should convert it to a TIFF sequence format. This can be easily done in Fiji as well. Then, click the \u201cchoose\u201d button to select the image (the selected image name will be automatically displayed in the text box). Coronal view is the default view in our program (starting plane at the olfactory bulb). Users can convert their images to coronal view through the \u201cReslice\u201d function in Fiji. The image resolution is set in the text box. In BIRDS, X and Y correspond to the horizontal and vertical axes of the coronal plane, respectively, and Z is the direction of the AP axis. We provided test data at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.37pvmcvj9. After downloading the test data file to birdsDemo folder, the test dataset \u201cYH298.tif\u201d (brain 1) can be imported in Fiji for testing the software. 3: To accurately down-sample the imported experimental datasets, which might be obviously deformed by tissue clearing, users need to identify the corresponding feature planes on the experimental data and Allen template.

Three image datasets usable for registration are: \u201cinvert\u201d, brain images with grayscale reversed along three axes; \u201cPC\u201d, brain images with the edge and texture features extracted by phase congruency; \u201craw\u201d, the original brain images (red box 1). While \u201craw\u201d is required for registration, the selection of \u201cinvert\u201d or \u201cPC\u201d is optional (check/uncheck the check boxes). With selecting the \u201cinvert\u201d dataset, users will enter the manual parameter setting step (red box 3), which is further described in 3.2. In addition, please enter a weighting factor for each group of image dataset in the textbox. The typical weighting factors for three channels could be 0.25: 1.25: 1.25 for STP data, and 1: 0.75: 2.25 for light-sheet data. <br> \n2. Select the registration model and the number of iterations (red box 3). The default setting for this step is a hybrid \u201crigid + affine + B-spline\u201d registration model with 800 iterations, which means, all checkboxes are checked. A user who wants to obtain the registration result in a short time can just check \u201cbspline\u201d and only use the \u201craw\u201d image for B-spline registration. This will possibly take only 5~8 minutes to obtain a less accurate result. <br> \n3. Unlike PC feature images generated by the computer automatically, the generation of \u201cinvert\u201d image requires manual operations to define the three axial planes for further feature enhancement by grayscale reversion. The \u201cinvert\u201d part shows the number of marker lines labelled for defining the three axis planes, respectively. By clicking the \u201cYZ\u201d button, user can switch the views of three types of marker lines (yellow for defining yz plane, orange for defining xy plane and blue for define xz plane). The \u201cdelete\u201d button allows the modification of the marker lines, and \u201cinvert\u201d button inverts the grayscale according to the finally defined axes.

If the brain shows very symmetrical coronal planes, users can also mark two lines on the same coronal slice.<br> \nIn a similar way, for defining the XZ plane, users can mark two horizontal lines on two coronal slices (e.g., at ~210th layer of average template, at which the corpus callosum is about to converge; and ~600th layer of average template, at which the inverted triangle appears).

        "value": "BIRDS is written in Java 1.8.0 and Python 3.6.1, and links to Imaris software module. The software runs on the Fiji platform. The deep-learning prediction module requires a Python environment, and the visualization and quantitative analysis are based on Imaris. To run the program smoothly, we recommend a computer workstation running Windows 10 with at least 6 CPU cores, 128Gb of RAM and SSD disks. A configuration with 256GB RAM / 8 CPU cores or above will allow better performance. A good graphic card (e.g., GeForce RTX 2080 Ti) is recommended for implementing efficient computation. In addition, if Imaris is used for 3D digital framework mapping and data analysis, a large-capacity hard drive (e.g., 4Tb or larger) is also required to save the cached data. It should be noted that the output of BIRDS is partially determined by the parameters set, users with different experiences may obtain different results. Therefore, it is recommended to use the default parameters preset in the program. "
