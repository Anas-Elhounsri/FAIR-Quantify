We provide [binary packages](#binary-packages) for various Linux distributions.\n   If your Linux distribution is supported, this is the easiest way to install Discrover.\n2. For Ubuntu, aside from packages, we also offer a [personal package archive (PPA)](#personal-package-archive).\n   Usage of the PPA is recommended over manually installing packages.\n3. For other Linux distributions we provide [source-based packages](#source-based-packages) scripts that automatically build Discrover for you.\n4. Should none of the above steps work for, we also have instructions on [how to build](BUILDING.md) Discrover.\n\nNote that below, we frequently write ``X.Y.Z`` to indicate the version number (and sometimes ``X.Y.Z-R`` for version number and package release number).\nYou have to replace it with whatever version of Discrover that you want to install.\n\n# Binary packages\nBinary packages of Discrover are [available](https://github.com/maaskola/discrover/releases) for select Linux distributions.\nGenerally, these packages specify dependent software that is required for full functionality of Discrover.\nYour distribution's package management  will install dependencies alongside Discrover.\n\nThe packages were built for 64-bit architectures and are available for:\n\n* Debian 7.7 (Wheezy)\n* Fedora 20\n* Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)\n\nThe binary packages were generated with the specifications found in [another repository](https://github.com/maaskola/discrover-packages).\n\nOnce downloaded, these packages can be installed as follows.\n\n## Debian\n\nJust use ``dpkg`` to install the package:\n\n```sh\ndpkg -i discrover-X.Y.Z_amd64_debian_wheezy.deb\n```\n\n## Fedora\n\nYou can install with ``yum``:\n\n```sh\nyum install discrover-X.Y.Z-R.fc20.x86_64.rpm\n```\n\nTo update just use\n\n```sh\nyum update discrover-X.Y.Z-R.fc20.x86_64.rpm\n```\n\n## Ubuntu\n\n### Personal Package Archive\nA Ubuntu [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~maaskola/+archive/ubuntu/discrover) has been set up that can be used for installing Discrover.\nYou can add this PPA to your system and install Discrover with the following commands (you might have to replace `trusty` with your Ubuntu system's release name):\n\n```sh\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:maaskola/discrover  # fetch and install the PPA's key.\nsudo apt-get update                             # synchronize APT package list\nsudo apt-get install discrover                  # install Discrover\n```\n\n### Manual package installation\nAside from using this PPA, you can also directly download and install a Discrover release package.\nUbuntu being a Debian-derivative, you can use ``dpkg`` to install the package:\n\n```sh\ndpkg -i discrover-X.Y.Z_amd64_ubuntu_trusty.deb\n```\n\n### Comparison of PPA and manual package installation\nNote the following advantage of using the PPA: when future Discrover releases happen your system's Discrover installation will be automatically updated, while you manually have to retreive and install packages if you opt for the latter solution.\nFurther, the PPA also includes packages for 32-bit architectures, as well as older Ubuntu releases.\nIt is thus recommended to use the PPA-based installation for Ubuntu.\n\n\n# Source-based packages\nFor Gentoo and Arch Linux, there are source-based packages available.\nYou can use these to automatically compile and install Discrover.\n\n## Gentoo\n\nEbuilds for Discrover are available [here](https://github.com/maaskola/discrover-packages/tree/master/gentoo/), but are also included in the gentoo-science overlay.\nYou can install this overlay, accept unstable versions of Discrover, and then simply emerge discrover:\n\n```sh\noverlay -a science\necho \"=sci-biology/discrover-X.Y.Z ~amd64\" >> /etc/portage/package.keywords\nemerge -av discrover\n```\n\n## Arch Linux\n\nWe have written a PKGBUILD file for Arch Linux that specifies dependencies and how to build Discrover.\nYou can [get it](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/discrover/) via the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/).\nThe most current version is typically available [here](https://github.com/maaskola/discrover-packages/blob/master/arch/PKGBUILD).\n"

Thus, this is mostly a maintenance release.\n\nAll Coverity issues, except for one false-positive, have been fixed in this release. Among these issues was an uninitialized variable, the other issues were were minor:\n- some exceptions that Boost might throw are now handled; likely, these exceptions would never have been generated anyway, as they did not depend on any user input at all, and were thus far never observed.\n- Coverity (falsely) complained that stream states were not restored; this was in fact done, which Coverity did not recognize, but the handling has now been improved.\n  The remaining Coverity issue is a false-positive: Coverity reports a likely copy-paste error, which however is definitely none.\n",

        "description": "Apart from documentation improvements, there is only one user-facing new feature in this release: BED files of the occurrences of discovered motifs are now generated.\n\nA small bug was fixed in the sequence plotting code introduced in the previous release series (very small, yet non-zero probabilities led to plotting problems).\n\nThe release offers improved documentation:\n- the manual is more comprehensive and offers recipes for motif analysis of ChIP-Seq data and of next-generation sequencing data for RNA-binding proteins.\n- the command line help has also been improved and explains more options accurately and in detail.\n\nFurthermore, error handling has been improved and additional warnings have been implemented. A consequence of this is that erroneous input is now gracefully handled with informative messages, rather than leading to program abortion. For example when the user unintentionally provides a non-FASTA file or an empty FASTA file, a warning is emitted.\n\nFinally, this release also incorporates changes suggested by the [Coverity Scan service](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3884) which help to make the motif discovery experience with Discrover more robust.\n",

        "description": "This release introduces new, [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/)-based sequence logo plotting code.\n\nThe previous solution, `tikzlogo`, was a Ruby script that generated LaTeX/TikZ code, compiled that to PDF, and also generated PNG files with the help of `convert` from Imagemagick. Now, `discrover` uses the new Cairo-based code and by default immediately generates PDF and PNG sequence logos of the discovered motifs. Also `plasma` can generate sequence logos (although it doesn't do that by default, and you have to use the options `--pdf` and `--png` if you wish so). \n\nThe same Cairo-based sequence logo creation routines are also available in a new, separate program `discrover-logo`. This program can create sequence logos from .hmm files, from IUPAC regular expression motifs, as well as from files containing matrix motifs.\n\nThe advantage of relying on Cairo for that job is that it dispenses with having to depend on the presence of relatively large LaTeX installations.\nConversely, Cairo is a relatively small library (at least compared to full LaTeX installations) that is available on all targeted platforms.\n",

        "description": "Plasma, although already quite fast, got a speed-up in this release. This is enabled by a 4-bit sequence encoding which makes matching IUPAC symbols faster. It appears the new release reduces runtime of plasma by a third or so.\n\nAlso, a bug in plasma was fixed that manifested in multi-motif mode.\nWhen looking for multiple motifs, after a motif is found its occurrences in the sequences were masked with `N` characters. This lead to a bug because in the previous IUPAC matching routine there was initially a check whether query and reference characters were identical. Thus, when the query character was fully degenerate, i.e. `N`, then a query `N` would successfully match to a position masked due to a previously found motif occurrence. This bug resulted in over-counting of motifs with `N`s at the beginning or end.\nThe bug was found by comparing differences in the output of the new, 4-bit sequence encoding based approach (which did not use the faulty routine) with the previous one.\nThe bug had no impact when only the top motif was searched for.\n",
