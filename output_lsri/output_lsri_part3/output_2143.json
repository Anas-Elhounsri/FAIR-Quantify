It has also been tested on Apple Mac OSX and CentOS. At least 4G memory is suggested. Alignments benefit from multiple processing threads, via specifying the -p option. The AASRA-index portion is single-threaded. At least 50G of hard disk space is recommended to be available, due to the generation of possible large size of the temporary alignment files.  \n    The total time of analysis depends on genome size, number of reads analyzed, and your equipment. Excluding building bowtie index, we generally have observed run times for alignment runs to take between 20 minutes and 1 hours using default AASRA settings. \n\nALIGNMENT METHODS\n  Details of alignment methods and performance testing\n    For full details on AASRA\u2019s alignment methods and the results of\n    performance testing, see Chong et al. (2016). This is a pre-print of a manuscript\n    that is under peer review as of this writing (March 17, 2016). \n  Reads pre-processing\n    Reads file formats\n    Small RNA index to be aligned must be in fasta formats. The fasta sequence for each small RNA must be in a SINGLE line (NOT multiple lines of sequence for one small RNA). \n    No paired-end support\n    There is no support for paired-end reads in AASRA. Small RNA data\n    are assumed to be single-ended, and represent the 5'-->3' cDNA sequences\n    of cloned RNAs. \n    Unique read names required\n    The small RNA reads must all have unique names within a given file. If\n    this requirement is not met, alignments will be completely unreliable\n    due to errors in interpreting and handling of multi-mapped reads. \n    Adapter trimming\n    AASRA assumes your reads are already trimmed. Trimming\n    simply looks for the right-most exact match to the given apdater\n    sequence, and when found, chops it off. If a read is smaller than 15nts\n    after trimming, it is discarded. For more sophisticated adapter\n    trimming, consider cutadapt or trimmomatic. \n    mismatches\n    By default, AASRA allows up to 1 mismatch for a valid alignment.\n    This helps with sequencing errors and SNPs. If a read has some\n    alignments with 0 mismatches, and some with 1, only those with 0\n    mismatches are kept. The option --mismatches controls this threshold,\n    and can be set to 0, 1, or 2. \n"
