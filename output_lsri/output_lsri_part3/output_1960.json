The preprocessing procedure included log2 transformation and quantile normalization. The corresponding log2 (fold change) was calculated which is a ratio between the disease and control expression levels. \n\n'drug-drug_links.csv': Drug-drug links information according to STITCH. All values were collected from STITCH. The scores for different kinds of types are listed in columns of the detailed scores file. According to the official explanation of the STITCH database, all scores in the files are the same as those on the website, multiplied by 1000 (to make it an integer instead of a floating-point number).\n\n'drug-exposure gene expression profiles.csv': The drug-exposure gene expression profiles drugs obtained from LINCS. The data is LINCS level 5, which has taken into account the correlation of repeated data. On the basis of level 4, level 5 data has weighted the experimental results of the same experimental conditions according to Spearman correlation.\n\n'label.csv': Approved breast cancer drug from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
