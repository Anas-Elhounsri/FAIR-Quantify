Thus, for each sequence *m*, a weight *w_m*  = *1/z_m* is calculated, where *z_m* are all the sequences in the MSA having a hamming distance less than *xN* with the sequence *m*. A threshold value of 0.1 is used as default if the user does not provide any weight file. \n\n   For the last optional input, the user can provide an optional input maximum entropy model to initialize the MPF-BML method. This model may be obtained from some other inference method or from a previous run of the MPF method (the model obtained after running MPF is automatically saved once the MPF method converges) for which the user is interested in running either BML method alone or both MPF (again) and BML methods with a different set of parameters. For the latter, the user needs to check the provided \u201cRun only BML step on user-provided parameters\u201d option in the \u201cInput information\u201d panel.\n\nDifferent datasets are provided in the \"Datasets\" folder in this repository for testing the MPF-BML GUI framework. For demonstration purposes, we will focus here on the data of HIV p7 nucleocapsid protein \"p7-alignment.fasta\" present in this folder. Click the \"Load data\" button and select this dataset and leave the remaining optional inputs blank as shown below.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ahmedaq/MPF-BML-GUI/blob/master/Input_panel_2.png\" width=\"300\">\n"
