It does not install separate copies of Python, but rather\nit does provide a clever way to keep different configurations of\nenvironment cleanly separated.\n\nIf you are on Mac OS X or Linux, one of the following two commands will\nwork for you:\n```bash\n$ sudo easy_install virtualenv\n```\n\nor even better:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo pip install virtualenv\n```\n\nThen, you can create a virtual environment: \n\n```bash\n$ virtualenv venv\n```\n\nand activate it: \n```bash\n$ source venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nFinally, you should install the requirements with:\n```bash\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n or if you want to upgrade the requirements already installed.\n\n```bash \n$ pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n\nInstall into your local Python environment with:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nor open up your favourite IDE to explore the codebase. We use\n[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n\nNow you\\'re ready to get started!\n\n```{admonition} Tip\n:class: tip\n\nFor full instructions on installing and using `virtualenv` see [their\ndocumentation](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org).\n\n`pyenv` is an alternative to virtual, read all about [pyenv here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [here](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/).\n```\n\n***\n## Running tests\n\nThe tests in the ISA-API rely on datasets available in the test branch\nof the [ISAdatasets\nrepository](http://github.com/ISA-tools/ISAdatasets).\n\nThus, the first step for running the tests is to clone that branch to\nthe *tests/data* folder from the root of your\n*isa-api* source code project:\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b tests --single-branch http://github.com/ISA-tools/ISAdatasets tests/data\n```\n\nAfter that, you can run the test with the usual command:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py test\n```\n"

        "description": "## Enhancements and Cleanup:\r\n\r\n### ISA MODEL\r\n- The `model.py` file has been split into the `model` module. Each class has been split into a dedicated file.\r\n- Added a method `from_dict()` to the ISA Investigation class to let users load objects from a dictionary. \r\n- Added a method `to_dict()` to each ISA model class that let users dump ISA objects to dictionaries.  (also see ISA JSONLD section)\r\n- Added a new GraphQL interface to ISA investigation (see below querying isa for more information)\r\n\r\n### ISA TAB\r\n- The `isatab.py` file has been split into the `isatab` module. \r\nFunctions and classes have been split into three submodules: `load` (to read isatab files), `dump` (to write isafiles) and `validate` (to run validation rules against an isatab file). Usage remains the same.\r\n- The isatab validation pipeline have been reworked to allow the rules set to be extended with user custom rules. Please contact us if you would like to implement your own validation rules.\r\n \r\n### ISA JSON\r\n- the `isajson.py` file has been split into the `isajson` module.\r\nFunctions and classes have been split into three files: `load.py`, `dump.py` and `validate.py`. Usage remains the same but there is now an alternative using dicts instead of files (see below)\r\n- `load.py` and `dump.py` are now wrappers. The code of the isa json serializer/deserializer has been moved to be part of the ISA model. Users can still use the old `load()` and `dump()` methods but are now able to do it directly from an investigation object. Example\r\n```py\r\nfrom json import load\r\nfrom isatools.model import Investigation\r\n\r\nisa_json_file = 'path/to/isa.json'  # the json file path\r\nwith open(isa_json_file, 'r') as f:\r\n    isa_json_input = load(f)  # load the dict from the file\r\ninvestigation = Investigation()  # create en investigation\r\ninvestigation.from_dict(isa_json_input)  # feed in the dictionary, will generated missing identifiers make inputs and outputs different\r\nisa_json_output = investigation.to_dict()  # Dump it back to a dict\r\nanother_investigation = Investigation()  # create en investigation\r\nanother_investigation.from_dict(isa_json_output)  # feed in the dictionary\r\nassert investigation == another_investigation  # assert equality between the created investigations.\r\nassert investigation.to_dict() == another_investigation.to-dict()  # compare to_dict() methods\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: identifiers may be missing from the json file and autogenerated by the ISA objects. In this case, output dictionnaries won't match which is why the investigation is being compared to another investigation.\r\n\r\n### ISA JSON-LD\r\n- Using the new `to_dict()` function from model.py, it is possible to produce JSON-LD. \r\nThe The method takes an optional boolean parameter `ld` (default to `False`) that serializes to json-ld dictionaries by injecting `@context`, `@id` and `@type` attributes. See isa json below for more information.\r\n- Customisation of the JSON-LD serialization is achieved through the `set_context()` function of the `model` module.\r\n- Added support for SIO, WD, OBO and SDO annotations (see https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api/tree/master/isatools/resources/json-context).\r\n- Added support for generating URL identifiers (necessary for hosting triple stores).\r\n- Check https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api/blob/master/isa-cookbook/content/notebooks/querying-isa-with-graphql-and-sparql.ipynb for examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n### SPARQL querying over ISA:\r\n- The outputs of the ISA JSON LD serializer have been tested as a valid RDF representation. Using MTBLS instances with [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) and settting the contexts with `set_context(vocab='wd', all_in_one=False, local=False, include_contexts=False)` we were able to produce RDF triples and store them into a virtuosoDB and a berkeleyDB with SPARQL support.\r\n- Check https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api/blob/master/isa-cookbook/content/notebooks/querying-isa-with-graphql-and-sparql.ipynb for examples.\r\n\r\n### GRAPHQL querying over ISA:\r\n- Each ISA Investigation now has a graphQL interface bound to it. \r\nA full documentation of the graphQL interface is available at https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api/tree/master/isatools/graphQL/README.md\r\n\r\n### MTBLS, the EMBL-EBI MetaboLights Client:\r\n- Refactored the MTBLS client but kept the same functions (and signature) exposed. You can now use MTBLInvestigation instead of the old functions. Example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom isatools.net.mtbls import MTBLSInvestigation\r\n\r\ninvestigation =  MTBLSInvestigation('MTBLS1')\r\n# This creates a temp dir for the investigation that gets deleted when the object is destroyed through the automatic garbage collector. You can pass a directory if you want to persist the investigation.\r\ninvestigation =  MTBLSInvestigation(mtbls_id='MTBLS1', output_directory=\"path/to/output/dir\", output_format='tab')\r\n\r\n# You can then run all the old function through methods with the same name and chain methods without downloading the whole investigation again.\r\nprint(investigation.get_characteristics_summary())\r\nprint(investigation.get_factor_names())\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ISA SQL:\r\n- Created a relational SQL Alchemy model for ISA objects tested with PSQL and SQLite. All model files are available here: https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api/tree/master/isatools/database/models\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6538906/218466975-fb27f898-056c-4869-8e06-2b73d3345357.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n### Versions update:\r\n- Dropped python 3.6 and 3.7\r\n- Added compatibility for python 3.10 (production ready)\r\n- Added compatibility for python 3.11 (test only)\r\n- Bump numpy, pandas and mzml.\r\n\r\n### Cookbook\r\n- Added a cookbook for querying isa with sparql and grapql. See https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api/blob/master/isa-cookbook/content/notebooks/querying-isa-with-graphql-and-sparql.ipynb\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\n- The application has been further tested with CI, especially the model. Global coverage increased from 75% to 84%.\r\n- Build time was reduced due to mocking some network operations.\r\n\r\n### ISA-API performance profiler:\r\n- Added a small command line interface using cProfile to generate performance reports of different ISA features (in particular serialization and deserialization to tab and json).\r\n\r\n### Known issues:\r\n- There is a know performance issue with the coveralls/coverage modules on python 3.11 making the build very slow (see https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1287). Performances for end users shouldn't be affected.\r\n\r\n### Contributors:\r\n- Batista Dominique, University of Oxford (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2109-489X)\r\n- Philipoe Rocca Serra, University of Oxford (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9853-5668)",

        "description": "# Release v0.12.0\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n - Added the  `isatools.create.connectors` module. This module contains the `generate_study_design_from_config` function to generate an `isatools.create.StudyDesign` from a JSON configuration document containing metadata about the study design, including sampling and assay plan. These JSON documents can be generated by the [Datascriptor](https://gitlab.com/datascriptor/datascriptor) application.(issues #355, #356, #377)\r\n - Added support for observational variables to `isatools.create.model.StudyArm` (with the parameter `source_characteristics`) (PR #367)\r\n -  `StudyDesign.generate_isa_study()`now generates one `Assay` per assay type (via `StudyDesign._generate_samples()`). (issue #369, #373)\r\n- The names of the assay nodes (extract, labelled, extract, protocol node, and data file) (issue #370, #373)\r\n- `isatools.create.model.ProductNode` now has an attribute `extension` (e.g. a file extension fo a `DataFile` node) (issue #378)\r\n\r\nEnhancements and Cleanup:\r\n - Introduced support for (built-in, non-configurable) synonyms in protocol types. Protocol types have also been made case insensitive. (issue #382)\r\n - Refactored constants and error messages for the create mode, introducing the modules `isatools.create.constants` and `isatools.create.errors` (issue #342, #368)\r\n - Removed asterisk imports (`*`) from all the core modules (issue #368)\r\n - Removed leftover `print()` statements (issue #374)\r\n - overall test coverage increased from 67% to 75%. The increase is due both to an increase in the number of tests and the removal of some deprecated, experimental or spurious modules.\r\n\r\nBreaking changes:\r\n- `isatools.create.models` has been renamed to `isatools.create.model` (issue #368)\r\n- `IsaModelAttributeError` has been replaced with `AttributeError`. We will favour standard Exceptions whenever applicable.\r\n\r\nBug Fixes:\r\n- Fixed typo in NAME_PROPERTY_ASSIGNMENT_ERROR (issue #328)\r\n- Silent expansion of `Characteristic` categories from `str` to `OntologyAnnotation` now supported. You can assign a string to a characteristic category and it will be automatically wrapped into an ontology annotation.

We have also introduced some (mostly) minor fixes to the core ISA API, enforcing a stricter validation on some objects.\r\n\r\nAmong the most noteworthy changes there are:\r\n* Support of complex longitudinal study designs with the introduction of `Element`, `Treatment`, `StudyCell` and `StudyArm` classes #318, #321\r\n* Increased flexibility of the sample and assay plans, with the introduction of the `AssayGraph` and the overhaul of the `SampleAssayPlan` class, now renamed `SampleAndAssayPlan` #329, #333, #296\r\n* Increased flexibility for Quality Control support through the `QualityControlService` utility class \r\n* Reworked serialization to JSON/deserialization from JSON of all the study design objects #313\r\n* Check added when submitting quantitative Parameter Values: only numerical values are allowed #347\r\n\r\nFor more information on the known issues with this release, please check the documentation at http://isatools.readthedocs.org\r\n",
