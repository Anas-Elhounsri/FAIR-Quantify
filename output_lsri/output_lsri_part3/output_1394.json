The right side contains a **graph for visualizing the created pathway**. Circular-shaped nodes are metabolites (in KEGG referred to as compounds), and diamond-shaped nodes are reactions. Nodes are connected by edges, which display the direction of a metabolic reaction. After uploading experimental data, a further user interface emerges, showing the mapping of the data set to the pathway. After sample selection, by clicking on the respective button on the bottom of the tool, **reaction nodes are colored dependent on their abundance in the sample** and the color settings. Information about abundances in all samples for a specific reaction is available by clicking on the respective reaction- node.\n![\"Pathway-Creator\"](https://github.com/danielwalke/MPA_Pathway_Tool/blob/main/images/Figure%201_Screenshots%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9CPathway-Creator%E2%80%9D%20of%20the%20MPA_Pathway_Tool.png \"Figure 1: Screenshot of the \u201cPathway-Creator\u201d of the MPA_Pathway_Tool\")\n**Figure 1: Screenshot of the \u201cPathway-Creator\u201d of the MPA_Pathway_Tool** \n"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
