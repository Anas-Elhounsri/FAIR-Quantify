Due to the complex structural variations that can be observed when comparing multiple individuals of the same species, an effective and intuitive visualization of a pan-genome is challenging.  \nPGV is reference-agnostic representation and visualization of pan-genomes. It is a novel representation method based on the notion of consensus ordering that enables an intuitive, effective and interactive visualization of a pan-genome. The utility of such representation is visualized on  a web-based pan-genome browser that can present complex structural genomic variations.\n \n"

To obtain the best results, input genomes must have a similar level of contiguity.  \nFirst, PGV carries out a genome-wide multiple sequence alignment on all the inputs using [progressiveMauve](http://darlinglab.org/mauve/user-guide/progressivemauve.html). The output of progressiveMauve is used to convert genome sequences into block orderings consisted of C/D/U blocks. C-block (core) corresponds to an alignment that contains all n individuals; D-block (dispensable) corresponds to an alignment which contains at least two individuals and at most n\u22121. U-block (unique), is a block that belongs exclusively to one individual genome. After the conversion of each genome into blocks, PGV computes the consensus ordering for the C-blocks, which will constitute the \u201cback-bone\u201d of the pan-genome.  \nThere are three different output formats of PGV:\n  (i) dotplot comparing n genome orderings with consensus ordering\n  (ii) [PGV Genome Viewer](http://pgv.cs.ucr.edu) for blocks with actual coordinates\n  (iii) PGV Genome Viewer for blocks with gapped coordinates aligned with consensus \n"

The value of numOfChrms allows our tool to \u201cundo\u201d the concatenation of all input sequences carried out by progressiveMauve, that is, it allows our tool to split chromosomes (or contigs or scaffolds) for the dotplot and BED files generation. \n\nIf the user sets numOfChrms to a number smaller than the actual number of chromosomes, only the first numOfChrms chromosomes will be split for the dotplot and in the BED files. For instance if the user sets numOfChrms=2 when the number of chromosomes is 5, PGV will split the first two chromosomes and store their results as \u201cchr1\u201d and \u201cchr2\u201d. The sequence for chr3, chr4, and chr5 will stay concatenated together, and all the block orderings will be displayed as if they were one long sequence named \u201ccontig\u201d in dotplot/bed files.\n\nEven if numOfChrms is set \u201cincorrectly\u201d, all data included in input FASTA files will be processed by progressiveMauve and PGV to identify different types of blocks and their consensus ordering.\n\nRun PGV pipeline as:\n```\npgv -c config_file\n```\n\nExample:\nTo run PGV on Arabidopsis pan-genomes with 4Mb sequences on chromosome three for three different accessions\n\n```\npgv -c /Users/PGV/pgv/sample/config\n\nFinished processing multiple sequence alignments\nBuilt consensus sucessfully\nGenerated output BED files. Please visit pgv.cs.ucr.edu to view these.\nGenerated dotplots between each assembly and consensus sequence\n```\nThis will generate a dotplot comparing core blocks of each accession to consensus ordering. \n<img src=\"docs/figs/arabidopsisDotplot.png\" width=\"600\">\n\nThis will also generate three unaligned BED files for the input genomes to be viewed in PGV Genome Viewer. All blocks are at their actual coordinates along each genome. Here for block C9, it is at different locations at each genome.\n![panviz\\[fig3\\]](docs/figs/arabidopsisPGVUnaligned.png)\n\nIf BED files are set to be aligned by `BEDaligned`, C-blocks will be gapped and aligned to their corresponding ordinates on consensus ordering. Here for the same block C9, it is at same locations for each genome as in consensus ordering.\n![panviz\\[fig4\\]](docs/figs/arabidopsisPGVAligned.png)\n"
