The architecture is based on the standard protocol for these experiments:\n- Add media to each of the wells in a 96-well plate. It could be the same media for all wells, or different media for each well, depending on what the experimenter is trying to test.\n- Add a small sample of an existing bacterial culture to each of the wells. Again, these could be the same for all wells, or different initial conditions could be tested in parallel.\n- Let the bacteria grow while stirring or shaking for some fixed time T.\n- Pipette a small fraction of each of the wells into a well on a new plate, with fresh media (added according to the same protocol as in step 1).\n- Repeat the previous two steps as many times as desired.\n\nCommunities can also be run in chemostat mode, where nutrients are continually supplied and populations continuously diluted.  \n"
