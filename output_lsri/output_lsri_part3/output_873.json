        "value": "To construct supertrees and explore the underlying phylogenomic information from gene trees. Clann implements several well known supertree methods (including the ability to apply bootstrapping to them) can calculate consensus trees and provides methods to manage sets of gene trees, pruning selected taxa, filtering based on a number of criteria, automatically pruning species-specific duplicates and more. Also implemented is a gene-tree reconciliation approach to try to utilise genetic information from more than just single-copy gene-trees, this can be used as a criterion for estimating species trees. Feed back on these approaches are welcome! Finally, Clann can also calculate Robinson-Doulds (RF) and SPR distances between sets of trees, create randomised versions of sets of trees and implementes a PTP test for informativeness (the YAPTP test) of a set of trees provided. Clann has been continually developed since 2003 and suggestions for new features and tools are welcome. \n"
