All variants with a non-reference genotype\n  call will be used (both alleles are considered for diploid calls)\n* Illumina reads in FASTQ file(s).\n\nFor example, if you have two call sets in the files `calls1.vcf` and `calls2.vcf`,\nthen run:\n\n```\nminos adjudicate --reads reads1.fq --reads reads2.fq out ref.fasta calls1.vcf calls2.vcf\n```\n\nwhere `reads1.fq` and `reads2.fq` are FASTQ files of the reads and `ref.fasta`\nis a FASTA of the reference corresponding to the two input VCF files.\nThe final call set will be `out/final.vcf`.\n\n"
