Fork GitHub repository and clone to your local machine\n\n1. Install dependencies\n\n    ```\n    # Install package dependencies\n    if (!requireNamespace(\"remotes\", quietly = TRUE))\n      install.packages(\"remotes\")\n    remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\n\n    # Install developlment-only dependencies\n    install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\n    # Install local copy of workflowr\n    devtools::install()\n    ```\n\n## More about this repository\n\nFor the most part, I try to follow the guidelines from [R packages][r-pkg] by\n[Hadley Wickham][hadley]. The unit tests are performed with [testthat][], the\ndocumentation is built with [roxygen2][], and the online package documentation\nis created with [pkgdown][].\n\nMinimal continuous integration testing is performed by GitHub Actions for each\npush to the repository. Extensive continuous integration testing is performed at\nscheduled intervals in [workflowr-pkg-tests][]. Code coverage is calculated with\n[covr][] and [Codecov][]. The online package documentation is automatically\ngenerated by running pkgdown from GitHub Actions and pushing to the gh-pages\nbranch.\n\nThe template files used by `wflow_start()` to populate a new project are defined\nin the list `templates` in the file `R/infrastructure.R`. The [RStudio project\ntemplate][pt] is configured by `inst/rstudio/templates/project/wflow_start.dcf`.\nThe repository contains the files `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md` to both adhere to\n[R package conventions for defining the license][r-exts-licensing] and also to\nmake the license clear in a more conventional manner (suggestions for\nimprovement welcome). The directory `scripts/` contains convenience scripts for\nmaintaining the R package. The remaining directories are standard for R packages\nas described in the manual [Writing R Extensions][r-exts].\n\n## Scripts for maintaining the package\n\nConvenience scripts for maintaining the package are located in `scripts/`. These\nare not included in the package tarball for distribution. They are all intended\nto be executed from the root directory of the package. The convenience scripts\ninclude:\n\n* `build.sh` runs `R CMD build` and `R CMD check`\n* `bump-version.R` bumps the version across all the necessary package files\n* `contribute.R` performs some basic checks that should be run before\ncontributing a Pull Request\n* `document.R` regenerates the documentation\n* `gather-dependencies.R` extracts the dependencies from `DESCRIPTION` to create\nthe vector `dependencies` in `R/zzz.R` (which is used to confirm that all the\npackages that workflowr needs are properly installed)\n* `sed.sh` performs search/replace for all R files in the package\n\n## Release checklist (for maintainers)\n\n* Bump version with [scripts/bump-version.R](scripts/bump-version.R)\n* Update [NEWS.md](NEWS.md): Check `git log` and make sure to reference GitHub\nIssues/PRs\n* Check spelling with `spelling::spell_check_package()` and update\n`inst/CITATION` as needed\n* Run [scripts/document.R](scripts/document.R) to update Rd files, install the\npackage locally, and preview the online documentation with [pkgdown][] (No need\nto commit `docs/` because the pkgdown site is rebuilt and deployed automatically\nby GitHub Pages after each push)\n* Run [scripts/build.sh](scripts/build.sh) to confirm tests pass locally\n* Test on [rhub][]:\n    * Have to validate email first with `rhub::validate_email()`. Copy-paste\n    token from email into R console\n    * Check on Ubuntu with `rhub::check_for_cran(platform = \"ubuntu-gcc-devel\")`\n    * Check on Solaris with `rhub::check_for_cran(platform = \"solaris-x86-patched\")`\n* Test on [winbuilder][]:\n    * Check with R devel with `devtools::check_win_devel()`\n* Update [cran-comments.md](cran-comments.md)\n* Commit with `git commit -am \"Bump version: x.x.x.x -> x.x.x\"`\n* Push with `git push origin main` and wait for CI builds to pass\n* Build tarball with `R CMD build .` and upload to [CRAN submission\nsite][cran-submit]. You will receive an email to request confirmation, then an\nemail confirming the package was submitted, and then an email with the test\nresults. Once it is accepted to CRAN, monitor the [check results][check-results]\nfor any surprise errors. Also, these builds are when the binaries are built for\nWindows and macOS, so they aren't available until they are finished. You will\nreceive an email once all the Windows binaries are available for download\n(devel, release, oldrel).\n* You can monitor the status of the CRAN submission with the [foghorn][]\npackage:\n\n    ```R\n    foghorn::cran_incoming(\"workflowr\")\n    foghorn::cran_details(\"workflowr\")\n    foghorn::cran_results(pkg = \"workflowr\")\n    ```\n* Tag with `git tag -a vx.x.x`. Summarize [NEWS.md](NEWS.md) entry into bullet\npoints. Run ` git tag -l -n9` for past examples. Push with `git push origin\n--tags`.\n* Make a release. On GitHub, go to Releases -> Tags -> Edit release notes. Name\nthe release \"workflowr x.x.x\" and copy-paste the Markdown entry from\n[NEWS.md](NEWS.md).\n\n[check-results]: https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_workflowr.html\n[Codecov]: https://codecov.io/\n[contribute]: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668#sec011\n[covr]: https://github.com/jimhester/covr\n[cran-submit]: https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html\n[foghorn]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=foghorn\n[git-tutorial]: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668\n[hadley]: http://hadley.nz/\n[pkgdown]: https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown\n[pt]: https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio_project_templates.html\n[r-exts]: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html\n[r-exts-licensing]: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Licensing\n[r-pkg]: https://r-pkgs.org/\n[rhub]: https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/\n[roxygen2]: https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen\n[style]: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html\n[testthat]: https://github.com/hadley/testthat\n[winbuilder]: https://win-builder.r-project.org/\n[workflowr-pkg-tests]: https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr-pkg-tests\n"

        "description": "This minor release includes some new features, improved documentation, and bug\r\nfixes.\r\n\r\n## Minor improvements\r\n\r\n* New argument `combine` for `wflow_build()` and `wflow_publish()`. When Rmd\r\nfiles are specified with the argument `files`, they are built in addition to any\r\nRmd files that are automatically built when setting arguments like `make = TRUE`\r\nand `republish = TRUE`. If you would instead like to only build Rmd files that\r\nare included in all the filters, you can set `combine = \"and\"` to take the\r\nintersection. For example, if you ran \r\n`wflow_build(\"analysis/example*.Rmd\", make\r\n= TRUE, combine = \"and\")`,\r\nthen this would only build those Rmd files matched by\r\nthe file glob `analysis/example*.Rmd` and had been modified more recently than\r\ntheir corresponding HTML file. With the default, `combine = \"or\"`, this would\r\nhave built all the files that matched the file glob in addition to any files\r\nthat had been modified more recently than their corresponding HTML file, even if\r\nthey didn't match the file glob pattern (idea from @bfairkun in #221,\r\nimplementation by @zaynaib in #227, #228)\r\n\r\n* If `wflow_publish()` is called, but was not instructed which files to publish,\r\nit now throws an error. In other words, you must specify the files you wish to\r\npublish or use one of the convenience arguments like `republish = TRUE` or\r\n`update = TRUE`. It's previous behavior was to complete without having done\r\nanything, which was misleading (idea from @stephens999)\r\n\r\n* It is now easier to enter commit messages with a separate title and body. If\r\nyou pass a character vector to the argument `message` to any of the functions\r\nthat perform a commit, e.g. `wflow_publish()`, the first element will be used as\r\nthe title, and any subsequent elements will be separate paragraphs in the commit\r\nbody. Using a separate title and body will improve the display of your commit\r\nmessages on GitHub/GitLab and `git log --oneline` since these only show the\r\ntitle (suggestion from @LearnUseZone in #222, implementation by @zaynaib in #225)\r\n\r\n* New argument `only_published` for `wflow_toc()`. If set to `FALSE`, then the\r\ntable of contents will also include unpublished files (implemented by @giocomai\r\nin #234)\r\n\r\n## Updated documentation\r\n\r\n* Improved organization of [reproducible research workshop\r\nvignette][vig-workshop] (thanks to @stephens999)\r\n\r\n[vig-workshop]: https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-09-workshop.html\r\n\r\n* Added more documentation to `wflow_build()` to explain when it does and\r\ndoesn't load code defined in a `.Rprofile` file (idea from @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Bug fix: Now workflowr will detect any problems with its dependencies when it\r\nis attached. All dependencies must be installed, loadable, and meet the minimum\r\nrequired version. Broken packages were causing cryptic, misleading errors\r\n(reported by in @markellekelly in #216 and @LearnUseZone in #217)\r\n\r\n* Bug fix: `wflow_quickstart()` can now handle relative paths to the Rmd files\r\nwhen the working directory is changed (`change_wd = TRUE`, which is the default)\r\n\r\n* Remove Rd warnings when installing package on Windows by explicitly specifying\r\nthe topic page when cross-referencing an exported function from another package.\r\nNote that the links worked previously, so this change is just being proactive in\r\ncase this warning starts getting strongly enforced. If the authors of the other\r\npackage rearrange how they group functions into documentation topics, this will\r\nbreak the cross-references and require an update. See this\r\n[thread][rs-community-rd-warning] for more details\r\n\r\n[rs-community-rd-warning]: https://community.rstudio.com/t/file-link-quasiquotation-in-package-rlang-does-not-exist-and-so-has-been-treated-as-a-topic/55774\r\n\r\n* Bug fix: `wflow_use_github()` and `wflow_use_gitlab()` now use Font Awesome 5\r\nsyntax to insert icons into the navigation bar when a recent version of\r\nrmarkdown is installed (>= 2.6) (bug report from @christianholland, #231)\r\n\r\n* Bug fix: `wflow_open()` no longer sends a warning if you are using\r\n`bookdown::html_document2` as your primary output format in `_site.yml` with\r\n`base_format: workflowr::wflow_html` (bug report from @rgayler, #233)\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n* Removed function `wflow_update()`. Its only purpose was to migrate projects\r\ncreated with [workflowrBeta][], which is now over 3 years old\r\n\r\n* Bump minimum required version of R from 3.2.5 to 3.3.0. While workflowr itself\r\nshould be able to continue to work fine with R 3.2.5, it was becoming too much\r\nof a burden to regularly test workflowr with R 3.2.5 as the RStudio engineers\r\nhave started updating their packages to require a minimum of R 3.3.0\r\n\r\n* Require minimum versions of callr 3.7.0, knitr 1.29, rmarkdown 1.18\r\n\r\n* Switched to the workflowr repository itself to use the default branch \"main\"\r\nand changed the owner to the workflowr organization. This has no effect on\r\nworkflowr projects (future or existing). It mainly affects contributors to\r\nworkflowr development. However, please update any links you might have\r\nbookmarked (e.g. to documentation)\r\n",

        "description": "## New features\r\n\r\n* New function `wflow_run()`. It executes the code chunks of an R Markdown file\r\nin the current R session without affecting any of the website files. This is\r\nmeant to be used while interactively developing an analysis. It does not change\r\nthe working directory or isolate the computation from the current R session.\r\nThis is analogous to the RStudio option \"Run all\" to run all the code chunks\r\n(idea from @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n* New autosave feature. The workflowr functions `wflow_build()`,\r\n`wflow_publish()`, and `wflow_status()` will autosave any unsaved files open in\r\nthe RStudio editor pane. This is similar to the behavior of the Knit HTML\r\nbutton. This feature can be disabled by setting the package option\r\n`workflowr.autosave` to `FALSE` (idea from @xiangzhu in #179)\r\n\r\n* New [vignette][vig-data] on using large data files in a workflowr project\r\n(motivated by @xiangzhu, #183)\r\n\r\n[vig-data]: https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/articles/wflow-10-data.html\r\n\r\n* If there are merge conflicts after running `wflow_git_pull()`, and the merge\r\nwas allowed to proceed (`fail = FALSE`), then the conflicted files are listed\r\nand optionally opened in RStudio at the first line of the conflict that needs\r\nto be resolved\r\n\r\n* `wflow_git_config()` has a new argument `overwrite`. Previously\r\n`wflow_git_config()` would by default overwrite any previous settings. Now this\r\nwill throw an error. To overwrite a previous setting, set `overwrite = TRUE`\r\n([idea][f1000-config-overwrite] from @petebaker)\r\n\r\n[f1000-config-overwrite]: https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1749/v1#referee-response-55117\r\n\r\n## Minor improvements and bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Warn user if only HTML file has been committed (and avoid throwing an error).\r\nPreviously this threw an error because workflowr expects the R Markdown file to\r\nbe committed to the Git repo if its corresponding HTML file is\r\n(bug report from @kevinlkx)\r\n\r\n* Warn user if a dependency does not meet the minimum required version. There\r\nare multiple ways this could happen. First, it is possible to install an old\r\nversion after having installed workflowr. Second, when running\r\n`install.packages()`, if the minimum required version is available in any of the\r\npackage libraries, it is not installed. However, if the version of the package\r\nin the first directory listed in `.libPaths()` does not meet the minimum\r\nrequired version, it is still the one that is loaded when workflowr is loaded\r\n(idea from @stephens999)\r\n\r\n* Fix off-by-one date bug by specifying the local timezone (see [git2r Issue\r\n407][git2r407])\r\n\r\n[git2r407]: https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/issues/407\r\n\r\n* Fix bug when path to project includes a space. The bug was introduced in\r\nversion 1.5.0 with the feature to use the system Git executable to run `git ls-files`.\r\nTo fix the issue in version 1.5.0, set `options(workflowr.sysgit = \"\")`\r\nin the file `.Rprofile` (bug report from @wolfemd, #180)\r\n\r\n* Fix bug caused by an unset timezone. If the machine has no timezone set,\r\nworkflowr will default to Etc/UTC\r\n\r\n* Handle missing title/pagetitle warning from pandoc 2+ and rmarkdown 1.18+\r\n(see [rmarkdown Issue 1355][rmarkdown1355])\r\n\r\n[rmarkdown1355]: https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/pull/1355#issuecomment-558817744\r\n\r\n* Improve speed of `wflow_publish()`/`wflow_status()` by using the system Git\r\nexecutable (if available) to obtain the last commit time of the analysis files\r\n(this is used to determine which published Rmd files are outdated and need to be\r\nrepublished)\r\n\r\n* Report exact command to run `git push` or `git pull` in the terminal if either\r\n`wflow_git_push()` or `wflow_git_pull()` fail (reported by @jennysjaarda, #182)\r\n\r\n* Update FAQ to include how to create a PDF using the RStudio Knit button\r\n(reported by @han16)\r\n\r\n* Update citation to [workflowr publication](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20843.1)\r\n\r\n* Properly quote the Git executable with `shQuote()` whenever Git is called\r\nfrom R\r\n",

Pass it\r\nyour existing R Markdown file(s), and it will start a new workflowr project,\r\npublish the analysis files, and configure GitHub (or GitLab).\r\n\r\n```\r\nwflow_quickstart(files = \"existing-analysis.Rmd\", username = \"your-github-username\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Package options\r\n\r\nThis is the first release to include options for controlling the behavior of all\r\nworkflowr functions. This makes it more convenient for you to create a\r\nconsistent workflowr experience. You can set the options in your project's\r\n`.Rprofile` (using the function `options()`) instead of having to always\r\nremember to change a default argument every time you call a function.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two workflowr package options. See `?workflowr` for more\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n* `workflowr.git`: Set the path to the system Git executable, which is\r\noccasionally used to increase the speed of Git operations performed by workflowr\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n* `workflowr.view`: Should workflowr functions open webpages for viewing in the\r\nbrowser? The default is set to `interactive()` (i.e. it is `TRUE` only if it is\r\nan interactive R session). This option is currently used by `wflow_build()`,\r\n`wflow_git_push()`, and `wflow_publish()`.\r\n\r\n## Workshop tutorial for teaching workflowr\r\n\r\nThe new vignette \"Reproducible research with workflowr\" is designed to be taught\r\nas a tutorial in a workshop setting. It includes setup instructions, an example\r\nanalysis to highlight the benefits of workflowr, and troubleshooting advice.\r\n\r\n## Suppress the HTML workflowr report\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to suppress the workflowr report at the top of an HTML page, you\r\ncan set the option `suppress_report` to `TRUE`. To suppress the report in every\r\nHTML file, set the option in `_workflowr.yml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsuppress_report: TRUE\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo suppress the report in a specific HTML file, add the following to the YAML\r\nheader of the corresponding Rmd file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nworkflowr:\r\n  suppress_report: TRUE\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @kaneplusplus for implementing this feature! (#168)\r\n\r\n## Minor improvements and bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Require git2r >= 0.26.0 to support internal changes that increase speed and\r\nrobustness of workflowr Git functionality\r\n\r\n* `wflow_start()` adds a `.gitattributes` file that classifies R Markdown files\r\nas R code for the official GitHub language statistics calculated via\r\n[linguist][]. The default setting is to ignore R Markdown files.\r\n\r\n[linguist]: https://github.com/github/linguist\r\n\r\n* Address [callr 3.3.0 bug][callr-bug-3.3.0] that writes objects to the global\r\nenvironment, causing the workflowr check of the global environment to fail. The\r\nfailed check now explains that the problem can be fixed by updating the callr\r\npackage.\r\n\r\n[callr-bug-3.3.0]: https://github.com/r-lib/callr/commit/9f7665e1081da6f5134b214da694b4461d05659f\r\n\r\n* Warn user from `wflow_build()` if `index.Rmd` is missing the\r\nworkflowr-specific site generator `wflow_site()` (idea from @pcarbo, #177)\r\n\r\n* Fail early if missing required file `index.Rmd`\r\n\r\n* Add argument `fail` to `wflow_git_pull()` with default value of `TRUE`. Now if\r\na pull generates a merge conflict, `wflow_git_pull()` will abort the pull. Thus\r\nno changes will be made to the local files. Users can set `fail = FALSE` to allow\r\nGit to add the merge conflicts to the local files.\r\n\r\n* Speed improvements for `wflow_publish()`\r\n\r\n* Improved error handling when files contain merge conflicts. Before workflowr\r\nonly detected merge conflicts in Rmd files. Now it detects them for any file\r\n(since Git requires any merge conflicts to be resolved before it makes any new\r\ncommits).\r\n\r\n* Warn user if `knit_root_dir` (the directory where the code in the Rmd files is\r\nexecuted) defined in `_workflowr.yml` is an absolute path. An absolute path\r\nwould only work on the current computer, limiting reproducibility.\r\n\r\n* Include Git status in output of `wflow_status()`. Note that it purposefully\r\nexcludes any files in the website directory since these generated files should\r\nonly be committed by workflowr. You can omit the Git status by setting\r\n`include_git_status = FALSE` (idea from @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n* Make it clearer that you have two options for creating the remote repository on\r\nGithub: 1) let `wflow_use_github()` do it automatically, or 2) create it yourself\r\nmanually at https://github.com/new (idea from @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n* New FAQ \"How can I save a figure in a vector graphics format (e.g. PDF)?\"\r\n\r\n* Added citation to [F1000Research\r\npaper](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20843.1). Run\r\n`citation(\"workflowr\")` to obtain the new citation information.\r\n\r\n* Fixed `wflow_start()` infinite recursion bug by requiring stringr >=1.3.0\r\n\r\n* Added httpuv as imported dependency so that `wflow_use_github()` is able to\r\nautomatically create the GitHub repository via the httr package\r\n\r\n* Set (or increased) minimum required versions for fs, git2r, httpuv,\r\nrstudioapi, stringr, whisker, clipr, shiny, testthat, and withr\r\n\r\n* Document possible error of a greyed out GitHub authentication button when\r\ntrying to give permission for workflowr to create a repository for your account\r\n\r\n* Fixed bug in date displayed in table of past versions in the workflowr report.\r\nDepending on the time of day the commit was made, the displayed day may have\r\nbeen off by one.\r\n",

        "description": "This minor release of workflowr features further GitHub integration, a new\r\nreproducibility check, and various improvements and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* The initial GitHub setup always included the manual step of creating the\r\nGitHub repository, but this is no longer the case! When you run\r\n`wflow_use_github(\"username\")`, it will offer to create the new GitHub\r\nrepository for you. If you sign-in to GitHub via your web browser and grant\r\nworkflowr permission, it will be created automatically.\r\n\r\n* Absolute paths to files on your local computer are not reproducible. If you or\r\nsomeone else tries to execute the code on a different machine, it will fail. Now\r\nworkflowr will automatically search for absolute paths to files that are inside\r\nof the workflowr project. If it detects any, it will fail the reproducibility\r\ncheck, and provide you with the equivalent relative paths to use.\r\n\r\n* Now every time you push your latest changes with `wflow_git_push()`, a new\r\nbrowser tab will automatically be opened to your online repository\r\n(idea from @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n## Minor improvements and bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Mention `knitr::include_graphics()` as an option for including external images\r\n(idea from @Zepeng-Mu, #162)\r\n* Check if Git repository is locked and produce error message that explains how\r\nto fix it (idea from @brimittleman)\r\n* Document that `wflow_build()` and `wflow_publish()` build the files in the\r\ngiven order if they are provided explicitly to the argument `files` (idea from\r\n@antass and @pcarbo, #164)\r\n* Handle spaces in chunk names for HTML targets. If a chunk name contains a\r\nspace, the name of the figure file will also has a space. This broke the\r\naccompanying link for the HTML button with the table of previous versions of the\r\nfigure (because it uses the filename to be unique). Now the spaces are removed\r\nin the HTML link.\r\n* Add FAQ entry on installing packages in a workflowr project (idea from\r\n@xiangzhu, #160)\r\n* `wflow_use_github()`/`wflow_use_gitlab()` provide better guesses if the\r\narguments `username` or `repository` are left blank. If `repository` is `NULL`,\r\nit is set to the name of the workflowr project directory (idea from @pcarbo).\r\n* `wflow_git_push()` and `wflow_git_pull()` no longer accept direct URLs to\r\nremote repositories. The argument `remote` must be `NULL` or the name of an\r\nexisting remote. The support for direct URLs was likely rarely used since it is\r\nrarely used with Git as well, and it likely never worked given how the\r\nunderlying functions from [git2r][] work.\r\n* Document in the GitLab vignette that the repository will be automatically\r\ncreated the first time the repository is pushed with `wflow_git_push()` (this is\r\na feature unique to GitLab)\r\n\r\n[git2r]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=git2r",

        "description": "This release overhauls the layout of the reproducibility report, adds support\r\nfor GitLab, introduces some safety checks and warnings related to caching,\r\nprovides more documentation, and more.\r\n\r\n## Full support for GitLab\r\n\r\nWhile it has always been possible to host workflowr projects using platforms\r\nother than GitHub, it was less convenient and not all the features were\r\nsupported. With this release, a workflowr project hosted on GitLab has all the\r\nsame features as a workflowr project hosted on GitHub, including links to past\r\nversions of the R Markdown, HTML, and figure files. It's also possible to use\r\nworkflowr with GitHub Enterprise or a custom GitLab instance, but you'll have to\r\ncoordinate with your administrators to make sure it's possible to host the\r\nwebsite.\r\n\r\n* Create vignette \"Hosting workflowr websites using GitLab\" (written with\r\n@lazappi, #112)\r\n* Add argument `domain` to `wflow_git_remote()` to allow specifying any remote\r\nGit host, e.g. `domain = \"gitlab.com\"`\r\n* Create function `wflow_use_gitlab()` to automate GitLab setup\r\n\r\n## Reproducibility report and other layout changes\r\n\r\nThe layout of the reproducibility report and other content that workflowr\r\ninserts in the HTML output has been overhauled to be both highly informative but\r\nalso collapsed by default. This way the information is there if you need it, but\r\notherwise is minimally distracting.\r\n\r\n* Collapse the reproducibility report (suggested by @timtrice, #110)\r\n* Collapse the \"Session information\" chunk (suggested by @xiangzhu, #120)\r\n* Convert table of past figure versions to a collapsable button (suggested by\r\n@xiangzhu, #120)\r\n* Improve formatting of tables of past version of files using [Bootstrap table\r\nclasses][bootstrap-tables]\r\n* Remove the footer\r\n* Report the knit directory (where the code was executed) in the workflowr\r\nreport\r\n* Link to workflowr GitHub repository no longer automatically inserted into\r\nnavigation bar. Use either `wflow_use_github()` or `wflow_use_gitlab()` to\r\ninsert a link to your workflowr project into the navigation bar\r\n\r\n## Improved support for caching\r\n\r\nA popular knitr/rmarkdown feature is caching slow-running chunks. This can be\r\nproblematic for workflowr because it assumes that the results are newly created\r\nwhen `wflow_publish()` publishes the results with a given version of the code.\r\nIn this release, workflowr now provides warnings, safety checks, and some\r\nconvience arguments for safely using caching.\r\n\r\n* Include a check in the reproducibility report that reports any existing cached\r\nchunks\r\n* A warning is inserted directly in the HTML file after any code chunk that is\r\ncached (`cache=TRUE`) but is not set to re-run if its upstream chunks are\r\nchanged (`autodep=FALSE`)\r\n* Add argument `clean_fig_files` to `wflow_build()`. The default for\r\n`wflow_build()` is `FALSE`, so that old figures are not removed. This is useful\r\nfor iterative development when plots from cached chunks may not be regenerated\r\nduring a build. However, `clean_fig_files` is fixed to `TRUE` for\r\n`wflow_publish()` to ensure that the final results are produced during the\r\nbuild (suggested by @lazappi, #113)\r\n* Add argument `delete_cache` to `wflow_build()`/`wflow_publish()`. The defult\r\nis `FALSE`, but if set to `TRUE` it will delete the cache directory prior to\r\nbuilding each R Markdown file. This helps ensure reproducibility of the\r\npublished results\r\n* Have `wflow_build()` send message about status of cache directory\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new vignette on GitLab, this release has multiple other new\r\nvignettes plus updates to existing ones.\r\n\r\n* Add vignette \"Sharing common code across analyses\"\r\n(written with @timtrice, #111, #142)\r\n* Add vignette \"Alternative strategies for deploying workflowr websites\"\r\n    * Password-protected site with Amazon S3 (written by @edavidaja, #124)\r\n    * Secure sharing with Beaker Browser (written by @johnsonlab, #59, #65)\r\n* Update getting started vignette to use new function `wflow_use_github()`\r\n* Add section \"Style with custom CSS\" to customization vignette\r\n* Add FAQ entry \"How can I include external images in my website?\"\r\n* Add code of conduct\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n* Improve support for hosting on Shiny Server. Setting the option\r\n`fig_path_ext: false` in `_workflowr.yml` removes the file extension from the\r\nfigure subdirectories, allowing them to be viewed on Shiny Server (implemented\r\nby @Tutuchan, #119, #122)\r\n* Insert warning into HTML if user configures the knitr chunk option\r\n`fig.path`, which workflowr ignores (idea from @lazappi, #114)\r\n* Add argument `disable_remote` to `wflow_start()`. It creates a Git [pre-push\r\nhook][pre-push-hook] that disables the ability to push to a remote repository.\r\nUseful for confidential projects. Currently only available for Linux and macOS\r\n(suggested by @rgayler, #141)\r\n* Refactor and export the individual functions of `wflow_html()` to facilitate\r\nintegrating workflowr features into other R Markdown output formats such as\r\n[blogdown][] (suggested by @docmanny, #126)\r\n* New function `wflow_rename()` to rename files and directories, including\r\ncommitting the change with Git\r\n* Use [fs][] internally to improve cross-platform handling of file paths\r\n* Have `wflow_publish()`/`wflow_git_commit()` fail early if any of the files\r\nhave merge conflicts\r\n* Switch from [rawgit][] to [raw.githack][] to serve past versions of HTML files\r\n(#134)\r\n* Have `wflow_git_push()` set the upstream tracking branch by default (see\r\n[git2r Issue 375][git2r-375])\r\n* Have `wflow_build()` report the current working directory. If the knit\r\ndirectory (where the code is executed) is different than the working directory,\r\nhave `wflow_build()` report where the code in each file is being executed\r\n* As usual, some minor bug fixes, improved error handling, and more tests\r\n\r\n[blogdown]: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown\r\n[bootstrap-tables]: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_tables.asp\r\n[fs]: https://github.com/r-lib/fs\r\n[git2r-375]: https://github.com/ropensci/git2r/issues/375\r\n[pre-push-hook]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks\r\n[rawgit]: https://rawgit.com/\r\n[raw.githack]: https://raw.githack.com/\r\n",

Critically, it makes workflowr\r\ncompatible with the latest release of [git2r][].\r\n\r\n[git2r]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=git2r\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable changes are 1) `wflow_publish()`/`wflow_status()` are now\r\nmuch faster, especially if your project has many R Markdown files and/or many\r\nGit commits, 2) the rmarkdown package is no longer loaded automatically when you\r\nload workflowr, and 3) the new function `wflow_open()` (based on a previous\r\nversion in [workflowrBeta][]) to open new or existing R Markdown files.\r\n\r\n[workflowrBeta]: https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowrBeta\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Resurrect `wflow_open()`. Since there is no longer a workflowr template in\r\nworkflowr 1.0+, it creates a file with a minimal YAML header (@xiangzhu, #107)\r\n* Add bibliography before session information (reported by @docmanny, #102)\r\n* Add argument `verbose` to `wflow_build()`/`wflow_publish()` to display the\r\nbuild log in the R console as each file is built. Useful for monitoring\r\nlong-running code chunks (idea from @pcarbo)\r\n* Argument `dry_run` added to `wflow_start()`\r\n* S3 print method for `wflow_start()`\r\n* Updates to `wflow_view()`:\r\n    * Renamed argument `recent` to `latest` to display the most recently\r\n    modified HTML file\r\n    * The argument `files` now requires correct paths to existing R Markdown or\r\n    HTML files. Previously, `wflow_view()` would guess the correct path. While\r\n    convenient, it was also potentially confusing since it was inconsistent with\r\n    the other workflowr functions\r\n    * The argument `latest` is no longer mutually-exclusive with `files`. If the\r\n    most recently modified HTML is different than those specified by `files`,\r\n    they will all be opened for viewing\r\n    * S3 print method\r\n    * Do not attemt to open HTML files with `browseURL()` if\r\n    `getOption(\"browser\")` does not provide a default option\r\n\r\n## Internal changes\r\n\r\n* Dramatically increase speed of `wflow_status()`/`wflow_publish()` by using\r\n`git2r::odb_blobs()` to obtain past commit times of files (if these functions\r\nare stil slow for you, try running `git gc` in the Terminal)\r\n* Make workflowr compatible with latest release of [git2r][] as well as previous\r\nversions\r\n* Move rmarkdown from Depends to Imports. Unlike earlier versions, it's no\r\nlonger necessary to call rmarkdown functions directly when using workflowr\r\n(which was the original intention of attaching rmarkdown). Also there is the\r\npotential for problems to arise from the order in which packages are loaded in a\r\nuser's R session (described [here][leeper-depends])\r\n\r\n[leeper-depends]: https://github.com/leeper/Depends\r\n\r\n* Remove the fields `include`/`exclude` from the template `_site.yml`. Also\r\nremove the file `analysis/.nojekyll` (related to point above). Unlike\r\n`rmarkdown:::default_site`, `wflow_site()` does not copy the entire directory to\r\nthe output directory, so these fields have no effect. See the R Markdown\r\ndocumentation on [Included files][included-files] for more information\r\n\r\n[included-files]: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html#included-files\r\n\r\n*  Add GitHub Issue Templates (created by @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and improved error handling\r\n\r\n* Fix Windows-specific bug in `wflow_publish()`, `wflow_remove()`, and\r\n`wflow_git_commit()`. The bug prevented Windows users from running these\r\nfunctions from a subdirectory of a workflowr project\r\n\r\n* Restore all files in website directory if `wflow_publish()` fails to build any\r\nof the files (reported by @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n* If a user has not set the Git configuration variables `user.name` and\r\n`user.email`, any workflowr function that creates a Git commit will throw an\r\ninformative error message. Previously this was only done for `wflow_start()`,\r\nbut has been expanded to `wflow_git_commit()`, `wflow_publish()`, and\r\n`wflow_remove()` (idea from @pcarbo)\r\n\r\n* Ensure that `wflow_build()` creates a new `.nojekyll` file if necessary and\r\nthat `wflow_publish()` commits it. This is most useful when changing the name of\r\nthe output directory (#72)\r\n",

        "description": "This release changes the interface of some of the main workflowr functions. The \r\nfunctions `wflow_publish()` and `wflow_status()` are introduced, and the \r\nprevious functions `wflow_build()` and `wflow_commit()` are re-designed.\r\n\r\n## wflow_status\r\n\r\n* New function `wflow_status()` reports which analysis files require user\r\nattention (inspired by `git status`)\r\n\r\n* Defines R Markdown files whose HTML has been committed as part of the Git repo\r\nas \"Published\", R Markdown files which have been committed to the Git repo but \r\nnot their HTML as \"Unpublished\", and R Markdown files that are untracked by Git \r\nas \"Scratch\". Furthermore, previously published files that have been \r\nsubsequently edited are classified as \"Modified\". See the man page\r\n`?wflow_status` for more details.\r\n\r\n## wflow_publish\r\n\r\n* This new function replaces the previous functionality of `wflow_commit()`. The\r\nbasic interface is much simpler.\r\n\r\n* `wflow_publish(\"analysis/file.Rmd\")` will 1) commit `analysis/file.Rmd`, 2) \r\nbuild `analysis/file.Rmd` in its own separate R session with `set.seed(12345)`, \r\nand 3) commit `docs/file.html` and any generated figures. These 3 steps are\r\nreferred to as \"publishing a file\".\r\n\r\n* `wflow_publish(all = TRUE)` will publish all tracked analysis files, analogous\r\nto `git commit -a`.\r\n\r\n* To change the theme or make some other change to the entire site, run \r\n`wflow_publish(\"analysis/_site.yml\", republish = TRUE)`, which will 1) commit \r\nthe configuration file `analysis/_site.yml`, 2) re-build all the previously \r\npublished analysis files using the new configuration options, and 3) commit the \r\nre-built HTML files.\r\n\r\n## wflow_build\r\n\r\n* By default, `wflow_build()` runs in \"Make\"-mode, only building R Markdown \r\nfiles that have been updated more recently than their corresponding HTML files. \r\nIf instead files are specfically stated, those files will be built.\r\n\r\n* By default, R Markdown files are now built each in their own separate R \r\nsession (similar in function to the \"Knit HTML\" button in RStudio). This\r\nprevents undesirable behavior like sharing variables and loaded packages across\r\nseparate files. Set `local = TRUE` to build the files in the local R console\r\n(useful for debugging, but otherwise discouraged).\r\n\r\n* By default, the seed for random number generation is set to the arbitrary \r\nnumber `12345` (using `set.seed()`). This ensures that any code that produces \r\nrandom numbers will be reproducible.\r\n\r\n## wflow_commit\r\n\r\n* `wflow_commit()` has been demoted to only being a wrapper for the equivalent \r\nfunctionality of `git add` and `git commit`. This can be useful for committing \r\nnon-analysis files or R Markdown files that you aren't ready to publish yet. \r\nHowever, you should use `wflow_publish()` for the standard workflow.\r\n\r\n* Set `all = TRUE` to run the equivalent of `git commit -a`.\r\n\r\n## wflow_update\r\n\r\n* Improved documentation of `wflow_update()` to better explain its \r\nfunctionality. It will attempt to convert all R Markdown files present to use \r\nthe latest version of the workflowr R Markdown template; however, it will only \r\ncommit R Markdown files that are tracked by Git.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n* All workflowr functions should now accept the file extesion `.rmd` in addition\r\nto `.Rmd` (Issue #10)\r\n\r\n* Replaced the shared argument `path` with `project` to clarify that this\r\nargument specifies the path to a directory in the workflowr project\r\n\r\n* `wflow_start()` now includes `docs/.nojekyll`\r\n\r\n* Change dependency to R >= 3.2.5 (Issue #32)\r\n\r\n* Change stringr dependency (>= 1.1.0)\r\n\r\n* Started a vignette with Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n* Added sections to README (Quick start, Upgrading, Related work, and Citation)",

        "description": "## wflow_start\r\n\r\n* The `wflow_start()` API has been simplified. Now the first (and only required) argument is the directory to be created. By default, the name of the project will be determined from the directory name. For example, `wflow_start(\"~/projects/proj-x\")` will create a workflowr project with the name \"proj-x\". To specify a different name, provide the argument `name`\r\n* New argument `change_wd = TRUE` changes the working directory to the newly created project. \r\n* New argument `existing = FALSE` is a safety feature so that by default workflowr projects are only created in new directories\r\n* `wflow_start()` no longer adds \"BuildType: Website\" to RStudio project file.\r\nUsers should run `wflow_build()` instead. `wflow_update()` removes the build specification for existing workflowr projects\r\n* Fixed bugs related to relative paths and nested paths\r\n\r\n## workflowr R Markdown template\r\n\r\n* Updated workflowr R Markdown template can be built even if the user does not have workflowr installed\r\n* Use new function `wflow_convert()` to convert an R Markdown file based on the previous template to use the latest version\r\n* New optional \"standalone\" version of the workflowr template for creating files outside of a workflowr project (set `standalone = TRUE` for `wflow_open()`)\r\n* Can create a workflowr R Markdown file outside of a workflowr project by setting `path = NULL`\r\n\r\n## Migrating an existing project to use workflowr\r\n\r\n* New vignette on \"Migrating an existing project to use workflowr\"\r\n* `wflow_update()` function updates workflowr projects to use the latest version of the template\r\n* `wflow_convert()` converts an existing R Markdown file to use the workflowr template (can also update a file that uses a previous version of the template)\r\n\r\n## Other new functions\r\n\r\n* `wflow_view()` opens the website in the browser\r\n* `wflow_remotes()` manages remote Git repositories on GitHub.
