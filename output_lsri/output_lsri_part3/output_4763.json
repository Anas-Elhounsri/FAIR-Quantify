It is always placed at the beginning (left, N terminus) of the sequence.\n- `Cys1` First pair of cyclizes cysteines. Always in pair, never next to each other.\n- `Cys2` Second pair of cyclizes cysteines. They are always present in pair, never next to each other, present only if Cys1 is already part of the sequence.\n- `Cys3` Third pair of cyclizes cysteines. They are always present in pair, never next to each other, present only if Cys1 and Cys2 are already part of the sequence.\n- `Ac` N-terminus acetylation. It is always placed at the beginning (N-terminus, left) of the sequence\n- `NH2` C-terminus amide. It is always placed at the end (C-terminus, right) of the sequence \nBy default, all building blocks are used. Using the method `exclude_buildingblock(bb)` is possible to exclude all building blocks with the exception of the head to tail cyclization (cy) and the cyclized cysteines (Cys1, Cys2, Cys3), to exclude cyclization use \u201ctopology = linear\u201d.  \nBy default, PDGA stops after CBD = 0 from the query MXFP value is found 10 times. Using the method `ga.set_time_limit('hh:mm:ss')` is possible to stop PDGA after a chosen time. \nTo run the genetic algorithm with MXFP as fitness function, a valid Chemaxon licence is required and the specified libraries needs to be downloaded.\n \n"
