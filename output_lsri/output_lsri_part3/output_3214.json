We advice to use this new version of DEEPScreen to train target-specific models. Please note that this version is planned to be improved further by adding more functionalities. \n* DEEPScreen is a large-scale DTI prediction system, for early stage drug discovery, using deep convolutional neural networks\n* One of the main advantages of DEEPScreen is employing readily available 2-D structural representations of compounds at the input level instead of conventional descriptors that display limited performance\n* DEEPScreen learns complex features inherently from the 2-D representations, thus producing highly accurate predictions.\n* More information can be obtained from [DEEPScreen journal article](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9SC03414E). \n"
