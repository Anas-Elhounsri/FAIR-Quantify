It contains useful tools\nto normalize and clean the matrix, compute its spectral properties, and process it to obtain its essential component. It also provides plotting functions to\nobtain high quality pictures with minimal knowledge of the matplotlib library.\n\n- [essHIC.ess](https://github.com/stefanofranzini/essHIC/wiki/essHIC.ess): tool to compute a dataset-wide distance matrix between all couples of experiments using the essential metric distance.\n\n- [essHIC.dist](https://github.com/stefanofranzini/essHIC/wiki/essHIC.dist): a useful explorative tool to analyze distance matrices. It allows to perform hierarchical and spectral clustering on the dataset, to compute the ROC curves according to the cell-types provided in the metadata, and to perform multiscaling dimensional reduction (MDS). It also contains plotting tools to visualize\nthe results of all mentioned analyses.\n\nMore information is available on the package [wiki](https://github.com/stefanofranzini/essHIC/wiki).\n\n---\n"
