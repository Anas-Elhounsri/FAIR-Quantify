You can add its path to your `~/.bashrc` file under\nthe `PATH` variable to call it from anywhere; or you can run the following command to add it to your\ncurrent session:\n```\nuser@linux$ PATH=$PATH:$PWD/bin/\n```\n\nYou can also add `ktrim` to your system to call it from anywhere and share with other users (requires\nroot privilege):\n```\nuser@linux# make install\n```\n\nCall `ktrim` without any parameters to see the usage (or use '-h' option):\n```\nUsage: Ktrim [options] -f fq.list {-1/-U Read1.fq [-2 Read2.fq ]} -o out.prefix\n\nAuthor : Kun Sun (sunkun@szbl.ac.cn)\nVersion: 1.5.0 (May 2023)\n\nKtrim is designed to perform adapter- and quality-trimming of FASTQ files.\n\nCompulsory parameters:\n\n  -f fq.list      Specify the path to a file containing path to read 1/2 fastq files\n\nOR you can specify the fastq files directly:\n\n  -1/-U Read1.fq  Specify the path to the files containing read 1\n                  If your data is Paired-end, use '-1' and specify read 2 files using '-2' option\n                  Note that if '-U' is used, specification of '-2' is invalid\n                  If you have multiple files for your sample, use ',' to separate them\n                  Note that Gzip-compressed files (with .gz suffix) are also supported\n\n  -o out.prefix   Specify the prefix of the output files\n                  Note that output files include trimmed reads in FASTQ format and statistics\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n  -2 Read2.fq     Specify the path to the file containing read 2\n                  Use this parameter if your data is generated in paired-end mode\n                  If you have multiple files for your sample, use ',' to separate them\n                  and make sure that all the files are well paired in '-1' and '-2' options\n\n  -c              Write the trimming results to stdout (default: not set)\n                  Note that the interleaved fastq format will be used for paired-end data.\n  -t threads      Specify how many threads should be used (default: 4)\n                  You can set '-t' to 0 to use all threads (automatically detected)\n                  2-8 threads are recommended, as more threads would not benefit the performance\n\n  -p phred-base   Specify the baseline of the phred score (default: 33)\n  -q score        The minimum quality score to keep the cycle (default: 20)\n                  Note that 20 means 1% error rate, 30 means 0.1% error rate in Phred\n  -w window       Set the window size for quality check (default: 5)\n                  Ktrim will stop when all the bases in a consecutive window pass the quality threshold\n\n                  Phred 33 ('!') and Phred 64 ('@') are the most widely used scoring system\n                  while quality scores start from 35 ('#') in the FASTQ files is also common\n\n  -s size         Minimum read size to be kept after trimming (default: 36)\n\n  -k kit          Specify the sequencing kit to use built-in adapters\n                  Currently supports 'Illumina' (default), 'Nextera', 'Transposase' and 'BGI'\n  -a sequence     Specify the adapter sequence in read 1\n  -b sequence     Specify the adapter sequence in read 2\n                  If '-a' is set while '-b' is not, I will assume that read 1 and 2 use same adapter\n                  Note that '-k' option has a higher priority (when set, '-a'/'-b' will be ignored)\n\n  -m proportion   Set the proportion of mismatches allowed during index and sequence comparison\n                  Default: 0.125 (i.e., 1/8 of compared base pairs)\n\n  -h              Show this help information and quit\n  -v              Show the software version and quit\n\nPlease refer to README.md file for more information (e.g., setting adapters).\n\nKtrim: extra-fast and accurate adapter- and quality-trimmer.\n```\n\nPlease note that from version 1.2.0, Ktrim supports Gzip-compressed files as input. If you have multiple\nlanes of FASTQ files, Ktrim even supports that some lanes are compressed while others are in plain text, as\nlong as READ1 and READ2 are the same (either both compressed or plain text) for each lane of paired-end data.\n\n`Ktrim` contains built-in adapter sequences used by Illumina TruSeq kits, Nextera kits, Nextera transposase\nadapters and BGI sequencing kits within the package. However, customized adapter sequences are also allowed\nby setting '-a' (for read 1) and '-b' (for read 2; if it is the same as read 1, you can left it blank)\noptions. You may need to refer to the manual of your library preparation kit for the adapter sequences.\nNote that in the current version of `Ktrim`, only 1 pair of adapters is allowed.\n\nHere are the built-in adapter sequences (the copyright should belong to the corresponding companies):\n\n```\nIllumina TruSeq kits:\nAGATCGGAAGAGC (for both read 1 and read 2)\n\nNextera kits (suitable for ATAC-seq, Cut & tag data):\nCTGTCTCTTATACACATCT (for both read 1 and read 2)\n\nBGI adapters:\nRead 1: AAGTCGGAGGCCAAGCGGTC\nRead 2: AAGTCGGATCGTAGCCATGT\n```\n"
