Please cite the paper:**  \nSt\u00f6cker, Tyll, et al. \"MuWU: Mutant-seq library analysis and annotation.\" Bioinformatics (2021)  \n- DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab679](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab679)  \n- Link: [https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab679/6377773](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab679/6377773)   \n**Novel features MuWU v1.5:**  \nWith the release of MuWU v1.5 it is now possible to perform an **additional downstream analysis** with which **sub-types/ specific elements** of the detected insertions/TEs can be determined.  \nBasically, the user can supply a set of sequences which are specific to a specific subtype/element of the particular transposon in question.  \nFor this to work your input raw data reads have to contain this sequence - however the sequence can be cut/trimmed away during the MuWU run.  \nIn our (BonnMu) data we use a 12-fold degenerate TIR primer which is trimmed away before the alignment step.  \nBased on the subtype/element sequence association all matching reads are sorted into files for the specific subtype/element.  \nOnce the insertions are identified we associate them via their corresponding reads with all respective subtypes/elements.  \nSince in our work we face the additional difficulty that the TIR sequence of particular Mu element can very between the left and right end of the transposon, both a \"\\_L\" (left side) as well as a \"\\_R\" (right side) sequence can be supplied.  \nIf in your work this is not necessary or you only know one side, you can simply pass a pseudosequence for one of the pairs, so that the subtype/element is not counted double (example given in config.yaml).  \nSeveral output tables are produced summarizing the information, as well as extension tables: normal MuWU output + the typing information.  \n  \nInsertions which can't be associated with a supplied type (no read matching) are addtionaly investigated.  \nTheir reads are extracted and - based on a user supplied motif - clustered and their redundancy removed.  \nThis allows for the **detection of putative novel types or elements** that either were not considered by the user or sequencing steps.  \nFor further details & options see the config.yaml. \n"

With this default it would necessitate at least two reads that end & 2 reads which start with the overlap (TSD sequence at particular locus). \nUsing `extension`, upstream or downstream bases (equal to integer value) can be added to the gene models of the annotation to include UTRs, regulatory regions, promoter sequences etc.. This is helpful since insertions outside of gene models can otherwise not be annotated and thus allows for easier association of these regions with the gene at the particular locus. \n"

Snakemake will first pull the defined container image (docker://tgstoecker/muwu_v1.5), and then create the requested conda environment from within the container. Please note however, that the user has to make sure that singularity needs to be set up correctly and have all required permissions which - depending on the specific circumstances - can be tricky (especially if you don't have sudo rights).  \n  \nUsing the third option (without `--use-conda`) will expect all software to be readily available and in your $PATH.  \nThis is the intended command if you use the singuarity container - here the main software and test folder all have their respective environments **already installed**.  \nIf you omit this parameter snakemake/conda will try to download & install all required software which the container was specifically build for to already to contain.  \nOf course this is exactly the behaviour you want if you cloned MuWU here from github and want all the dependencies to be installed at runtime.  \n\n"
