The current version (v.2.0) of RELICS uses a Bayesian hierarchical model and considers the overlapping effects of multiple guides, can jointly analyze multiple pools per replicate, and estimates the number of functional sequences supported by the data. \nBriefly; RELICS splits the region of interest into segments. It then iteratively places one functional sequence at a time, while considering all previously placed functional sequences. RELICS is a semi-supervised method and takes a set of positive control sgRNAs as input. Note that RELICS currently does not use non-targeting sgRNAs and only analyzes one chromosome at a time. We are working on several extensions and if you have any requests, please feel free to reach out to us! \nThis work is continuously being improved. Please ask questions or [post issues](https://github.com/patfiaux/RELICS/issues).\n \n"

Set the output name of the analysis (`dataName`). Be sure to choose a different name from the existing file so that you don't overwrite the example, and you can compare and check that you got the same flags.\n\n```r\nrelics.parameters$dataName <- 'CD69_tutorial_analysis'\n```\n\n3. Specify the data file.\n\n```r\nrelics.parameters$DataInputFileLoc <- './Example_data/CD69_data_example.csv'\n```\n\n4. RELICS uses a Dirichlet-Multinomial and jointly analyzes all pools from each replicate. In the specification file the replicates are separated by a semicolon (`;`) and referred to by column position in the data file. Within R, the replicates are each an element within a `list()`\n\nExample: `5,7,9,11,13;6,8,10,12,14` represents two replicates. In this example, the pools of each replicate are altering.\n\nNote 1: The input type is a string, such as the example shown above.\n\nNote 2: Analysis across multiple replicates has not been implemented yet, so jointly analyzing all pools (`5,7,9,11,13,6,8,10,12,14`) is not advised!\n\n```r\nrepl.pools <- list()\nrepl.pools[[1]] <- c(5, 7, 9, 11, 13)\nrepl.pools[[2]] <- c(6, 8, 10, 12, 14)\n\nrelics.parameters$repl_groups <- repl.pools\n```\n\n5. The `label` column assigns each sgRNA to a category. These categories are used in the beginning to specify the training sets. By default a set of sgRNAs overlapping known functional sequences (FSs) have to be provided to the `FS0_label` flag. In this case these are guides overlapping the CD69 promoter. All other sgRNAs are used to train the background parameters. The counts of the sgRNAs overlapping each FS detected are iteratively added to the set of counts used to determine the Dirichlet parameters of the FS.\n\nAs an option, it is also possible to specify the sgRNA labels to be used as the background. This is done with the `background_label` flag.\n\nIn both cases the flags are given either as string or as vector of strings.\n\n```r\nrelics.parameters$FS0_label <- 'CD69_promoter' # use all sgRNAs that overlap the CD69 promoter are used to initially train the FS parameters\n\n# option: specify the background parameters\n# relics.parameters$background_label <- c('chr', 'exon') # specify what sgRNAs to use to initially train the background parameters\n```\n\n6. Specify the number of functional sequences to look for and the number of functional sequences you expect to find. RELICS will look for a total of `max_fs_nr` functional sequences and eight their signal according to the prior which is specified by the `expected_fs_nr`. We recommned setting the `max_fs_nr` to at least `expected_fs_nr` + 3. For larger `expected_fs_nr` we recommend setting `max_fs_nr` to 4/3*`expected_fs_nr`.\n```r\n# specify the expected number of functional sequences and how many to look for in total\nrelics.parameters$max_fs_nr <- 15\nrelics.parameters$expected_fs_nr <- 5 # expected based on previous findings by Simeonov et al., 2017 and Fiaux et al., 2020\n```\n\n7. Specify the CRISPR system used. Depending on the CRISPR system used, the area of effect (AoE) is different. By default RELICS assumes that the AoE follows a normal distribution.  For more details see section Area of Effect below.\n```r\nrelics.parameters$crisprSystem <- 'CRISPRa' # other options: CRISPRcas9, CRISPRi, dualCRISPR\n```\n\n8. Give the location of the output directory by setting the `out_dir` flag. Either reference to full path or the path from the current working directory. In this example we will do the latter and assume you are in the `RELICS_tutorial` folder. We recommend you create a new file in which the results are saved. Note, RELICS will NOT create non-existent files for you. In this example, first create the `CD69_tutorial_output` folder, then set the flag:\n```r\nrelics.parameters$out_dir <- 'CD69_tutorial_output'\n```\n\n9. RELICS now explicityl models the count-dispersion relationship. This drastically imporves performance and helps reduce the number of false positives. See the section `Count-Dispersion modeling` below for details on how to best estimate `nr_disp_bins` and `repl_spline_df`:\n```r\n# specify the number of bins to group the guide counts into and the degrees of freedom of the spline function for each replicate\nrelics.parameters$nr_disp_bins <- 15\nrelics.parameters$repl_spline_df <- list(repl_1 = 3, repl_2 = 3)\n```\n"

        "value": "RELICS explicitly models the relationship between guide counts and their dispersion (variance). It has been observed that the dispersion of biological count data changes with increasing count size (see Fig. 1 in [Love, Huber, Anders., 2014](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8)). We use a spline function to account for the wide range of possible count-dispersion relationships. To estimate the correct spline function we first sort and bin the guides according to their total per-replicate counts. Using differen degrees of freedom (number of points that a spline can use to fit to the data) we compute the the best fit for the number of bins followed by  calculating the dispersion for each individual guide. Based on the plotted output the best fit can then be used to the RELICS analysis.\n\nThe spline parameters have to be estimated for each replicate. While usually there isn't much difference between replicates we have observed cases where it's beneficial to use different degrees of freedom across different replciates.\n\nWe proivde a function to help users determine their correct settings. `spline_fitting` takes the same parameters as the main analysis function (`RELICS`) so you'll only have to set up the input list once. By default `spline_fitting` will return the fit to 3, 5, 10 and 15 degrees of freedom for a given bin size. We generally recommend bin sizes around 20 to 100. Increasing the number of bins can help in cases where some bins have very high counts.\n\nFirst, source the spline modling script and the RELICS code.\n```r\nsource('/path/to/script/estimate_spline_fitting.R')\nsource('/path/to/script/RELICS.v2.r')\n\n# if you moved into the RELICS_tutorial folder:\n# source('../Code/estimate_spline_fitting.R')\n```\n\n```\n# use the same parameter list used for the RELICS analysis\nanalysis.specs$nr_disp_bins <- 15 \nspline_fitting(input.parameter.list = analysis.specs, repl = 1) # plot the splie fits for replicate 1\n```\n\n![CD69 example spline fitting](RELICS_tutorial/Spline_fitting_example.png)\n\nIn the example above it seems having 3 degrees of freedom with 15 bins leads to the best result. The spline does not overfit to the data. In general, if two splines fit approximately equelly well it's better to pick the one with less degrees of freedom to avoid overfitting. Note that here we've plotted the 1/dispersion values. This helps with the resolution to choose the best fit. If you are interested in seeing what the final dispersion values look like you can set the `plot.true.disp` flag to `TRUE`.\n\n```\n# use the same parameter list used for the RELICS analysis\nspline_fitting(input.parameter.list = relics.parameters,repl = 1, plot.true.disp = TRUE)\n```\n\n![CD69 example spline fitting_trueDisp](RELICS_tutorial/Spline_fitting_example_trueDispersion.png)\n\n\nIt is also possible to disable the dispersion modeling. Set the mean-variance type to independent and disbale the disperison modeling.\n```\nrelics.parameters$mean_var_type <- 'independent'\nrelics.parameters$model_dispersion <- FALSE\n```\n\n"

It contains the information of chromosome, start and end location of the segment, as well as the label of the segment.\n\n|Column name | Column description |\n|----------|----------|\n| chrom | chromosome of the region |\n| start | region start |\n| end | region end |\n| label | highest overlapping label according to the [label hierarchy](https://github.com/patfiaux/RELICS#advanced-flags) |\n\n* `{dataName}_countsVSdispersion_repl`: The plot of the count-dispersion modeling. It is recommended to check these plots and make sure that the dispersion for each replicate has been well modeled.\n\n* `{dataName}_FS0_seg_llRt.bedgraph`: Bedgarph file of the log-likelihood ratio of each segment containing a functional sequence. This can be a helpfuls representation of the data as it can indicate the number of potential functional sequences. However, a high signal doe not necessarily mean RELICS will detect a functional sequence because the information used to generate this track is reduced and does not correspond to the full RELICS analysis. \n\n* `{dataName}_FS0_guideLLR.csv`: Contains the log-likeohood ration of each guide overlapping a functional sequence. This can be helpful when sleecting guides for validation.\n\nIn all subsequent file names, the pattern `_kX_` refers to `X` functional sequences detected.\n\n* `{dataName}_finalFS_kX_summaryStatPlots.bedgraph`: Plots of the model log-likelihood progression as more FS are detected as well as the per-FS contribution to the model. The top row is adjusted to account for the prior, the bottowm row contains the raw lieklihoods.\n\n* `{dataName}_final_kX_cs_pp.bedgraph`: This file contains the sum of the credible sets of posterior probabilities across all functional sequences detected.\n\n* `{dataName}_finalFS_kX_FS_locations.bed`: This file contains all genome segments part of the functional sequences detected.\n\n* `{dataName}_finalFS_kX_cs_pp.csv`: This file contains the credible set functional sequence probabilities of all functional sequences detected. Each column corresponds to a genome segment, ordered as in `{dataName}_segmentInfo.csv`. Each row corresponds to the functional sequence probabilities of a particular functional sequence. The first row corresponds to FS0, the second to FS1 etc.\n\n* `{dataName}_finalFS_kX_model_lls.csv`: This file contains the per-functional sequence log-likelihood contribution to the model improvement as well as the model lig-likelihood progression. The raw likelihoods are also given, which have not yet been weighted by the prior given for the number of FS.\n\n|Column name | Column description |\n|----------|----------|\n| FS | the functional sequence |\n| fs_ll_contrib | contribution of each FS to the model |\n| raw_fs_ll_contrib | raw contribution of each FS to the model |\n| model_ll | model log-likelihood progression |\n| raw_model_ll | raw model log-likelihood progression |\n| cs_raw_pp | sum of the credible set posterior probability |\n\n* `{dataName}_finalFS_kX_alphas.csv`: This file contains the dirichlet sorting parameters for the background (`alpha0`) and for functional sequences (`alpha1`) for all replicates.\n\n* `{dataName}_finalFS_kX_disp.csv`: This file contains the per-guide assigned dispersions.\n"
