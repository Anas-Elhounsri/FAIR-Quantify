It is the goal of experimental setup and fusion detection software to filter out those fusions that do not physically exist. \n  * Oncofuse reports, but does not account for fusion frame when calculating P-values. Is is done intentionally, as the fusion information often could be incomplete, e.g. there are cases when random nucleotides are added in fusion junction restoring the frame. So it is left up to the user to decide should he ignore out-of-frame fusions or not. \n* Note that since v1.0.9 there is an `-a hgXX` option, specifying genome assembly. It defaults to `hg19`, yet certain tools, for example FusionCatcher v0.99.3e provide output in `hg38` coordinates. \n* Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mikessh/oncofuse/issues) to report bugs and suggest new features. \n"
