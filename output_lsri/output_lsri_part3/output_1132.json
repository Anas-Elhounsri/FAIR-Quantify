The input dataset(s) contains mixed, heterogeous cells. _scGPS_ first uses _SCORE_ (or _CORE_ V2.0) to identify homogenous subpopulations. _scGPS_ contains a number of functions to verify the subpopulations identified by _SCORE_ (e.g. functions to compare with results from PCA, tSNE and the imputation method CIDR). _scGPS_ also has options to find gene markers that distinguish a subpopulation from the remaining cells and performs pathway enrichment analysis to annotate subpopulation. In the second stage, _scGPS_ applies a machine learning procedure to select optimal gene predictors and to build prediction models that can estimate between-subpopulation transition scores, which are the probability of cells from one subpopulation that can likely transition to the other subpopulation. \n<p align=\"center\">\n\t<img src=\"man/figures/packagePlan.png\" width=\"450px\"> <br>\nFigure 1. scGPS workflow.
