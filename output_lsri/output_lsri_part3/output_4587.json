Pick the first two sequences that have the highest scores. The progressive tree set is initialized as these first two sequences.\n2. For each remaining sequence, sum the scores between the remaining sequence and all the sequences from the current progressive tree set. Pick the one with the highest sum score, and push it to the progressive tree set.\n3.
