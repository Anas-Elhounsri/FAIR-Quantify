In our paper, we were interested in classifying hospitals as having high or low COVID-19 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers in Haiti. In the traditional form of LQAS, the sample size, _n_, and decision rule, _d_, are determined by the population size, _N_, and four parameters defined by users based on the specific context and goals. \n\nThe four parameters are: \n+ *p.upper* the upper prevalence threshold by which an area is classified as high\n+ *p.lower* the lower prevalence threshold by which an area is classified as low\n+ *alpha.constraint* the probability that a high area is mistakenly classified as low\n+ *beta.constraint* the probability that a low area is mistakenly classified as high\n\nAs our procedure also accounts for imperfect testing properties, we require that the *sensitivity* and *specificity* of the test is known to appropriately determine the LQAS system (_n_ and _d_).\n"
