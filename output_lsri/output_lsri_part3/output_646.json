        "value": "CARNIVAL (**CA**usal **R**easoning for **N**etwork identification using\n**I**nteger **VAL**ue programming) is a method for the identification of\nupstream reguatory signalling pathways from downstream gene expression\n(GEX). \nThis is a tool currently being developed by the\n[saezlab](http://saezlab.org/) members and is an extension of the\npreviously implemented Causal Reasoning ([*Melas et\nal.*](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ib/c4ib00294f))\nmethod. More detailed information on the CARNIVAL pipeline as well as\nbenchmarking and applicational studies are available on following paper. \nThe aim of the CARNIVAL pipeline is to identify a subset of interactions\nfrom a prior knowledge network that represent potential regulated\npathways linking known or potential targets of perturbation towards\nactive transcription factors derived from GEX data. The pipeline\nincludes a number improved functionalities comparing to the original\nversion and consists of the following processes: \n-   1.  Transcription factors\u2019 (TFs) activities and pathway scores from\n        gene expressions can be inferred with our in-house tools\n        DoRothEA & PROGENy, respectively. \n-   2.  TFs\u2019 activities and signed directed protein-protein interaction\n        networks with or without the provided target of perturbations\n        and pathway scores are then used to derive a series of linear\n        constraints to generate integer linear programming (ILP)\n        problems. \n-   3.  An ILP solver (IBM ILOG CPLEX) is subsequently applied to\n        identify the sub-network topology with minimised fitting error\n        and model size. \nApplications of CARNIVAL include the identification of drug\u2019s modes of\naction and of deregulated processes in diseases (even if the molecular\ntargets remain unknown) by deciphering the alterations of main\nsignalling pathways as well as alternative pathways and off-target\neffects. \n"
