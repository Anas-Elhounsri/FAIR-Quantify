It should be noted that a reported association predicted to have high power is not automatically accurate, as survival bias induced by multiple testing may inflate the reported OR and RAF estimates.\n\nStudies where reported associations show misalignment with the predicted powered curves may be further investigated for potential problems in the data curation process.

This allows us to bypass the disease models which define these two quantities implicitly. Indeed, when designing a study to replicate a reported finding, the core quantities RAF and OR are alaways available in GWAS catalogs, while disease models are often not reported in the literature. See <a href=\"https://power.stat.lsa.umich.edu/u-pass/U-PASS_documentation.html#a_model-invariant_parametrization\" target=\"_blank\">more arguments in the documentation</a> on why we prefer to specify these two quantities directly.\n\nType I error control criteria may be specified in terms of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family-wise_error_rate\" target=\"_blank\">family-wise error rate</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors\" target=\"_blank\">type I error</a>.\n\nTarget non-discovery rate may be specified in terms of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors\" target=\"_blank\">power / type II error</a>, or the more stringent family-wise non-discovery rate, i.e., the probablity of not detecting any one of the loci with equal or stronger signal.\n"
