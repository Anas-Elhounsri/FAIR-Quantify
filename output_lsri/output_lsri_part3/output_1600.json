        "value": "Genotype-to-phenotype studies continue to identify sets of genomic variants associated with diseases, e.g., through GWAS, cataloging of somatic mutations in cancer, or identification of de novo mutations from family-based studies. There is a pressing need to interpret these variants mechanistically, e.g., through characterization of molecular pathways impacted by them. Such insights are especially useful in studies of complex diseases where no single variant explains etiology. Here we present a computational tool called \u2018VarSAn\u2019 (Variant Set Analysis) that uses a powerful graph mining algorithm to identify pathways relevant to a given set of variants. VarSAn aggregates diverse information about the user-provided collection of variants, along with prior knowledge about genes and pathways, to provide systems-level insights into those variants. \n\nVarSAn uses a pre-built and configurable heterogeneous network whose nodes represent SNPs,  genes and pathways, and edges represent relationships among these entities. The network includes: (1) SNP-gene relationships based on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, protein activity impact prediction and genomic proximity, (2) gene-gene relationships based on known interactions among encoded proteins, and (3) gene-pathway membership. VarSAn then takes a \u201cquery set\u201d of variants and uses the Random Walk with Restarts algorithm on the network to rank pathway nodes for relevance to the query set, reporting p-values for pathway relevance. \n\n![Method Overview](images/VarSAn_method.png)\n\n \n[Return to TOC](#table-of-contents)\n"
