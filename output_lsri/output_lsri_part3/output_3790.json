This \nforked repo will be associated with that developer's GitHub account, and is distinct \nfrom the shared repo managed by the Monarch Initiative.\n\n##### Principle 2: Commit to personal branches of that fork\n* Changes will never be committed directly to the master branch on the shared repo. \nRather, they will be composed as branches within the developer's forked repo, where the \ndeveloper can iterate and refine their code prior to submitting it for review.\n\n##### Principle 3: Propose changes via pull request of personal branches\n*  Each set of changes will be developed as a task-specific *branch* in the developer's\nforked repo, and then a [pull request](github.com/government/best-practices/compare) \nwill be created to develop and propose changes to the shared repo. This mechanism \nprovides a way for developers to discuss, revise and ultimately merge changes from the \nforked repo into the shared Monarch repo.\n\n##### Principle 4: Delete or ignore stale branches, but don't recycle merged ones\n*  Once a pull request has been merged, the task-specific branch is no longer needed \nand may be deleted or ignored. It is bad practice to reuse an existing branch once it \nhas been merged. Instead, a subsequent branch and pull-request cycle should begin when \na developer switches to a different coding task. \n*  You may create a pull request in order to get feedback, but if you wish to continue \nworking on the branch, so state with \"DO NOT MERGE YET\".\n"
