The program outputs chimaeric sequences aligned to the host genome sequence in what has become a standard format. Typing breakalign.pl -help will show the options. \nSample command lines (note, always use hyphen not dash symbols and ensure no whitespaces in directory names) \n\nPrior to execution the following key steps are required. \n1. BreakAlign will check for a system blastn installation since this dependency is a strict prerequisite for the software to run; if not found, the user is warned and can provide a directory path where a local version of blastn is downloaded using either the -bp switch or inserting into the script at line 20 (if the version of blastn predates 2.2.31+ it should still run but we cannot guarantee that). \nBreakAlign can retrieve automatically a reference sequence spanning a putative integration site from an installed copy of the reference human genome. This genome must be downloaded from either the UCSC website (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/chromosomes/) or from the NCBI\u2013NIH genomes FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes). The downloads will contain chromosomes as individual FASTA file within a single folder (chr1.fa, chr2.fa, etc). To use this option the following are required. \n1. The Bioperl module SeqIO must be installed. \n2. Indicate the directory path where the host reference genome sequence is stored using the -fr switch (/path/to/reference_folder/). \n"
