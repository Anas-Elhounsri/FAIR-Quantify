Install [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/admin-guide/installation.html)\n2. Install [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation)\n3. Run:  `nextflow run ciccalab/SIMPLI -profile test`\n\nThis will run SIMPLI on minimal example dataset distributed in this repository.\nFor more details on the example dataset and the associated analysis workflow see the [example-workflow page](https://github.com/ciccalab/SIMPLI/wiki/Analysis).\n\nThe expected installation time on a desktop computer (Ubuntu 21.04) is of about 20 minutes. \nThe expected run time with the example run on a desktop computer (Ubuntu 21.04) is of about 45 minutes. \n\n## Citation\nIf you used SIMPLI for your analysis please cite our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.437886):\n\n**A SIMPLI (Single-cell Identification from MultiPLexed Images) approach for spatially-resolved tissue phenotyping at single-cell resolution**  \n*Michele Bortolomeazzi, Lucia Montorsi, Damjan Temelkovski, Mohamed Reda Keddar, Amelia Acha-Sagredo, Michael J.
