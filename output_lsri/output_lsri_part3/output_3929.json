        "value": "Regional **connectivity-based parcellation** (CBP) is a procedure for regional mapping by long-range connectivity\nprofiles (Eickhoff et al., 2015), revealing brain organization within a region-of-interest (ROI). \nFor a complete overview of the software and a setup guide, visit \n[documentation](https://cbptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \nThe procedure clusters ROI voxels/vertices based on similarity in their profile of connection strengths to a set of\ntarget voxels/vertices, referred to as a connectivity profile. The connectivity profile for each ROI voxel/vertex\nreflects that voxel/vertex's connectivity to a target space, for instance all gray matter voxels/vertices within the\nbrain for functional data. Voxels/vertices are clustered using the\n[k-means clustering](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) algorithm, which\nis optimized such that within-group similarity of profiles is high and between-group similarity is low. The resulting\nclusters form units of homogeneity within an ROI delineated by differences in connectivity, with the units being\nspatially consistent due to neighboring voxels/vertices having more similar patterns in connectivity than those further\naway. This provides the CBP procedure with the ability to map distinct brain regions, useful for localizing\n(dys)function or outlining functional or structural subdivisions/clusters within a particular ROI. Group results are\ngenerated by applying a [hierarchical clustering](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.hierarchy.html)\nalgorithm on the individual clustering results. Further processing options can configured by the user. \nThe type of connectivity depends crucially on the imaging modality, where connectivity means the patterns of anatomical\nlinks for structural data through diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and statistical dependencies for functional data.\nCBPtools currently supports two neuroimaging modalities: resting-state bloox-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) time-series\ntypically used to measure task-independent functional connectivity, and probabilistic diffusion tractography to\nestimate anatomical fiber-connectivity.\n \n"
