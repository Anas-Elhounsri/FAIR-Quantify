        "value": "scMLnet is an R package developed to construct inter-/intracellular multilayer singaling network based on single-cell RNA-seq expression data. scMLnet constructs the multilayer network by integrating intercellular pathways (ligand-receptor interactions) and intracellular subnetworks (receptor-TF pathways and TF-target gene interactions) based on cell-type specific gene expression, prior network information and statistical inference. scMLnet can also visualize the constructed inter-/intracellular signaling pathways between the central cell and neighboring cells. scMLnet is implemented using R\n(version 3.6.0) and Python (version 3.7).\n\n\n\nThe main steps of the scMLnet algorithm include:\n\n* **Step1 Constructing Ligand-Receptor subnetwork**: defines potential Ligand-Receptor subnetworks from scRNA-Seq data and Ligand-Receptor database by getting highly expressed genes (HEGs). HEGs in Type A (sender cells) are considered as potential ligands and HEGs in Type B (receiver cells) as potential receptors.\n* **Step2 Constructing TF-Target gene subnetwork**: defines potient TF-Target gene subnetworks from scRNA-Seq data and TF-Target gene database by getting HEG and Fisher\u2019s exact test. HEGs in Type B are considered as potential target genes. Activated TFs can be inferred from the TF-Target gene subnetwork.\n* **Step3 Constructing Receptor-TF subnetwork**: defines potient Receptor-TF subnetworks from activated TFs and Receptor-TF database by Fisher\u2019s exact test. Activated receptors can be inferred from the TF-Target gene subnetwork.\n* **Step4 constructing multi-layer signaling network**: defines multi-layer signaling network by performing correlation analysis between receptors and TFs, TFs and target genes and then overlapping the Ligand-Receptor, TF-Target gene, Receptor-TF subnetworks according to common receptors and TFs.\n\n![](./vignettes/illustration.png)\n"
