The process procedure remains the same as filter module. \n\n(Note: Input BAM/CRAM files should be sorted by readID when it contains Paired-End data.)\n\n**filterStLFR**: Preprocess stLFR FASTQ files, added with a barcode-detection step at the beginning, and support FASTQ files list as input. \n\n**filtersRNA**: Preprocess sRNA FASTQ files. Since it is still under testing, please inform us if you encounter any bug.\n\n**filterMeta**: Preprocess Meta FASTQ files. Since it is still under testing, please inform us if you encounter any bug.\n\n"
