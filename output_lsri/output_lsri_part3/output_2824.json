Note that the experimental frames are shown before and after the re-generated images for ease of visualization. Scale bar is 5 microns.\") \n\n2. Learning an optimized PSF for high density localization via end-to-end optimization. \n\n![](Figures/masklearninganimation.gif \"This movie shows the phase mask (left) and the corresponding PSF (right) being learned over training iterations. Note that the phase mask is initialized to zero modulation, meaning the standard microscope PSF. Scale bar is 2 microns.\") \n\nThere's no need to download any dataset as the code itself generates the training and the test sets. Demo 1 illustrates how to train a localization model based on a retreived phase mask, and demo 4 illustrates how the method can be sued to learn an optimzied phase mask. The remaining demos evaluates pre-trained models on both simulated and experimental data.\n \n"

The assumed physical setup parameters are given in the script `Demos/parameter_setting_demo1.py`. This script should be duplicated and altered according to the experimental setup as detailed in `Docs/demo1_documentation.pdf`.\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/data_utils.py` implements the positions and photons sampling, and defines the dataset classes.\n    * The folder `Mat_Files` includes phase masks needed to run the demos.\n* CNN models and loss function\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/cnn_utils.py` this script contains the two CNN models used in this work.\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/loss_utils.py` implements the loss function, and an approximation of the Jaccard index.\n* Training scripts\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/Training_Localization_Model.py` this script trains a localization model based on the pre-calculated training and validation examples in `GeneratingTrainingExamples.py`. Here, the phase mask is assumed to be fixed (either off-the-shelf or learned), and we're only interested in a dense localization model.\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/PSF_Learning.py` this script learns an optimized PSF. The training examples in this case are only simulated 3D locations and intensities.\n* Post-processing and evaluation\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/postprocessing_utils.py` implements 3D local maxima finding and CoG estimation with a fixed spherical diameter on GPU using max-pooling.\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/Testing_Localization_Model.py` evaluates a learned localization model on either simulated or experimental images. In demo2/demo5 this module is used with pre-trained weights to localize experimental data. In demo3 it is used to localize simulated data.\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/assessment_utils.py` - this script contains a function that calculates the Jaccard index and the RMSE in both the axial and lateral dimensions given two sets of points in 3D.\n* Visualization and saving/loading \n    * `DeepSTORM3D/vis_utils.py` includes plotting functions.\n    * `DeepSTORM3D/helper_utils.py` includes saving/loading functions.\n \n # Demo examples\n \n* There are 5 different demo scripts that demonstrate the use of this code:\n    1. `demo1.py` - learns a CNN for localizing high-density Tetrapods under STORM conditions. The script simulates training examples before learning starts. It takes approximately 30 hours to train a model from scratch on a Titan Xp.\n    2. `demo2.py` - evaluates a pre-trained CNN for localizing experimental Tetrapods (Fig. 3 main text). The script plots the input images with the localizations voerlaid as red crosses on top. The resulting localizations are saved in a csv file under the folder `Experimental_Data/Tetrapod_demo2/`. This demo takes about 1 minute on a Titan Xp.\n    3. `demo3.py` - evaluates a pre-trained CNN for localizing simulated Tetrapods (Fig. 4 main text). The script plots the simulated input and the regenerated image, and also compares the recovery with the GT positons in 3D. This demo takes about 1 second on a Titan Xp.\n    4. `demo4.py` - learns an optimized PSF from scratch. The learned phase mask and its corresponding PSF are plotted each 5 batches in the first 4 epochs, and afterwards only once each 50 batches. Learning takes approximately 30 hours to converge on a Titan Xp. \n    5. `demo5.py` - evaluates a pre-trained CNN for localizing an experimental snapshot of a U2OS cell nucleus with the learned PSF. The experimental image can be switched from 'frm1' to 'frm2' in `Experimental_Data/`. This demo takes about 1 second on a Titan Xp. \n* The `Demos` folder includes the following:\n    * `Results_Tetrapod_demo2` contains pre-trained model weights and training metrics needed to run demo2.\n    * `Results_Tetrapod_demo3` contains  pre-trained model weights and training metrics needed to run demo3.\n    * `Results_Learned_demo5` contains pre-trained model weights and training metrics needed to run demo5.\n    * `parameter_setting_demo*` contains the specified setup parameters for each of the demos. \n"
