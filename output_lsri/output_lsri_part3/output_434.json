Because this method was based on the 3D molecular structures. Therefore, \nthe actual use of this method should be conducted  on optimized molecules containing 3D coordinates, such as molecules \noptimized by MMFF force field, PM7 method and so on, and the inputs should  be a sdf file containing multiple molecules \nwith 3D coordinates. The input  example was deposited in `./inputs/3cl-min.sdf` or `./inputs/casp8-min.sdf`. For users \nwho want to train their own model using new datasets, we also show a model training example in the following. The \ncorresponding training data was deposited in `./training_data`. The label of training data can be assessed using the\nscript `./scripts/get_sdf_charge.py`.
