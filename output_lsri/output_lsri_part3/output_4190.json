Its predecessor, PyPLIF (https://github.com/radifar/pyplif), is a molecular interaction fingerprinting tool for the docking results of PLANTS, exclusively. Unlike its predecessor, PyPLIF HIPPOS speeds up the computational times by separating the reference generation and docking analysis. PyPLIF HIPPOS also offers more options compared to PyPLIF. PyPLIF HIPPOS for Linux is stored as the Supporting Information in this application note and can be accessed in GitHub (https://github.com/radifar/PyPLIF-HIPPOS). Additionally, we present here the application of the tool in a retrospective structure-based virtual screening campaign targeting neuraminidase.\"\nauthors: \n  -\n    affiliation: \"Faculty of Pharmacy, Sanata Dharma University\"\n    family-names: Istyastono\n    given-names: \"Enade Perdana\"\n    orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8344-5587\"\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Center for Molecular Modeling (molmod.org)\"\n    family-names: Radifar\n    given-names: Muhammad\n    orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9156-9478\"\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada\"\n    family-names: Yuniarti\n    given-names: Nunung\n    orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4500-6065\"\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Faculty of Biotechnology, Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia\"\n    family-names: Prasasty\n    given-names: \"Vivitri Dewi\"\n    orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2992-1247\"\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Sanata Dharma University\"\n    family-names: Mungkasi\n    given-names: Sudi\n    orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5319-9744\"\ncff-version: \"1.1.0\"\ndate-released: 2020-07-20\ndoi: \"10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00305\"\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it using these metadata.\"\nrepository-code: \"https://github.com/radifar/PyPLIF-HIPPOS\"\ntitle: \"PyPLIF-HIPPOS\"\nversion: \"0.1.2\"\n..."

        "value": "Welcome to PyPLIF-HIPPOS's project page. PyPLIF-HIPPOS is an upgraded version of [PyPLIF](https://github.com/radifar/pyplif/) (**Python-based Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprinting**), a tool for molecular docking post-analysis. It will translate the 3D coordinates of both ligand(s) (generated from docking simulation) and protein into a series of *interaction bitstring* (also known as *Interaction Fingerprint*) (see image below). **HIPPOS** (/\u02cchipo\u028az/) is a recursive acronym of **HIPPOS Is PyPLIF On Steroids**. From this point forward, PyPLIF-HIPPOS is simplified to HIPPOS. \nCompared to PyPLIF, HIPPOS is not only faster and able to generate more customized interaction bitstring, but also supports both [PLANTS](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/pharmazie-und-biochemie/pharmazie/pharmazeutische-chemie/pd-dr-t-exner/research/plants/) & [Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/)!
