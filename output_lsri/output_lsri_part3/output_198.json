Contributions\nfrom outside the group of project maintainers are strongly welcomed but the\nfinal decision as to whether commits are merged into the codebase rests with\nthe team of project maintainers.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an\nappointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a\nproject may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported by contacting the project team at 'fangliu.ustc@gmail.com'. The project team will\nreview and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems\nappropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain\nconfidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of\nspecific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good\nfaith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other\nmembers of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 1.4, available at\n[http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: http://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n"

It's usually a [good\n  idea](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/do-not-issue-pull-requests-from-your-master-branch/)\n  to make changes on a\n  [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)\n  with the branch name relating to the feature you are going to add.\n* When you are ready for others to examine and comment on your new feature,\n  navigate to your fork of autosolvate on GitHub and open a [pull\n  request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) (PR). Note that\n  after you launch a PR from one of your fork's branches, all\n  subsequent commits to that branch will be added to the open pull request\n  automatically.  Each commit added to the PR will be validated for\n  mergability, compilation and test suite compliance; the results of these tests\n  will be visible on the PR page.\n* If you're providing a new feature, you must add test cases and documentation.\n* When the code is ready to go, make sure you run the test suite using pytest.\n* When you're ready to be considered for merging, check the \"Ready to go\"\n  box on the PR page to let the autosolvate devs know that the changes are complete.\n  The code will not be merged until this box is checked, the continuous\n  integration returns checkmarks,\n  and multiple core developers give \"Approved\" reviews.\n\n# Additional Resources\n\n* [General GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/)\n* [PR best practices](http://codeinthehole.com/writing/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/)\n* [A guide to contributing to software packages](http://www.contribution-guide.org)\n* [Thinkful PR example](http://www.thinkful.com/learn/github-pull-request-tutorial/#Time-to-Submit-Your-First-PR)\n"
