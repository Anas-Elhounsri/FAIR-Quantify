In particular, a two-stage\n(TS) approach is implemented that takes account of the specific\nnature of scRNA-seq data by separately testing for differential\nproportions of zero gene expression (using a logistic regression model)\nand differences in non-zero gene expression (using the semi-parametric\n2-Wasserstein distance-based test) between two conditions. \nNote that as input for scRNA-seq analysis, `waddR` expects a table of pre-filtered and normalised count data. As filtering and normalisation are important steps that can have a profound impact in a scRNA-seq workflow (Cole et al., 2019), these should be tailored to the specific question of interest before applying `waddR`. `waddR` is applicable to data from any scRNA-seq platform (demonstrated in our paper for 10x Genomics and Fluidigm C1 Smart-Seq2) normalised using most common methods, such as those implemented in the `Seurat` (Butler et al., 2018) or `scran` (Lun et al., 2016) packages. Normalisation approaches that change the shape of the gene distributions (such as quantile normalisation) and gene-wise scaling or standardizing should be avoided when using `waddR`. \nSee `?wasserstein.sc` and `?testZeroes` for more details.\n \n"
