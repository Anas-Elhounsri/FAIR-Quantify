The script works only for Linux and needs that you have apt-get installed.\n\n**If you do not have SUDO privileges** :please go into the file VarGenius/LIB/install_all.sh and comment the section where sudo privileges are needed and indicated with : \"##COMMENT THIS SECTION IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUDO PRIVILEGES\"\n\nTo install *VarGenius* you have to create a folder to save all the files and folders produced during the analyses (vargenius_analyses) and a folder for the dependencies (bin). **The \"bin\" folder MUST be empty at the moment of the installation**.\nThen, you run the install.pl script from the *VarGenius* folder.\n\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n              frank@compaq2:~$ mkdir vargenius_analyses \n              frank@compaq2:~$ mkdir bin \n              frank@compaq2:~$ cd VarGenius \n              frank@compaq2:~$ perl install.pl \n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------\n              \n\n\nThis will ask to you the full path to the working folder you just created and to a bin folder for the programs. Then all the needed tools will be installed. Please wait for the installer to finish.\n\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n\t\tThis script will prepare vargenius.pl to work in your directory.\n\t\tAre you sure you want to enjoy this software?(y or n) y\n\t\tWrite an existing complete path where you want to play with vargenius.pl (/home/username/analyses): /home/francesco/vargenius_analyses/\n\t\tWrite an existing complete path where you want to install the programs (/home/username/bin/): /home/francesco/bin/\n\t\tInstalling dependencies with  /home/francesco/VarGenius/LIB/install_all.sh\n\n\t\t[.....DEPENDENCIES ARE BEING INSTALLED...]\n\n\t\t##############################PROGRAM LINKS #################################\n\t\tPlease use the following links for the programs into the configuration file:\n\t\tR_path = /home/francesco/R\n\t\tjava_path = /home/francesco/java\n\t\tfastqc_path = /home/francesco/bin/FastQC/fastqc\n\t\ttrimmomatic_path = /home/francesco/bin/Trimmomatic-0.36/trimmomatic-0.36.jar\n\t\tsamtools_path = /home/francesco/bin/samtools-1.8/samtools\n\t\tbwapath = /home/francesco/bin/bwa-0.7.17/bwa\n\t\tbedtools_path = /home/francesco/bin/bedtools2/bin/bedtools\n\t\tpicard_path = /home/francesco/bin/picard.jar\n\t\tgatk_path = /home/francesco/bin/\n\t\tYou will need to manually download Annovar and Spidex because they need a registration \n\t\tGATK4 was automatically download but we still reccomend to manually download GATK3.8\n\t\t##############################PROGRAM LINKS #################################\n\n\t\t[...]\n\n\t\tNow you can work with VarGenius from this folder!\n\t\tOnly the first time that you run VarGenius you must: \n\t\t1. Create the tables of the database \n\t\t2. Download the genes information \n\t\t3. Download the genome fasta and the datasets for GATK\n\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n\nAs you can see *VarGenius* installer gives you the paths where the programs are installed. Please keep this paths at hand to insert them later during the Tutorial.\n\n**Download GATK Annovar and Spidex**\n\n*VarGenius* can run either GATK4 and GATK3. GATK4 is stable and can be automatically downloaded by VarGenius.\nYet, some users still want to use GATK3. In this case it must be manually downloaded because previously GATK was not an open source.\nWe do not ensure the stability of GATK3 since we are updating now the tool only for the newer version.\n\nAnnovar and Spidex need user registration hence they cannot be automatically downloaded by *VarGenius*. Yet, the Annovar databases will be automatically downloaded and installed by *VarGenius*!\n\nDownload Annovar from the website: http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/download/\nand Spidex [HERE](http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/spidex_download_form.php). You need to fill the form and wait for the response from the administrator. \n\nOnce you finished with Annovar, see how to use the first time *VarGenius*  in the [TUTORIAL](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/VarGenius/blob/master/GUIDE/TUTORIAL.md)\n\nIf you could not install automatically the dependencies the following are some instructions to do it manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Manual installation of dependencies\n\nIf you are not confident with Parallel Architecture management or you do not have sudo privileges you should ask her/him for the installation of the following software and get their complete paths. Otherwise please refer to this manual installation guide.\n\nIt is very common on shared clusters that the mantainer provides the user with several known tools such as those used in VarGenius.  Usually with \"module av\" you can get a list of installed programs and with \"module show program/vers\" you can get the path in the system to the executable. You can of course use those by only indicating their paths into the user_config.txt file.\n\nYou need to use/install:\n \n  - PostgreSQL database (https://www.postgresql.org/)\n  - Perl: (tested with ver5.10) (http://www.perl.org/get.html) ;\n  - BioPerl: (tested with ver1.6) (http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl); \n  - R: (tested with ver3.2.3) (http://www.r-project.org/). \n  - Java: (tested with ver.1.8.0) \n\nThe following are the supplementary Perl and R modules. If they are not included in the default installation, install them manually.\n\n  - Supplementary Perl MODULES:\n    - Parallel::ForkManager.pm (http://search.cpan.org/~yanick/Parallel-ForkManager-1.19/lib/Parallel/ForkManager.pm)\n    - Excel::Writer::XLSX (http://search.cpan.org/~jmcnamara/Excel-Writer-XLSX/lib/Excel/Writer/XLSX.pm)\n    - Vcf.pm (http://search.cpan.org/~ajpage/Bio-Pipeline-Comparison-1.123050/lib/Vcf.pm) \n    - MDBD::Pg (https://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/T/TU/TURNSTEP/DBD-Pg-3.10.0.tar.gz)\n\n   You may want to use the following Linux commands to check if you already have these perl modules:\n\n\t- perl -MParallel::ForkManager -e 'print \"Module installed.\\n\";'\n\t- perl -MExcel::Writer::XLSX -e 'print \"Module installed.\\n\";'\n\t- perl -MVcf -e 'print \"Module installed.\\n\";'\n\t- perl -MDBD::Pg -e 'print \"Module installed.\\n\";'\n\n    To install them on a Debian derivate linux distribution use from a terminal: \n    - sudo apt-get install libparallel-forkmanager-perl \n    - sudo apt-get install libexcel-writer-xlsx-perl\n    - sudo apt-get install libVcf\n    - sudo apt-get install libdbd-pg-perl\n\n  *HINT: if you do not have system administrator permissions to install into the cluster you can download manually these packages. Put the needed .pm files into a directory that you choose (e.g. /home/perl_lib/) and add this path into the perl_lib_paths.txt file located into the VarGenius/CONFIGURATION folder. Later the install script will add the needed libraries into VarGenius.*\n\n  - R needed libraries:\n      - RPostgreSQL\n      - ggplot2\n      - reshape2\n      - ExomeDepth\n\n  Start an R session and use library(\"package\") to check if the libraries are installed.\n\nThen you have to download the programs that *VarGenius* uses: BWA, FastQC, Trimmomatic, TrimGalore, Picard, Samtools, GATK, bedtools, Annovar, Freebayes. The tested versions are in bracket. Different versions may not work with this *VarGenius* version.\nActually, *VarGenius* uses the full path to each of the software. Hence, it does not require installation of them. As described into the TUTORIAL page, you have to write their full paths into the configuration file.\n\nDownload them at: \n\n- BWA: https://github.com/lh3/bwa/archive/v0.7.17.tar.gz (ver. 0.7.17)\n- FastQC: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/fastqc_v0.11.7.zip (ver. 0.11.7)\n- Trimmomatic: http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/Trimmomatic-0.36.zip (ver. 0.36)\n- Picard tools: https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/download/2.18.2/picard.jar (ver. 2.18.2)\n- Samtools: https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/download/1.8/samtools-1.8.tar.bz2  (ver. 1.8)\n- GATK: https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/download/4.1.4.0/gatk-4.1.4.0.zip (gatk. 4.1.4.0)\n- bedtools: https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases/download/v2.25.0/bedtools-2.25.0.tar.gz (ver. 2.25)\n- Annovar: http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/download/ (ver. 2018Apr)\n- Freebayes: https://github.com/ekg/freebayes/releases/download/v1.3.1/freebayes-v1.3.1\n- XHMM: https://bitbucket.org/statgen/xhmm/get/cc14e528d909.zip\n\n*HINT: you may want to download the folders and put them all into a **bin** directory to avoid to have a puzzling situation with paths.*\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you get some error during the installation or the running of *VarGenius* please see the FAQ page of the user guide or ask on the google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/VarGenius\n"
