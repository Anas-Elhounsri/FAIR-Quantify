        "value": "In recent years there has been an explosion in Cytometry data analysis tools in the open source scientific community. This expansion is looking to soon replace traditional methods such as manual gating with sophisticated automated algorithms. \nAlthough exciting, most of the tools and frameworks on offer are implemented in the R programming language and offer little structure and data management for those that are new to cytometry bioinformatics. This is especially difficult for those with limited experience with R and Bioconductor. We offer an alternative solution implemented in Python, a beginner friendly language that prides itself on readable syntax. \nThe CytoPy framework offers an object orientated design built upon <a href=http://mongoengine.org/>mongoengine</a> for flexible database designs that can incorporate any project, no matter how complex. CytoPy's toolkit populates this database with common data structures to represent cell populations identified in your cytometry data, whilst being algorithm agnostic and encouraging the use and comparison of multiple techniques. \nFeatures we offer are: \n* Dynamic central document-based data repository\n* Autonomous gating with hyperparameter search and local normalisation to help with tricky batch effects\n* Global batch effect correction with the <a href=https://github.com/slowkow/harmonypy>Harmony algoritm</a>\n* Supervised classification supporting any classifier in the Scikit-Learn ecosystem\n* High dimensional clustering, including but not limited to FlowSOM and Phenograph\n* Feature extracting and selection techniques to summarise and interrogate your identified populations of interest\n* A range of utilities from sampling methods, common transformations (logicle, arcsine, hyperlog etc), and dimension reduction (including PHATE, UMAP, tSNE, PCA and KernelPCA) \nTo find out more and for installation instructions, please read our documentation at https://cytopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ \n"
