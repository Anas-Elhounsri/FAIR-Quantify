The main aim of the package\nis to avoid anything complicated-- the first version used in\n[GigaSOM](https://github.com/LCSB-BioCore/GigaSOM.jl) had just under 500 lines\nof relatively straightforward code (including the doc-comments). \nCompared to plain `Distributed` API, you get more straightforward data\nmanipulation primitives, some extra control over the precise place where code\nis executed, and a few high-level functions. These include a distributed\nversion of `mapreduce`, simpler work-alike of the\n[DistributedArrays](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/DistributedArrays.jl)\nfunctionality, and easy-to-use distributed dataset saving and loading. \nMost importantly, the main motivation behind the package is that the\ndistributed processing should be simple and accessible.\n \n"

        "original_header": "Brief how-to",
        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "The package provides a few very basic primitives that lightly wrap the\n`Distributed` package functions `remotecall` and `fetch`. The most basic one is\n`save_at`, which takes a worker ID, variable name and variable content, and\nsaves the content to the variable on the selected worker. `get_from` works the\nsame way, but takes the data back from the worker. \nYou can thus send some random array to a few distributed workers:\n```julia\njulia> using Distributed, DistributedData\n\njulia> addprocs(2)\n2-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 2\n 3\n\njulia> @everywhere using DistributedData\n\njulia> save_at(2, :x, randn(10,10))\nFuture(2, 1, 4, nothing)\n```\nThe `Future` returned from `save_at` is the normal Julia future from\n`Distributed`, you can even `fetch` it to wait until the operation is really\ndone on the other side. Fetching the data is done the same way:\n```julia\njulia> get_from(2,:x)\nFuture(2, 1, 15, nothing)\n\njulia> get_val_from(2,:x) # auto-fetch()ing variant\n10\u00d710 Array{Float64,2}:\n -0.850788    0.946637     1.78006   \u2026 \n -0.49596     0.497829    -2.03013\n   \u2026\n```\nAll commands support full quoting, which allows you to easily distinguish\nbetween code parts that are executed locally and remotely:\n```julia\njulia> save_at(3, :x, randn(1000,1000))     # generates a matrix locally and sends it to the remote worker\n\njulia> save_at(3, :x, :(randn(1000,1000)))  # generates a matrix right on the remote worker and saves it there\n\njulia> get_val_from(3, :x)                  # retrieves the generated matrix and fetches it\n\u2026\n\njulia> get_val_from(3, :(randn(1000,1000))) # generates the matrix on the worker and fetches the data\n\u2026\n```\n \nNotably, this is different from the approach taken by `DistributedArrays` and\nsimilar packages -- all data manipulation is explicit, and any data type is\nsupported as long as it can be moved among workers by the `Distributed`\npackage. This helps with various highly non-array-ish data, such as large text\ncorpora and graphs. \nThere are various goodies for easy work with matrix-style data, namely\nscattering, gathering and running distributed algorithms:\n```julia\njulia> x = randn(1000,3)\n1000\u00d73 Array{Float64,2}:\n -0.992481   0.551064     1.67424\n -0.751304  -0.845055     0.105311\n -0.712687   0.165619    -0.469055\n  \u22ee\n\njulia> dataset = scatter_array(:myDataset, x, workers())  # sends slices of the array to workers\nDinfo(:myDataset, [2, 3])   # a helper for holding the variable name and the used workers together\n\njulia> get_val_from(3, :(size(myDataset)))\n(500, 3)    # there's really only half of the data\n\njulia> dmapreduce(dataset, sum, +) # MapReduce-style sum of all data\n-51.64369103751014\n\njulia> dstat(dataset, [1,2,3]) # get means and sdevs in individual columns\n([-0.030724038974465212, 0.007300925745200863, -0.028220577808245786],\n [0.9917470012495775, 0.9975120525455358, 1.000243845434252])\n\njulia> dmedian(dataset, [1,2,3]) # distributed iterative median in columns\n3-element Array{Float64,1}:\n  0.004742259615849834\n  0.039043266340824986\n -0.05367799062404967\n\njulia> dtransform(dataset, x -> 2 .^ x) # exponentiate all data (medians should now be around 1)\nDinfo(:myDataset, [2, 3])\n\njulia> gather_array(dataset) # download the data from workers to a sing\n1000\u00d73 Array{Float64,2}:\n 0.502613  1.46517   3.1915\n 0.594066  0.55669   1.07573\n 0.610183  1.12165   0.722438\n  \u22ee\n```\n \n"
