Besides, a new rule-interestingness measure Lamda3 is embeded in OmicsARules, it can be used to evaluate the association rules and identify biologically significant patterns. Association rule mining and visualizing were implemented in R environment using package arules and ggplot2.\n"

OmicsARules provides five cutoff values to discretize the continuous values into binary matrix, namely mean, median, P25 (the upper quartile), P75 (the lower quartile) and del-outliers (mean after deleting outliers). OmicsARules calculates one of these cutoff values (according to the user's choice) in each column, and if the values in each gene of a particular sample larger than the cutoff value, this value would be transformed into 1, otherwise 0. \n \n"

We start with the set of association rules: R = { a1 , c1 , m1 , . . . ai , ci , mi , . . . an , cn , mn }, where ai is the gene or gene set on the LHS, ci is the gene on the RHS and mi is the selected interest measure (default: lamda3) for the i-th rule for i = 1, . . . , n. Consequently, a L \u00d7 K matrix M in R with one column for each unique antecedent and one row for each unique consequent was identified and created.
