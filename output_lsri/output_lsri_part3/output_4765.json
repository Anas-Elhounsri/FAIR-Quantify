Quality control `(run_qc.sh)`**: <p style='text-align: justify;'> This scripts is running series of steps with different tools to perform quality control. [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC/) is used to generate comprehensive report of data quality on raw data. Followed by this is a series of steps including removal of adapters, low quality reads, sequencing artifacts, phix adapters and host contamination is performed using trimmomatic, sickle and bbmap.  \n**NOTE:** Its very important to review the QC result and change the parameters in the script based e.g read length and read quality etc. </p>\n\n**2. Metagenomic Single Sample Assembly `(run_assembly.sh)`**: <p style='text-align: justify;'>In this step genomes from more than one species with nonuniform coverage are de novo assembled in order to characterize these metagenomes. Three assemblers (Megahit,SPAdes and IDBA) are integrated in this step. After the assembly, assembly stats is generated for user to decide which assembler worked best on their data. After the stats, assembly filter is performed to filter contigs with minimum 1000bp length. </p>\n\n**3. Metagenomic Coassembly `(run_coassembly.sh)`**: <p style='text-align: justify;'> This step is similar to step 2. except that here the samples are assembled in group with Megahit and SPAdes. </p>\n\n**4. Reference based analysis `(run_reference_analysis.sh)`:** <p style='text-align: justify;'>The use of reference based is bit complicated due to the fact that here we are dealing not with single genome but to the unknown number and distribution. There way to deal with this by using all the available prokaryotic genomes and align them to the reads or use marker gene approach. In this step, different state of art tools like kraken2 and metaphlan2, Diamond, Megan and Humann2 are used to classify the output reads from quality control step. Diamond blastx is performed against NR database and meganized using megan databases. This output can be visualized on megan6 software for different options. Also, humann2 which is a reference based pipeline itself for taxonomic and functional classification has also been integrated in this script. </p>\n\n**5. Comparative analysis `(run_comparative_analysis)`**: <p style='text-align: justify;'>\nThe assembled filtered contigs are then  annotated by finding the genes and perform taxonomic and functional annotation using kraken, diamond, megan and prokka. Wide range of ways are available to perform this , here were are using PROKKA which used open source tools and databased for profiling. Prokka annotate the contigs by predicting genes using Prodigal and then perform functional annotation on these genes. For homology search prokka uses CDD, PFAM, TIGRAM databases on prodigal translated protein output.</p>\n\n**6. Coverage and binning `(run_coverage_and_bining)`**: <p style='text-align: justify;'> In this script contigs frm spade assembler are used for further analysis (due to good assmebly stats) but user can change this in `run_coverage_and_bining` script in \"ref\" variable. </br>\nThe indexed contigs sequences are backmapped on its own reads to create sam and bam file using BBMAP. The generated bam file can be used in IGV/IGB viewer for checking the alignment statistics. Depth file is generated from sorted bam file, which is then used for binning. The two binning tools used are Metabat and Maxbin. Along with known species, binning attempt to recover uncultivated microbial populations which might be paying an important role in a particular sample.</p>\n\n**7. Bin refinement `(run_binrefinement.sh)`**: <p style='text-align: justify;'> Different binning tools lead to different and uncertain binning results. This could be due to different algorithm behind these tools. In this step we are using two programs Binning_refiner and CheckM. Binning_refiner merges the results of different binning programs and significantly reduce the contamination level of genome bins and increase the total size of contamination-free and good-quality genome bins. CheckM, provides a set of tools for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from metagenomes. CheckM also provides tools for identifying genome bins that are likely candidates for merging based on marker set compatibility, similarity in genomic characteristics, and proximity within a reference genome tree.</p>\n\n**8. Bin taxonomic classification `(run_bin_taxonomic_classification.sh)`**: To assign taxonomic labels to the bins Kraken2 is used.</p>\n\n**9. Bin functional classification `(run_bin_functional_classification.sh)`**:\nBin are functionally annotated using prokka. Refer to point 6 for database detail.\n\n"

There are two workflows provided. First workflow for amplicon, using the standard mothur and dada2, and along with it some standard visualization are provided for the processed data. Second workflow for metagenomics, using a variety of tools openly available which have been stitched together to form a usable pipeline.</p> \nBoth the workflows are controlled by bash scripts: `amplicon_analysis.sh` and `metagenomics_analysis.sh`. The bash scripts contain functions which call the respective underlying tools. Of-course, the tools have to exist in the system before using them, hence, a function called as `check_and_install` is written into each script which checks if the tools exists in a certain path or not.</br>\nSince the workflows utilize so many different tools, it requires quiet a bit of patience for the download and installation process.

On the other hand, ASV based tool utilizes a denoising approach on biological sequences in samples before the introduction of amplification and sequencing errors.
