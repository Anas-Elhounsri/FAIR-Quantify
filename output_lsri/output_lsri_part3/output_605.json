Following is the list of required information specified in the JSON file with explanations: \n- <strong>Draft_genome</strong>: Path to the gapped draft genome to fill.\n- <strong>Bowtie2</strong>: Path to the bowtie2 executables. If you use the bowtie2 version inside the folder, then put \"bowtie2-2.2.3\", otherwise if it is in system path, then put \u201c\u201d here. In case you want to use your preferred version, put that path of installed directory in this input.\n- <strong>Output_Folder</strong>: Path to the directory where all the outputs will be stored. A folder named Figbird will be created in that directory where all the output will be stored. \n- <strong>Reference_Genome[optional]</strong>: Only needed if you want to evaluate the quality of the filled assembly using QUAST.\n- <strong>Read_Pairs</strong>: Input your paired read libraries one by one along with all the following information:\n\t\n\t1. <strong>path_1</strong>: Path to first of the read pair files.\n \t2. <strong>path_2</strong>: Path to second of the read pair files.\n\t3. <strong>avg_insert_size</strong>: Average insert size of the read pair library(<5000).\n\t4. <strong>is_reverse</strong>: If your read pair files are already in forward-reverse(FR) orientation then put 0, otherwise put 1. In case a 1 is given, we will reverse complement both the files of the the input read pair.\n\t5. <strong>max_read_len</strong>: Maximum read length of the library(<=200).\n\t6. <strong>serial_num</strong>: The order of reads usage for filling gaps.\n\t7. <strong>num_itr_partial</strong>: We will use both one end partially aligned and one end unmapped reads for each read pair for gap filling purpose. Enter the itration count for partial approach here.\n\t8. <strong>num_itr_unmapped</strong>: Enter the itration count for unmapped approach here.\n\t9. <strong>order</strong>: Put the order for Which one between partial and unmapped method will be applied first.\n\t\n\t* [Users must input atleast one library of read pair files and all 9 required information per library to start gap filling] \n\t\n- <strong>Parameters</strong>: \n\t1. <strong>numthreads</strong>: Number of threads used during bowtie2 alignment and gap filling procedure.[Default:4]\n\t2. <strong>evaluation</strong>: Put 1 if you want to assess with QUAST or 0 otherwise.[Default:0]\n\t3. <strong>gaplen_negative_overlap</strong>: We have allowed negative gap lengths in our method i.e a gap can be diminished if the corresponding left and right flank has an overlap with supporting verification of aligned reads. Enter the maximum length of the gaps for which this method will be applicable.[Default: 30]\n\t4. <strong>default</strong>: If you want to manually input the order of the reads usage along with their number of iterations, put 0. Otherwise, put 1 for default approach. If you put 1, then information [6-9] for read pairs won't be needed to specify.[Default:1]\n\t5. <strong>trim_len</strong>: The amount of nucleotides being chopped off from either side of the gapped regions as this is the stopping point for the assemblers and highly likely to contain erroneous sequence.[Deafult:10]\n\t6. <strong>set_inputmean</strong>: It can be set to either 0 or 1. Users can set this parameter to 1 to set the minimum scaffold length equal to the \u201cavg_insert_size\u201d of the read library to reduce bias towards shorter insert sizes during alignment for learning distributions. Otherwise, set it to 0 for no limits.[Deafult:0]\n\t \n"

If you don't have bc in your system, run the following command:\n```\nsudo apt install bc\n```\n- A command line JSON processor library <strong>'jq'</strong>. You can install jq from the following github page https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\n- [Optional] <strong>Python</strong> is required only if you want to assess the quality of filled gaps using <strong>QUAST</strong> software.
