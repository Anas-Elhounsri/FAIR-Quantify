They were then modified to use command line arguments.\n    \nThe descriptions are all from the [Delila Documentation](https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/software.html) and it is highly recommended users consult that website for complete information.\n    \n> DELILA stands for DEoxyribnucleaic-acid LIbrary LAnguage.\n> \n> It is a language for extracting DNA fragments from a large collection of sequences,\n> invented around 1980 (T. D. Schneider, G. D. Stormo, J. S. Haemer, and L. Gold, A\n> design for computer nucleic-acid sequence storage, retrieval and manipulation, \n> Nucl. Acids Res., 10: 3013-3024, 1982). The idea is that there is a large database\n> containing all the sequences one would like, which we call a `library'. \n> \n> One would like a particular subset of these sequences, so one writes up some \n> instructions and gives them to the librarian, Delila, which returns a 'book' \n> containing just the sequences one wants for a particular analysis. So 'Delila' \n> also stands for the program that does the extraction (delila.p). Since it is \n> easier to manipulate Delila instructions than to edit DNA sequences, one makes\n> fewer mistakes in generating one's data set for analysis, and they are trivial\n> to correct. Also, a number of programs create instructions, which provides a \n> powerful means of sequence manipulation. One of Delila's strengths is that it\n> can handle any continuous coordinate system. The 'Delila system' refers to a \n> set of programs that use these sequence subsets for molecular information \n> theory analysis of binding sites and proteins. In the spring of 1999 Delila \n> became capable of making sequence mutations, which can be displayed graphically\n> along with sequence walkers on a lister map. A complete definition for the\n> language is available https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/libdef.html, although not\n> all of it is implemented. There are also tutorials on building Delila libraries\n> and using Delila instructions. \n> \n> Delila is a modular set of programs which produce results that feed into the next\n> program.  It is highly configurable using parameter files.  The delila programs\n> used are listed below with general descripbtions.\n> \nDelila programs used to make logo (descriptions from the [Delila Documentation](https://alum.mit.edu/www/toms/software.html))\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> dbbk: \n> Convert GenBank flat file format to Delila format, which is called a `book'\n> (db = database, bk = book). This produces an 'l1' file which contains the book.\n> (l1 is a lower case L [standing for 'Library'] followed by the symbol 'one').\n> \n> catal: \n> Catalogue the contents of a book, usually l1. If you are not using them\n> (which is generally the case) make empty l2, l3 and catalp files, then run catal.\n> This will produce six files: lib1, lib2, lib3 and cat1, cat2, cat3. These make \n> up the library used by Delila in the next step.\n> \n> delila:\n> Extract fragments of sequences from a library of sequences and create \n> a subset, a book. This is the core of the Delila system. You give Delila \n> instructions (inst file) and those are used to create the subset desired. \n> For a logo, generally one makes instructions that look like this:\n> \n> get from 5600 -200 to same +200 direction +;\n> \n> This means to get 200 bases before position 5600 to 200 bases afterwards, \n> for a total of 401 bases. I recommend that you use a wide range like this to\n> be able to see the background noise around the binding site. By the way, the \n> number 5600 becomes the zero coordinate of the binding site. I try to pick a\n> position that is strongly conserved (high information content). \n> \n> malign: \n> Given a book of aligned sequences, this program searches for the alignment\n> of the sequences that has the lowest uncertainty, i.e. the highest value of\n> Rsequence. The user specifies the \"window\" of bases within which\n> uncertainty is calculated, and the maximum number of bases that each\n> sequence is allowed to shift from the original alignment.  The program\n> considers each sequence in turn, shifting it to an alignment with minimum\n> uncertainty while holding the other sequences fixed.  A \"pass\" is complete\n> when all sequences have been considered.  A \"run\" is complete when no\n> alignments have changed in the preceding pass, and the alignment is then\n> considered \"optimal\".  The first run starts with the original alignment;\n> every run after that starts with a \"shuffled\" alignment obtained by shifting\n> each sequence independently by a random amount between the allowed limits.\n> The program maintains a list of all of the unique optimal alignments\n> achieved from these starting alignments, and it outputs them in order of\n> increasing uncertainty.\n> \n> malin:\n> This program allows one to select one of the alignments created by malign\n> and to make the corresponding Delila instructions.  Because it copies the\n> inst file it keeps the organism and chromosome information (along with all\n> comments) so it is better than the \"bestinst\" file created by malign!\n> \n> alist:\n> Make an aligned listing of sequences using the Delila instructions \n> and the book created by Delila. The pair of the book and inst file is a set\n> called an 'aligned book'. I create a listing of the sequences to be sure \n> that they are aligned correctly. If this works, making the logo is fast\n> and a piece of cake.  Even if you have a large range defined in the delila\n> instructions, you can use a smaller one for the aligned listing. Note that\n> running this program does not affect the inst or book files, so can't\n> affect later steps. The program is controled by a file `alistp', which \n> stands for alist-parameters. \n> \n> encode:\n> Convert the book/inst into 0 and 1's. This is historically the way\n> we did it, but it is fast so we still do it this way. The output is encseq,\n> which is a bit large. To save space, you can delete the encseq file after\n> running the next program. Note that the range can be reduced in the\n> parameter file, so I normally set this to -200 to 200.\n> \n> comp:\n> Comp counts the number of each oligonucleotide (from length 1 to\n> compmax) in the book and prints that to file \"cmp\".  The output is\n> printed in order of increasing length of oligonucleotide (i.e., first\n> the monos, then the dis, ...).  If there are no occurences of an\n> oligonucleotide, but its one-shorter parent did occur, it will be given\n> a zero.  None of its descendants will be printed in the composition\n> file.\n> \n> rseq:\n> Compute Rsequence for each position in the aligned book, make an rsdata file.\n> \n> dalvec:\n> Convert the rsdata file into a symvec file, which the next program\n> can use to make the logo.\n> \n> ri:\n> The program determines the individual informations of the sites in the book\n> as aligned by the instructions, according to the frequency table given in\n> the rsdata file.  The program calculates the Ri(b,l) table:\n> \n> Ri(b,l) := 2 - (- log2( f(b,l)))\n> \n> and sums this up for each sequence.  Ri is defined so that the average of\n> the Ri's for a set of sequences is Rsequence.\n> \n> makelogo:\n> Finally! Make the sequence logo!\n> \nSteps of Delila-PY when running the `delila_pipeline.py` script\n------ \n1. dbbk    -- convert genbank file into a delila book\n1. catal   -- create catalogue and library files\n1. delila  -- extract a subset of sequences to examine, store in a book\n1. malign  -- alignment of the sequences that has the lowest uncertainty\n1. malin   -- select malign's best alignment\n1. delila  -- create a new book from best alignment (from malign)\n1. alist   -- make an aligned listing of sequences\n1. encode  -- convert the book/inst into 0 and 1's\n1. comp    -- counts the number of each oligonucleotide\n1. rseq    -- compute Rsequence\n1. dalvec  -- convert the rsdata file into a symvec file\n1. ri      -- calculate site information\n1. make initial logo -- for comparison to the final logo\n1. filter  -- remove sites that ri identified as <= 0 information\n1. repeat steps 3 through 11 with filtered sites\n1. make final logo \n     \n"

glbrc/delila:latest\n        docker.io/glbrc/delila:latest \n  NOTE CONCERNING THE USE OF SUDO: \n  If you don't want to use sudo everytime you run a Docker command, follow the instructions here:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n  Note this has sercurity implications, you should be aware of:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface                           \n3) List Docker images to make sure Delila-PY was downloaded using the following command: \n        sudo docker images\n        glbrc/delila \n        REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\n        glbrc/delila        latest              90845438bd28        6 days ago          620MB\n        hello-world         latest              bf756fb1ae65        12 months ago       13.3kB \n4) It's highly recommended that you first run the Delila-PY using the provided example files to ensure everything is working correctly.\n    \n    In the terminal, type the following command to make it possible to share data between the Docker environment and your local computer: \n        sudo docker run -dit -P --name delila -v /home/user/test/delila/container-data:/opt/delila/example/container-data  glbrc/delila\n           \n    -dit is `d` for detached mode,  `it` makes bash available in a pseudo terminal. \n    -P reports ports to the host.\n    \n    \u2013name give the container a name, (Optional)\n    \n    -v attach a volume for sharing data with host system \n    The first directory path (prior to the \":\") is the directory path on your local computer, where you can your Delila-PY input files (see below), they will be visible in the Docker container and can be used.\n    \n    In this example this path is:\n                \n        \"/home/user/test/delila/container-data\"\n        \n    if this doesn't exit it will be created. \n    Also note that this path may need to be changed to match the file system on your local computer.\n                \n    The second directory path (after the \":\") is working directory within the Docker container. \n    \n    In this example the path is:    \n    After running the `sudo docker run` above command you should see a container ID written in the terminal.\n    \n    It will look something like the following (the actual digits and letters may be different): \n    You can check that the container is running using the following command: \n        sudo docker ps -a \n        CONTAINER ID     IMAGE         COMMAND     CREATED          STATUS         PORTS   NAMES\n        22d098e7b4ca   glbrc/delila   \"/bin/bash\"  42 seconds ago   Up 41 seconds          delila \n    To run Delila-PY, you must first access the container by typing at least the first 4 characters of the Container ID using the following command: \n        sudo docker attach 22d098\n        \n    Alternatively, you can use the following command and indicate the name of the image: \n        sudo docker attach delila\n        \n    You will see a new command line prompt in your Terminal that should look similar to this (the digits and letters may be different): \n        bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib32  lib64  libx32  media  mnt  opt .... \n    Navigate to the folder you created above using the following command: \n        cd /opt/delila/example/containter-data\n        \n    Finally, we can run Delila using the example files using the following command: \n        python3 /opt/delila/delila_pipeline.py -g opt/delila/example/Rsphaeroides_GenBank.gbff -s opt/delila/example/Location_File_Example.txt  -l -10 -r +10 -t \"Example Logo\"\n    \n    This will produce the following files & directories within the `container-data` directory within the Docker image: \n        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-initial.logo \n        delila_pipeline.log\n        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1_PWM.txt\n        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-FINAL.logo\n        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-initial.logo.pdf\n        R.sphaeroides-2.4.1-FINAL.logo.pdf\n        directories:\n        parameters/\n        other/\n        instructions/\n        books/\n   \n    You can then exit the Docker image command line using the `exit` command. \n    This will then copy all the contents from the `/opt/delila/example/container-data` directory to your local computer directory `/home/user/test/delila/container-data` where you can view the resulting logo that was created.\n    \n    You can restart the same Delila-PY Docker image using the following commands: \n       sudo docker start delila\n       sudo docker attach delila \n5) Once you have verified that the Delila-PY runs successfully with the included example files, you can run Delila-PY with your own files  \n    Create a working directory (`mywork` in this example) for your data on the local system using the following command:\n        \n        mkdir mywork \n    Then you can copy the input files into the newly created mywork either in the GUI or with `mv` command in the Terminal \n    Once coppied, you can start the Delila-PY container using detached mode as above using the following commands: \n        sudo docker run -dit -P --name delila -v /mywork:/opt/delila/test/mywork glbrc/delila \n    The path before the `:` is the path to the mywork directory on your local computer and the path after the `:` is the path to where the directory will be created within the Delila-PY Docker image. \n        sudo docker attach delila \n    Finally, you can run the Delila-PY \n        cd /opt/delila/test/mywork\n        python3 /opt/delila/delila_pipeline.py -g opt/delila/mywork/GenBank.gbff -s opt/delila/mywork/Location_File.txt  -l -10 -r +10 -t \"Logo Title\" \n"
