Associations with a block of SNPs represented by their genotypes. \neQTLHap is implemented in R and it depends on matrices operations to calculate correlation coefficients. It adapts the ultra-fast Matrix eQTL (http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/Matrix_eQTL/) to deal with blocks and to maintain high speed.\n \n"
