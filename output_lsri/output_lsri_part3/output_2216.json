It was originally written to\n  annotate fungal genomes (small eukaryotes ~ 30 Mb\n  genomes), but has evolved over time to accomodate larger\n  genomes. The impetus for this software package was to be\n  able to accurately and easily annotate a genome for\n  submission to NCBI GenBank. \nkeywords:\n  - bioinformatics\n  - genome annotation\n  - genomics\n  - gene prediction\nlicense: BSD-2-Clause\nversion: 1.8.16\ndate-released: '2023-08-22'\n"

        "description": "Code has been repackaged to conform to a \"proper\" python package -- which means it now also resides on PyPi and a Bioconda package can be built.  Along with the repackaging there are many improvements/fixes.\r\n\r\n* funannotate now keeps track of \"trained species\" for all of the ab-initio gene predictors (Augustus, gene mark (optional), snap, GlimmerHMM, codingquarry).  This requires all users to update their database, ie `funannotate setup` command.  After running `funannotate predict` the software will output a JSON file containing the paths to the trained parameter files -- this can be used again for a different genome via the `funannotate predict --parameters` options.  This parameter file can also be added to the database with the `funannotate species -s genus_species -a parameters.json` command. Running the `funannotate species` command will output a table in the command line of which species have training data. Addressed #320 \r\n*  antiSMASH remote script fixed and parser updated for v5 output. \r\n* added filtering for gene models that start/end in a gap that can sometimes show up after running `funannotate update`\r\n* added a check for `diamond` version of the database and current copy -- this results in many hidden errors by users, ie diamond databases were created with an older/incompatible version than what is running currently.  \r\n* updated `Augustus` functional check\r\n* removed `RepeatModeler/RepeatMasker` as strict dependencies.  Due to RepBase change in usage license, repeatmasker/modeler are not available to most users. The `funannotate mask` command can still run this routine if you have the necessary dependencies installed, however, the current default is simply to run `tantan` masking.  This is probably not sufficient for most genomes, thus happy to integrate a robust solution once one exists for repeat masking.\r\n* augustus parameter training now done in the local output folder, so no longer need write access to $AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH\r\n",

Reason for this switch is to allow more flexibility in how the assembly is soft masked -- this can be done externally with another program. This change will allow users that don't have access to RepBase to use an alternative from RepeatMasker/RepeatModeler. One alternative is RED -- I wrote a wrapper for called [RedMask](https://github.com/nextgenusfs/redmask)\r\n* `funannotate predict` can now run without GeneMark being installed -- again to accommodate users that may be unable to use GeneMark due to licensing. Note you can pass gene predictions from any external program to `--other_gff` and they will be handed off to Evidence Modeler. \r\n* spaces in either strain or isolate name will be stripped #180 \r\n* default program for `funannotate clean` changed to minimap2 #176 \r\n* fix errors in partial gene models derived from using EVM script to generate proteins, this is now done internally using exact coordinates #184\r\n* added `--soft_mask` option to `funannotate predict` which will control the option with same name in GeneMark, i.e. default is `--soft_mask 5000` which means that repeat regions less than 5 kb will be ignored for GeneMark prediction, those greater than 5 kb will be fed to Genemark. #185 \r\n* bug fixes for `tbl` file generation. all tRNA models will be partial #184 \r\n* improvement to how data from `funannotate train` is used in prediction steps\r\n* Slight changes for clarity to `funannotate predict` flags for evidence alignments:\r\n```\r\n--protein_evidence       Proteins to map to genome (prot1.fa prot2.fa uniprot.fa).

        "description": "* v1.2.0 now supports multiple transcripts per gene locus.  The funannotate pipeline will only generate multiple transcripts per locus if given evidence in the form of RNA-seq data, this is done in the `funannotate update` command. It should also now support input with multiple transcripts as well.  \r\n* move installation of busco models to `funannotate setup`\r\n* added annotation edit distance (AED) to `funannotate update` to record the changes in annotation. As well the PASA annotation update text file is changed to incorporate these changes as well\r\n* accessory script `util/compare2annotations.py` can compare multiple annotations in either GFF3 or GBK format to a reference, generating summary stats as well as individual gene stats (AED per mRNA and CDS)\r\n* added a `--drop` option to `funannotate fix` that you can remove unwanted gene model annotations, to use pass a file containing locus_tag (1 per line) to the `--drop` parameter\r\n* fix bug in finding high-quality Augustus predictions (HiQ) models in `funannotate predict`\r\n* `funannotate predict` will now detect if a `training` folder exists in output directory, if it does it will find the correct PASA, BAM, and Trinity output and use automatically during the prediction step.\r\n",

        "description": "* fix for braker to work on docker. For some reason (I don't know why) the symlinks that braker tries to create cause an error when run on docker.  The error references too many levels of symlinks essentially. To circumvent this, I modified `braker.pl` code to copy instead of symlink.  Also fixed the `braker.pl --version` option which was broke in most recent release. \r\n* Note for a \"normal\" system, v1.1.0 should work fine.  The updated braker code was run on both docker and Mac native and runs fine on those, hopefully also working well on linux.",

        "description": "* bumping version to 1.1.0 to highlight that v1.0.X versions have a bug in the tbl annotation file and will not pass GenBank specs.  This was derived from dropping GAG from funannotate I had the tbl spec wrong for adding transcript_id and protein_id to both CDS and mRNA features.\r\n* fixes for `funannotate update` and properly filtering overlapping genes\r\n* fix for `funannotate annotate` that was switching the 5' and 3' partial gene designations on crick orientated gene models, causing them to look correct after predict step and then become errors after annotate step\r\n* added Braker 2.0.3 to funannotate.... this was necessary as `braker.pl --version` doesn't display the version number so I can't enforce a version requirement. The larger issue has to do with how the different versions of braker save the output data, there are at least 3 different behaviors in the last 4 or 5 versions which makes impossible for funannotate to determine where output will be. \r\n",

        "value": "You can use docker to run `funannotate`. Caveats are that GeneMark is not included in the docker image (see licensing below and you can complain to the developers for making it difficult to distribute/use). I've also written a bash script that can run the docker image and auto-detect/include the proper user/volume bindings.  This docker image is built off of the latest code in master, so it will be ahead of the tagged releases. The image includes the required databases as well, if you want just funannotate without the databases then that is located on docker hub as well `nextgenusfs/funannotate-slim`. So this route can be achieved with:\n\n```\n# download/pull the image from docker hub\n$ docker pull nextgenusfs/funannotate\n\n# download bash wrapper script (optional)\n$ wget -O funannotate-docker https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate/master/funannotate-docker\n\n# might need to make this executable on your system\n$ chmod +x /path/to/funannotate-docker\n\n# assuming it is in your PATH, now you can run this script as if it were the funannotate executable script\n$ funannotate-docker test -t predict --cpus 12\n```\n"
