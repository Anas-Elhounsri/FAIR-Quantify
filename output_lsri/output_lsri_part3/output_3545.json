        "value": "MaRe has been developed with scientific application in mind. High-throughput methods produced massive datasets in the past decades, and using frameworks like [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) and [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) is a natural choice to enable high-throughput analysis. In scientific applications, many tools are highly optimized to resemble, or detect some phenomena that occur in a certain system. Hence, sometimes the effort of reimplementing scientific tools in Spark or Hadoop can't be sustained by research groups. MaRe aims to provide the means to run existing serial tools in MapReduce fashion. Since many of the available scientific tools are trivially parallelizable, [MapReduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html) is an excellent paradigm that can be used to parallelize the computation. \nScientific tools often have many dependencies and, generally speaking, it's difficult for the system administrator to maintain   software, which may be installed on each node of the cluster, in multiple version. Therefore, instead of running commands straight on the compute nodes, MaRe starts a user-provided [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image that wraps a specific tool and all of its dependencies, and it runs the command inside the Docker container. The data goes from Spark through the Docker container, and back to Spark after being processed, via Unix files. If the `TMPDIR` environment variable in the worker nodes points to a [tmpfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs) very little overhead should occur. \n \n"

Counting how many times `g` and `c` occur in a genome is a task that is often performed in genomics. In this example we use MaRe to perform this task in parallel with POSIX commands. \n\n```scala\nval rdd = sc.textFile(\"genome.txt\")\nval res = new MaRe(rdd)\n  .map(\n    inputMountPoint = TextFile(\"/dna\"),\n    outputMountPoint = TextFile(\"/count\"),\n    imageName = \"busybox:1\",\n    command = \"grep -o '[gc]' /dna | wc -l > /count\")\n  .reduce(\n    inputMountPoint = TextFile(\"/counts\"),\n    outputMountPoint = TextFile(\"/sum\"),\n    imageName = \"busybox:1\",\n    command = \"awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}' /counts > /sum\")\n  .rdd.collect()(0)\nprintln(s\"The GC count is: $res\")\n```\n\nIn the previous example we work with single text file (`genome.txt`), which is splitted line by line and partitioned through the executors. MaRe also supports working with multiple text or binary files. The following example does the GC count from a set of gzipped DNA strings. \n\n```scala\nval rdd = sc.binaryFiles(\"genome_*.gz\")\n  .map { case (path, data) => (path, data.toArray) }\nval res = new MaRe(rdd)\n  .map(\n    inputMountPoint = BinaryFiles(\"/zipped\"),\n    outputMountPoint = WholeTextFiles(\"/counts\"),\n    imageName = \"busybox:1\",\n    command =\n      \"\"\"\n      for filename in /zipped/*; do\n        out=$(basename \"${filename}\" .gz)\n        gunzip -c $filename | grep -o '[gc]' /dna | wc -l > /counts/${out}.sum\n      done\n      \"\"\")\n  .reduce(\n    inputMountPoint = WholeTextFiles(\"/counts\"),\n    outputMountPoint = WholeTextFiles(\"/sum\"),\n    imageName = \"busybox:1\",\n    command = \"awk '{s+=$1} END {print s}' /counts/*.sum > /sum/${RANDOM}.sum\")\n  .rdd.collect()(0)\nprintln(s\"The GC count is: $res\")\n```\n"
