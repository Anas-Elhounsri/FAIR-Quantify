The snplist has columns for Chromosome, Feature ID, Position, Allele 1, Allele 2, and Risk Allele.  \nThe `.raw` and `.bim` files can be produced from other formats using [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/). PLINK can also be used to filter SNPs within selected regions (exons, transcripts, or genes) as well as filter SNPs based on their allele frequencies.  \nFor example, we used the following PLINK v1.9 command to filter and format genotype data for human chromosome 21:\n```\n/plink \\\n  --gen gensim_chr21_100k.controls.gen.gz \\\n  --sample gensim_chr21_100k.sample \\\n  --maf 0.01 \\\n  --extract range <BED file containing exon positions for chr21> \\\n  --allow-no-sex \\\n  --snps-only \\\n  --recode A \\\n  --oxford-single-chr 21 \\\n  --out genotype\n  \n/plink \\\n  --gen gensim_chr21_100k.controls.gen.gz \\\n  --sample gensim_chr21_100k.sample \\\n  --maf 0.01 \\\n  --extract range <BED file containing exon positions for chr21> \\\n  --allow-no-sex \\\n  --snps-only \\\n  --oxford-single-chr 21 \\\n  --make-just-bim \\\n  --out full_snplist\n    \n```\nResulting in the creation of\n \n    /GWAS/data/genotype.raw: a Person X SNP Genotype Matrix\n    /GWAS/data/full_snplist.bim: Meta data for each SNP \n"
