Provides options to specify voxel size, select image quality (preview, half, full resolution), define an ROI for import, load every Nth slice (skip slice), or reverse stack order (to deal with mirroring of the specimen).\n- [**SkyscanReconImport:** ](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/SkyscanReconImport) Imports an image stack from Bruker/Skyscan reconstruction software (Nrecon) with correct voxel spacing and orientation as a 3D volume. User just needs to point out to the *_Rec.log* file that is outputted by the Nrecon software. Also possible to process multiple scans through the batch conversion interface (requires all reconstructions to be under a single directory tree)\n- [**GEVolImport:** ](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/GEVolImport) Utility to import the .VOL files generated by the GE/tome microCT scanners by parsing the associated reconstruction file (.PCR).\n- [**MorphoSourceImport:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/MorphoSourceImport) A utility to query and download open-access data from MorphoSource. An important distinction from the web based search of MorphoSource, queries primarily on keywords (e.g., Skull, femur or M2) which can be alternatively constrained by taxonomy. Requires an API key from MorphoSource to be able to download datasets.\n"

        "value": "- [**GPA:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/GPA) Performs Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) with conducts principle component analysis (PCA) of GPA aligned shape coordinates, provides graphical output of GPA results and real-time 3D visualization of PC warps either using the landmarks of mean shape, or using a reference model that is transformed into the mean shape. Visualization of 3D shape deformation of the reference model can be exported as video clips. The input into the module is a folder path containing a number of landmark files stored in Slicer\u2019s fcsv format and optionally a 3D model and accompanying set of landmarks to be used as reference model in 3D visualization of PCA results.\n- [**CreateSemiLMPatches:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/CreateSemiLMPatches) Provides triangular patches of semi-landmarks that are constrained by three fixed anatomical landmarks. The input into the module is a 3D model and its accompanying set of fixed landmarks, and users generate and visualize the patches by specifying triplets of fixed landmarks that form a triangle.\n- [**PseudoLMGenerator:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/PseudoLMGenerator) This module uses the 3D model\u2019s geometry to create a dense template of pseudo-landmarks. The landmark placement is constrained to the external surface of the mesh. Points sampled on the template are projected to the mesh surface along the surface normals of the template and then filtered to remove those within the sample spacing distance, improving regularity of sampling. This module can be used to generate a large number of points on a 3D model that can serve as a landmark template for additional samples in the dataset.\n- [**ALPACA:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/ALPACA) Automated Landmarking through Pointcloud Alignment and Correspondence Analysis. ALPACA provides fast landmark transfer from a 3D model and its associated landmark set to target 3D model(s) through pointcloud alignment and deformable model registration. Unlike the two semi-landmarking methods above, it does not require presence of fixed landmarks. Optimal set of parameters that gives the best correspondence can be investigated (and outcome can be visualized) in single alignment mode, and then applied to a number of 3D models in batch mode. Invoked first time, ALPACA needs your permission to download necessary libraries. Depending on the internet speed, download may take sometime but it is a one-time event.\n- [**MarkupEditor:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/MarkupEditor) A plugin that enables to select and edit subsets of dense semi-landmarks by drawing an arbitrary closedcurve in the 3D viewer using right-click context menus in 3D viewer. Selected landmarks can be removed from the current node or copied into a new fiducial node. Useful to quickly identify and remove outliers from spherical sampling procedure, or group landmarks into anatomical regions for downstream analyses.\n- [**PlaceLandmarkGrid:**]() Allows user to place a grid of semi landmarks that were constrained by 4 landmarks. Once placed, user can adjust the placement of the grid, and then resample semi-landmarks from them (WIP). Multiple grids can be created and then merged via the MergeMarkups module.\n\n"

Supports interpolation of regions of interests, rotations, and transfer functions for volume rendering. Output can be either as an image sequence of frames or can be compiled into mp4 format.\n- [**PlaceSemiLMPatches:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/PlaceSemiLMPatches) A utility to apply the generated connectivity table from the **CreateSemiLMPatches** module to other 3D models with the same set of anatomical landmarks. A new set of semiLandmarks are sampled directly from the new models using the specified connectivity map. Inputs: The connectivity table from CreateSemiLMPatches, a directory with the list of 3D models that semi-landmarks will be placed on, and associated anatomical landmark files (in fcsv format). Both model and its corresponding fcsv file should have the same filename prefix.\n- [**ProjectSemiLM:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/ProjectSemiLM) A utility to transfer a template of semilandmarks to new 3D models using Thin Plate Splines (TPS) warp. Requires existence a set of corresponding anatomical landmarks in the template and target models. Inputs: a base 3D model with its anatomical landmark and the semi-landmark template sets used as reference; a directory with the list of 3D models that semi-landmarks will be projected on and their associated anatomical landmark files (in fcsv format). Both model and its corresponding fcsv file should have the same filename prefix.\n- [**MergeMarkups:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/MergeMarkups). A utility to tag and consolidate fixed and semiLM files into a single merged file.\n- [**MorphologikaLMConverter:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/MorphologikaLMConverter) Imports a Morphologika formatted landmark file that may contain multiple subjects and exports a Slicer .FCSV landmark file for each individual to a directory specified by the user.\n- [**IDAVLMConverter:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/IDAVLMConverter) Imports IDAV landmark editor files with header length specified by the user.\n- **ImportSurfaceToSegment:** Imports a 3D surface model as a segmentation and prompts the user to edit it using the Segment Editor module.\n- **SegmentEndoCranium:** Automatically segments the endocranial space in a 3D volume of a vertebrate skull. A detailed description of the module and how it works can be found [in this tutorial under the automated method](https://slicermorph.github.io/Endocast_creation.html).\n- [**SlicerMorph Preferences:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/MorphPreferences/) Users can choose to enable specific customizations that include keyboard shortcuts, and optimized settings for working with large 3D datasets using the Application Settings menu of 3D Slicer. See the documentation link for list of SlicerMorph specific keyboard shortcuts and modified settings.\n- [**FastModelAlign:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/FastModelAlign) Allows users to register a 3D model (source) to a target. Support scaling, rigid and affine transforms.\n- [**QuickAlign:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/QuickAlign/README.md) Allows users to approximately align two objects in two different 3D viewers, and then link the views. Useful to compare models, landmarks and volume that were scanned in different orientations.\n- [**HiResScreenCapture:**](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/HiResScreenCapture/readme.md) Allows the user to create high-resolution off-screen rendering of what's visible in the 3D viewer. Useful to create high-DPI rendering for posters and publications. (Only available for Slicer 5.7 or later).\n"
