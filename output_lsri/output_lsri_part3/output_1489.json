These Terms and Conditions mirror\nthe GNU General Public License (Version 3, 29 June 2007), but also\nincorporate additional indemnification requirements set forth in Section\n18. Downloading and/or using this Program signifies your acknowledgement\nand agreement to the following:\n\nDefinitions\n\n\u201cCopyright\u201d also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\u201cThe Program\u201d refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.\nEach licensee is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cLicensees\u201d and \u201crecipients\u201d may be \nindividuals or organizations.\n\nTo \u201cmodify\u201d a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in\na fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a \u201cmodified version\u201d of the\nearlier work or a work \u201cbased on\u201d the earlier work.\n\nA \u201ccovered work\u201d means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\nthe Program.\n\nTo \u201cpropagate\u201d a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement\nunder applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or\nmodifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution\n(with or without modification), making available to the public, and in\nsome countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \u201cconvey\u201d a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \u201cAppropriate Legal Notices\u201d to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature\nthat (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user\nthat there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that\nwarranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this\nLicense, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents\na list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in\nthe list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code\n\nThe \u201csource code\u201d for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. \u201cObject code\u201d means any non-source form of a\nwork.\n\nA \u201cStandard Interface\u201d means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is\nwidely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \u201cSystem Libraries\u201d of an executable work include anything, other than\nthe work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging\na Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b)\nserves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to\nimplement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to\nthe public in source code form. A \u201cMajor Component\u201d, in this context, means\na major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the\nspecific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a\ncompiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to\nrun it.\n\nThe \u201cCorresponding Source\u201d for a work in object code form means all the\nsource code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run\nthe object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those\nactivities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or\ngeneral-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used\nunmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the\nwork. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition\nfiles associated with source files for the work, and the source code for\nshared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is\nspecifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication\nor control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you\nmust do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control,\non terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted\nmaterial outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; Section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure\nunder any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the\nWIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws\nprohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the\ncovered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive\nit, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all\nnotices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in\naccord with Section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the\nabsence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and\nyou may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of\nSection 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na)\tThe work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,\n    and giving a relevant date.\nb)\tThe work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released\n    under this License and any conditions added under Section 7. This\n    requirement modifies the requirement in Section 4 to \u201ckeep intact\n    all notices\u201d.\nc)\tYou must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to\n    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will\n    therefore apply, along with any applicable Section 7 additional terms,\n    to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they\n    are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in\n    any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n    separately received it.\nd)\tIf the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work\n    need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works,\nwhich are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which\nare not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a\nvolume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if\nthe compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the\naccess or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the\nindividual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does\nnot cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nSections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\na)\tConvey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily\n    used for software interchange.\nb)\tConvey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written\n    offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you\n    offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give\n    anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the\n    Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is\n    covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily\n    used for software interchange, for a price no more than your\n    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,\n    or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server\n    at no charge.\nc)\tConvey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written\n    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed\n    only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the\n    object code with such an offer, in accord with Sub-section 6b.\nd)\tConvey the object code by offering access from a designated place\n    (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that\n    supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear\n    directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne)\tConvey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you\n    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of\n    the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under\n    Sub-section 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from\nthe Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in\nconveying the object code work.\n\nA \u201cUser Product\u201d is either (1) a \u201cconsumer product\u201d, which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or\nhousehold purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \u201cnormally used\u201d refers to a typical\nor common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the\nparticular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses,\nor expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer\nproduct regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,\nindustrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only\nsignificant mode of use of the product.\n\n\u201cInstallation Information\u201d for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this Section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part\nof a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User\nProduct is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term\n(regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding\nSource conveyed under this Section must be accompanied by the Installation\nInformation. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any\nthird party retains the ability to install modified object code on the\nUser Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in\naccord with this Section must be in a format that is publicly documented\n(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form),\nand must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or\ncopying.\n\n7. Additional Terms\n\n\u201cAdditional permissions\u201d are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be\ntreated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that\nthey are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only\nto part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those\npermissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License\nwithout regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove\nany additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.\n(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in\ncertain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional\npermissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you\nhave or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add\nto a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that\nmaterial) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na)\tDisclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms\n    of Sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb)\tRequiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\n    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices\n    displayed by works containing it; or\nc)\tProhibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd)\tLimiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\ne)\tDeclining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade\n    names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf)\tRequiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material\n    by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with\n    contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any\n    liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \u201cfurther\nrestrictions\u201d within the meaning of Section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,\nyou may remove that term. If a license document contains a further\nrestriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you\nmay add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license\ndocument, provided that the further restriction does not survive such\nrelicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this Section, you must\nplace, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms\nthat apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the\napplicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form\nof a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above\nrequirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify\nit is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph\nof Section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless\nand until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your\nlicense, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you\nof the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the\ncessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\npermanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some\nreasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of\nviolation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and\nyou cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this Section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this\nLicense. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under Section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a\ncopy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring\nsolely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a\ncopy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than\nthis License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered\nwork. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.\nTherefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your\nacceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives\na license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that\nwork, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing\ncompliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \u201centity transaction\u201d is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work\nresults from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who\nreceives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\nthe party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous\nparagraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the\nwork from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can\nget it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights\ngranted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a\nlicense fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under\nthis License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim\nor counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed\nby making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or\nany portion of it.\n\n11. Patents\n\nA \u201ccontributor\u201d is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work\nthus licensed is called the contributor's \u201ccontributor version\u201d.\n\nA contributor's \u201cessential patent claims\u201d are all patent claims owned or\ncontrolled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter\nacquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this\nLicense, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not\ninclude claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further\nmodification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition,\n\u201ccontrol\u201d includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make,\nuse, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate\nthe contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \u201cpatent license\u201d is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \u201cgrant\u201d such a patent license to a party\nmeans to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent\nagainst the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and\nthe Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy,\nfree of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly\navailable network server or other readily accessible means, then you must\neither (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2)\narrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this\nparticular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the\nrequirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\nrecipients. \u201cKnowingly relying\u201d means you have actual knowledge that, but\nfor the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or\nyour recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one\nor more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to\nbelieve are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement,\nyou convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and\ngrant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work\nauthorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of\nthe covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically\nextended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are\na party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of\ndistributing software, under which you make payment to the third party\nbased on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under\nwhich the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the\ncovered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection\nwith copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those\ncopies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or\ncompilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that\narrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\nimplied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be\navailable to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission\nto link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3\nof the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and\nto convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to\napply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements\nof the GNU Affero General Public License, Section 13, concerning\ninteraction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of\nany later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of\nthe GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement\nof acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that\nversion for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions.\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright\nholder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above\ncannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing\ncourts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\nwaiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a\nwarranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in\nreturn for a fee.\n\n18. Indemnification\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, you will indemnify NOBLE, the\ncopyright holder (if a party other than NOBLE), and authors of the Program\nfor any liability resulting from your conveyance of the Program. The\nprevious sentence shall not apply to any material in the Program that was\nnot developed by the copyright holder or authors of the Program."
