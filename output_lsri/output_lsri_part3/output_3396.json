        "value": "MicrographCleaner employs an U-net-based deep learning model to segmentate micrographs into good regions and bad regions. Thus, it is mainly used as a post-processing step after particle picking in which coordinates selected in high contrast artefacts, such as carbon, will be ruled out. Additionally, it can be employed to generate binary masks so that particle pickers can be prevented from considering problematic regions.\nThus, micrograph_cleaner employs as a mandatory argument a(some) micrograph(s) fileneame(s) and the particle size in pixels (with respect input mics). Additionally it can recive as input:\n\n1) A directory where picked coordinates are located and another directory where scored/cleaned coordiantes will be saved. Coordinates will be saved in pos format or plain text (columns whith header colnames x and y) are located. \nThere must be one different coordinates file for each micrograph named as the micrograph and the output coordiantes will preserve the naming.  \nE.g. -c path/to/inputCoordsDirectory/ -o /path/to/outputCoordsDirectory/  \nAllowed formats are xmipp pos, relion star and raw text tab separated with at least two columns named as xcoor, ycoor in the header.\nRaw text file example:\n```\nmicFname1.tab:\n###########################################\nxcoor ycoor otherInfo1 otherInfo2\n12  143  -1  0.1\n431  4341  0  0.2\n323  321  1  0.213\n###########################################\n```\n2) A directory where predicted masks will be saved (mrc format).\nE.g. --predictedMaskDir path/where/predictedMasksWillBeSaved/  \n\n3) A downsampling factor (can be less than 1 if actually upsampling was performed) in case the coordinates where picked from\nmicrographs at different scale.\nE.g. -s 2 will downsample coordinates by a factor 2 and then it will apply the predicted mask that is as big as the input micrographs. This\ncase corresponds to an example in which we use for particle picking raw micrographs but we are using MicrographCleaner with downsampled mics  \n\n4) Any combination of previous options.  \n\nTrained MicrographCleaner model is available at http://campins.cnb.csic.es/micrograph_cleaner/ and can be automatically download executing  \n`cleanMics --download`\n\n\nBeware that if you installed micrograph_cleaner using pip/source, then CUDA and cudnn libraries should be\navailable prior execution, so if CUDA is not found, export its path prior execution  \n```\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cuda/cuda-9.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n```\nand then execute `cleanMics` program  \n"
