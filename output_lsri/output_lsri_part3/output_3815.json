Introduction\nCircAST v1.0.0 (CircRNAs with Alternative Spliced Transcripts) is a computational tool for circular RNA full-length assembly and quantification using RNA-Seq data with the back-spliced events detected by upstream circRNA identification tools, such as UROBORUS, CIRI2, or CIRCexplorer2. Original codes and detailed manuals are included in the downloading URL: https://github.com/xiaofengsong/CircAST/archive/v1.0.2.tar.gz.\n\nAuthors: Jing Wu (wujing@njmu.edu.cn), Xiaofeng Song (xfsong@nuaa.edu.cn) <br>\nMaintainer: Jing Wu (wujing@njmu.edu.cn)\n\n\n# 2. Prerequisites\n>* ### Software Prerequisites:\n>> CircAST is implemented in Python2 under Linux system. Since several packages are required for using CircAST, we suggest that users install corresponding version of Anaconda(Anaconda 2.5.0 +, Python 2.7 version).\n\n>* ### Input files:\n>> CircAST works with three input files. A GTF annotation file, a sorted Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) of pair-end reads generated by tophat2 and samtools, and a circRNA junction list containing the information of the back-spliced junctions which is generated by upstream identification tools such as CIRCexplorer2/CIRI2/UROBORUS or other similar tools.<br>\n\n>>> GTF annotataion files can be downloaded from https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html (UCSC source is recommanded, such as [hg19](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/genes/) and [mm10](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/bigZips/genes/)).\n\n>>> SAM file sotsorted by name can be obtained by the following commands:\n>>>> tophat -o results -p 12 -G /home/***/genes_homo.gtf /home/***/index/Homo_sapiens/UCSC/hg19/Sequence/BowtieIndex/genome reads_1.fastq reads_2.fastq <br>\n>>>> samtools sort -n -o accepted_hits.sorted.bam accepted_hits.bam <br>\n>>>> samtools view accepted_hits.sorted.bam > accepted_hits.sorted.sam <br>\n\n>>> CircRNA lists containing back-spliced junctions can be obtained by CIRCexplorer2/CIRI2/UROBORUS,  circ_out/denovo/annotated_circ.txt, result.txt, or circRNA_list.txt. CircRNA lists transformed into such formats using other circRNA back-spliced site detection software are also\u00a0also feasible. \n"
