A guide to install Conda is available here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/. After the installation, the virtual environment required for PepFun can be created using the following command: \n`conda create -c rdkit -n pepfun-env rdkit biopython matplotlib scipy pip pycairo nb_conda_kernels` \nTo activate the environment you can use the command: \n`source activate pepfun-env` \nAfter entering the virtual environment, you can install the igraph module for python3.6 using pip: \n`python3.6 -m pip install python-igraph` \n**EXTRA**: An addition was included to predict peptide conformers using MODELLER and PSIPRED. To install modeller with conda use the following command: \n`conda install -c salilab modeller` \n3. To run the Jupyter tutorial, please verify that Jupyter Notebook is installed in your environment.\n \n"

For that purpose, the script can be called as:\n\n`python pepfun.py -m sequence -s GYTRTEGSDF`\n\n**NOTE: Remember to activate first the conda virtual environment as explained previously.**\n\nThe output is a file with the name `sequence_analysis_[sequence].txt`, where multiple properties for the sequence are reported. An example of this and the explanation of the parameters is:\n\n```\n###########################################\nThe main peptide sequence is: GYTRTEGSDF\n###########################################\n\nCalculated properties:\nNet charge at pH 7: -1.0008535231234645\nMolecular weight: 1132.152\nAverage Hydrophobicity: -2.04\nIsoelectric Point: 4.37030029296875\nInstability index: 3.740000000000001\nNumber of hydrogen bond acceptors: 18\nNumber of hydrogen bond donors: 20\nCrippen LogP: -7.4280300000000254\n1 solubility rules failed from 5. The rules violated are the number(s): 3. *For details of the rules see the last part of the report.\n0 synthesis rules failed from 5. The rules violated are the number(s): None. **For details of the rules see the last part of the report.\n###########################################\n\nExplanation of the calculated parameters:\n- Net charge: average net charge based on pka values of each amino acid. By default a pH=7 is used.\n- Molecular weight: calculated in g/mol using the SMILES representation of the peptide.\n- Average Hydrophobicity: calculated by averaging the values of each amino acid hydrophobicity value from the Eisenberg scale.\n- Isoelectric point: obtained from the ProtParam package of the expasy server.\n- Instability Index: from ProtParam. It provides an estimate of the stability of the peptide in a test tube. Values smaller than 40 is predicted as stable, a value above 40 predicts as unstable.\n- Number of hydrogen bond acceptors: calculated using the SMILES representation of the peptide.\n- Number of hydrogen bond donors: calculated using the SMILES representation of the peptide.\n- Crippen LogP: estimation of the octanol/water partition coefficient using the Ghose/Crippen approach available in the RDKit project.\n###########################################\n\nThe last two results are the number of solubility and synthesis rules violated. The higher the number of rules violated, the lower the probability to be solubilized or synthesized experimentally (https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/SolyPep/).\n\n*List of solubility rules violations:\n1. Discard if the number of charged and/or of hydrophobic amino acids exceeds 45%\n2. Discard if the absolute total peptide charge at pH 7 is more than +1\n3. Discard if the number of glycine or proline is more than one in the sequence\n4. Discard if the first or the last amino acid is charged\n5. Discard if any amino acid represents more than 25% of the total sequence\n\n**List of synthesis rules violations:\n1. Discard if 2 prolines are consecutive\n2. Discard if the motifs DG and DP are present in the sequence\n3. Discard if the sequences ends with N or Q residues\n4. Discard if there are charged residues every 5 amino acids\n5. Discard if there are oxidation-sensitive amino acids (M, C or W)\n```\n\nIn addition, a file named `structure_[sequence].pdb` will contain the peptide structure predicted by the conformer option in RDKit (see main publication), which will have the correct numeration and order of the amino acids based on the input sequence. With the `-r modeller` option it is possible to predict the conformer using Modeller together with secondary structure restraints to be more accurate about the prediction. \n\n"
