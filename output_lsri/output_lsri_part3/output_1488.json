Just clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/bioinformatics-polito/PhyliCS_usage`) and pick one of the case studies available in one of the subfolders of the folder `data`.\n\nFor this tutorial, we use lung tumor data. You can find them at:\n```\nPhyliCS_usage/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 data\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 lung\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 metastasis\n\u2502       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 results.txt\n\u2502       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 SegCopy\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 primary\n\u2502           \u251c\u2500\u2500 results.txt\n\u2502           \u2514\u2500\u2500 SegCopy\n```\nWe start by loading CNV data of the primary tumor into an instance of the class 'phylics.Sample':\n```\n>>> navin_prim = phylics.Sample.from_file(\"PhyliCS_usage/data/lung/primary/SegCopy\", sample_name=\"primary\")\n```\n\nYou can check the content of the CNV matrix by typing:\n```\n>>> navin_prim.get_cnv_dataframe() #returns a pandas.DataFrame\n```\nor\n```\n>>> navin_prim.get_cnv_matrix() #returns a numpy.ndarray object\n\n```\n\nThen, we may add some annotations. Annotations are aggregated features of both cells and bins. For example, we may add the information about the mean copy-number for each cell. This information can be found in the `results.txt` file, which is available at the same position where the CNV data are stored. So we can load that information and attach it to our sample object as an annotation:\n\n```\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(\"PhyliCS_usage/data/lung/primary/results.txt\", sep=\"\\t\", index_col=0).dropna()\n>>> ploidy = df['Copy_Number']\n>>> navin_prim.add_annotation(ploidy, \"mean_cn\")\n```\n\nWe may also compute the median absolute deviation (MAD) for each CNV profile, by invoking:\n\n```\n>>> navin_prim.mad()\n```\n\nIn this case, the MAD of each cell is automatically attached as an annotation to the sample object.\n\nWe could also compute some annotations on the bins. For example, we may be interested on identifying the highly variable features and storing this information as a boolean annotation. It can be done by running:\n\n```\n>>> navin_prim.variable_features()\n```\n\nYou can explore the annotations you have loaded/computed on you sample by typing:\n```\n>>> navin_prim.get_annotations(\"obs\") #obs to get the cell annotations, feat to get the bin annotations\n            mean_cn     mad\nSRR089523   2.90        0.746891\nSRR089526   1.70        0.439316\nSRR089529   1.85        0.237948\nSRR089533   1.80        0.338593\nSRR089542   5.00        1.420739\n...         ...         ...\nSRR089697   4.45        1.376622\nSRR089698   4.40        1.411748\nSRR089699   4.30        1.287423\nSRR089700   4.35        1.509005\nSRR089701   4.25        1.484096\nSRR089702   4.20        1.350496\n```\nThis command returns a `pandas.DataFrame` which index correspondS to the cells/bins while the each columns store the annotations.\n\nWe may look at the distribution of the annotations. For example, you may be interesting in the distribution of the mean copy-number over the dataset and try to identify clusters. In that case, you need to run:\n```\n>>> navin_prim.plot_annotation_dist(\"mean_cn\", outpath=\"ploidy.png\", kind=\"kde\", figsize=(7,7))\n```\n<img src=\"figures/ploidy.png\" alt=\"primary lung tumor mean cn distribution\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nIn this case, it is evident that the dataset is made of two major group of cells, characterized by a mean CN \u2248 2 and a mean CN \u2248 4.5, respectively.\n"

You can provide all of them also to PhyliCS clustering method.\n\nWe decide to cluster our data using KMeans algorithm which requires to declare the desidered number of clusters. In our case, looking the the UMAP embeddings, it is evident that the best option would be K=2; anyhow, we may test different values of K and compute three indices (the Silhouette Coefficient, the Calinsky-Harabasz index, the Davies-Bouldin index), to pick the optimal one. This functionality is provided only for algorithms which need to be seeded with the cluster number in advance. In this case, we run:\n```\n>>> navin_prim.nk_clust(method=\"kmeans\", min_k=2, max_k=8, embeddings=\"umap\")   #embeddings=\"umap\" is used to cluster on umap embeddings \n                                                                                #which must have been previously computed\n   silhouette        db           ch\nk                                   \n2    0.950287  0.067556  8013.605078\n3    0.564663  0.728264  5656.483050\n4    0.586789  0.626557  5028.886910\n5    0.360388  0.905360  4664.868637\n6    0.355422  0.914987  4511.674714\n7    0.348100  0.863121  4249.581234\n8    0.343999  0.852076  4051.807112\n```\nAs it was expected, the best option, in this case is K=2. Anyhow, also K=3 and K=4 may be tested, since there may be subclusters which are not evident from the UMAP representation.\n\nWe chose K=2 and run:\n```\n>>> navin_prim.cluster(method=\"kmeans\", n_clusters=2, embeddings=\"umap\")\n```\nAfter that, we plot the clustering result in a heatmap:\n```\nnavin_prim.plot_clusters(plot=\"heatmap\", outpath=\"heatmap.png\")\n```\n<img src=\"figures/heatmap.png\" alt=\"primary lung tumor clustering heatmap\" width=\"700\"/>\n\nThe rows of the above heatmap represent the CNV profile of each cell and are sorted according to the cluster they belong. The colored bars on the left of the heatmap represent the different clusters. In this case, as it was expected, the algorithm divided the dataset into two subgroups of cells, characterized by a mean CN \u2248 2 and a mean CN \u2248 4.5, respectively.\n"

We run:\n\n```\n>>> navin_met = phylics.Sample.from_file(\"PhyliCS_usage/data/lung/metastasis/SegCopy\", sample_name=\"metastasis\")\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(\"PhyliCS_usage/data/lung/metastasis/results.txt\", sep=\"\\t\", index_col=0).dropna()\n>>> ploidy = df['Copy_Number']\n>>> navin_met.add_annotation(ploidy, \"mean_cn\")\n>>> navin_met.mad()\n```\n\nBefore computing the score we filter out cells which mean CN \u2248 2, because they are uninformative, and keep only with mean CN >= 3; additionally, we keep only cells with MAD <= 95th percentile and removed noisy ones: \n\n```\nnavin_prim = navin_prim.filter(\"mean_cn\", \"gt_eq\", 3)\nnavin_prim = navin_prim.filter(\"mad\", \"lt_eq\", 0.95, percentile=True)\nnavin_met = navin_met.filter(\"mean_cn\", \"gt_eq\", 3)\nnavin_met = navin_met.filter(\"mad\", \"lt_eq\", 0.95, percentile=True)\n```\n\nWe can, finally, compute the SHscore. To that purpose, we introduce another class, named MultiSample, which extends the  features of the Sample class. We run:\n```\nss = phylics.MultiSample.from_list(navin_prim, navin_met)\n>>> ss.SHscore(n_jobs=4)        #n_jobs = N for parallel computing. In this case, 4 cores are used to speedup computation\n    samples_partition           score\n0   [[primary], [metastasis]]   0.536134\n```\n\nTo conclude, we can plot a multi-sample heatmap with a dendrogram computed performing hierarchical clustering of the cells. Heatmap rows, representing the cells from the different samples, are identified by different colored labels. In this way, it is possible to see if the clustering algorithm has put the cells from separate samples in separate blocks or it has mixed them up.
