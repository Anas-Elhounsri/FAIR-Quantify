So create a subdirectory, enter it, build, and run tests:\n\n```\nmkdir somatic-sniper/build\ncd somatic-sniper/build\ncmake ../\nmake deps\nmake -j\nmake test\n```\n\nThe binary `bam-somaticsniper` can then be found under `somatic-sniper/build/bin`. If you have administrative rights, then run `sudo make install` to install the tool for all users under `/usr/bin`.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### I get lots of compile errors indicating that files are missing. How do I fix this?\n\nSomaticSniper requires that it be linked to an old version of samtools (v0.1.6). This typically happens because you have attempted to link to a newer version. As of version [1.0.3](https://github.com/genome/somatic-sniper/releases/tag/v1.0.3), SomaticSniper includes samtools as part of its build process and you do not need to download samtools yourself.\n\n### I get errors from cmake about missing modules. How do I fix this?\n\nAs of commit [09ef624](https://github.com/genome/somatic-sniper/commit/09ef624e5bb275e0fd62396a14a878711e746cb9) or version [1.0.4](https://github.com/genome/somatic-sniper/releases/tag/v1.0.4), this should no longer be an issue and tarballs from github should function as intended. In earlier versions, SomaticSniper contained a git submodule called build-common. This submodule contains helper modules for cmake. If you downloaded the source as a tarball from github or forgot to do a recursive clone using git, then you will not have this submodule and will see cmake errors. If you are using git, we recommend you go back and use the `--recursive` option when cloning the SomaticSniper repository. If you cannot use git, follow the instructions below to remedy the situation.\n\n1. Download the build-common module separately [here](https://github.com/genome/build-common/tarball/master).\n2. Extract that tarball and rename the directory it creates to `build-common`.\n3. Replace the empty build-common subdirectory in the sniper directory with directory you just created.\n4. Resume following the build instructions.\n\n### I get a floating point exception on running `bam-somaticsniper`. What's going on?\n\nThis has been reported when using reference fasta indexes available via the GATK resource bundle. Please try reindexing your fasta with samtools and rerunning `bam-somaticsniper`.\n"

        "description": "#### Major Changes\n\nThis release alters how counts and average base qualities are reported in the VCF. Previous versions double counted ambiguous bases and improperly restricted the `BCOUNT` field to bases called in the tumor and normal genotypes (see [#5](https://github.com/genome/somatic-sniper/issues/5)). With this release, `DP4` is now more stringent, only counting a read as a reference base if it matches that base exactly. `BCOUNT` is similarly more stringent and no longer reports ambiguous bases. \n\nFor calculating VAFs from the VCF output, we recommend using the `BCOUNT` field's value for your base of interest and dividing by the sum of the values in the `BCOUNT` field. This will prevent you from including ambiguous bases in your overall depth measure.\n\n#### Minor Changes\n- `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is now respected if specified during compilation.\n- A compilation error with unit tests on Max OS X (and possibly other platforms) was fixed.\n- Numerous documentation updates\n",

Gain-of-heterozygosity calls are defined as those where the reference allele is not present in the normal genotype call, but _is_ present in the tumor. For example the following calls would both be suppressed,\n\n| Ref | Tumor | Normal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A | GG | AG |\n| A | AG | GG |\n\n#### Minor Changes\n- build-common is now utilized as a git subtree.

        "description": "The latest release of SomaticSniper, The Genome Institute's somatic\nSNV calling workhorse, adds an alternative statistical model that\nbetter accounts for the rarity of somatic events by jointly\nconsidering the tumor and normal genotypes.  This version also adds\nnative support for the VCF and BED formats as output.  The VCF output\ncontains information useful for downstream filtering, e. g., fraction\nof reads on the forward and reverse strands, average read mapping\nquality, and average base quality for reads/bases supporting the\nvariant allele and those supporting the reference allele.\n",

        "description": "The purpose of this program is to identify single nucleotide positions that are different between tumor and normal (or, in theory, any two bam files). It takes a tumor bam and a normal bam and compares the two to determine the differences. It outputs a file in a format very similar to Samtools consensus format. It uses the genotype likelihood model of MAQ (as implemented in Samtools) and then calculates the probability that the tumor and normal genotypes are different. This probability is reported as a somatic score. The somatic score is the Phred-scaled probability (between 0 to 255) that the Tumor and Normal genotypes are not different where 0 means there is no probability that the genotypes are different and 255 means there is a probability of 1 \u2013 10<sup>(255/-10)</sup> that the genotypes are different between tumor and normal. This is consistent with how the SAM format reports such probabilities.\n",
