It can display one or more traits in the context of relevant biological data (such as gene models and other genomic annotation), and allows interactive refinement of analysis models (by selecting linkage disequilibrium reference panels, identifying sets of likely causal variants, or comparisons to the GWAS catalog). It can be embedded in web pages to enable data sharing and exploration. Views can be customized and extended to display other data types such as phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) results, chromatin co-accessibility, or eQTL measurements. A new web upload service harmonizes datasets, adds annotations, and makes it easy to explore user-provided result sets.\"\nauthors:\n  -\n    family-names: Boughton\n    given-names: Andrew\n    orcid: \"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0318-4912\"\n  -\n    family-names: Welch\n    given-names: Ryan\n  -\n    family-names: Flickinger\n    given-names: Matthew\n  -\n    family-names: VandeHaar\n    given-names: Peter\n  -\n    family-names: Taliun\n    given-names: Daniel\n  -\n    family-names: Abecasis\n    given-names: \"Gon\u00e7alo\"\n  -\n    family-names: Boehnke\n    given-names: Michael\ncff-version: \"1.1.0\"\ndate-published: \"2021-03-18\"\ndoi: \"10.1093/bioinformatics/btab186\"\njournal: \"Bioinformatics\"\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite the paper.\"\ntitle: \" LocusZoom.js: interactive and embeddable visualization of genetic association study results\"\n# Insert dummy version b/c the paper reports ongoing efforts\nversion: 1.0\n"

        "description": "\ud83d\udca3 This release makes many internal changes to how LocusZoom retrieves and uses data. It is primarily aimed at simplifying existing features for new and future LocusZoom.js users. If you are upgrading from a prior version, we have tried to provide a guide to what has changed, but read the notes carefully. \ud83d\udca3 \r\n\r\nThe new version provides new functionality that should make it easier to create custom plots from various types of file. Some minor display changes have also been added to improve the appearance and readability of figures.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n* Built in parsers and a new \"Tabix Tracks Demo\" make it easier to generate plots from tabix files for GWAS, BED, and user-provided LD, without manually creating a JSON file or loading the data into an API first. This should make it easier to get started with small in house datasets!\r\n* Developer-focused internal changes make some aspects of generating plots less confusing. The README and getting started guide have also been revised to reflect current usage.\r\n* Both GWAS and PheWAS layouts will now try to render points with an up/down triangle to indicate direction of effect, when possible. Internally this uses the new `effect_direction` ScaleFunction, inspired by PheWeb.\r\n* Default plot font sizes have been increased by 20-40%, to help readability in publications/presentations\r\n* New more compact LD \"ribbon\" legend\r\n* (from LZ 0.13.x) New \"turbo\" color scheme provides better support for colorblind users (or black and white printing)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Internal improvements\r\n* Plots can now switch between different view regions more quickly, thanks to a new multi-value LRU cache that can eliminate unnecessary network requests\r\n* `TabixUrlSource` now accepts a pre-made reader instance . This is useful for sites that want to validate file contents before adding the file to the plot.\r\n* Data layers now accept a template expression for `id_field`. This means that data elements can be uniquely identified as a combination of several fields. This eliminates the need to add \"synthetic\" unique ID fields in plots like phewas or coaccessibility, where no single datum field would have been globally unique. This also means that certain tooltip and mouse behaviors will be more stable as the user pans and zooms.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations and major breaking changes\r\nWe generally try to avoid issuing breaking changes, but after 5+ years of LocusZoom.js, we are doing some tidying to make custom and interactive usages easier. Please consult the updated documentation and guides, and let us know if any important information is missing after the rewrite!\r\n\r\n### Layout syntax\r\n* `Namespaces` have been redesigned as the central mechanism for plotting two datasets with one reusable layout.\r\n  * The difference between \"abstract\" and \"concrete\" layouts has been eliminated. Syntax like `Layouts.get(..., {unnamespaced: true})`  or `some_value: '{{{{namespace[assoc}}afield}}'` is no longer necessary. All layers will now refer to fields by an internal name that is easier to read, write, and remember: `assoc:afield`.\r\n  * Useful migration regex: replace `\\{\\{namespace\\[(\\w+)\\]\\}\\}` with `$1:`\r\n* New `data_operations` make it possible to mix-and-match different datasets, by moving the join logic from adapter to the point where the data is used (the data layer).\r\n  *  This replaces the old `combineChainBody` method of adapters. Closely coupling the act of retrieval (API) to the join logic (display) made it hard to use data fetched from a different location.\r\n  * This also makes it much easier for a single API call to be displayed in several different ways throughout the plot.\r\n* The `data_layer.fields` array property has been removed completely. Many people wanted to customize their data with just one extra field, and manually updating the contract of expected data proved cumbersome.\r\n* Panel layouts must now provide an explicit `id` (no longer optional). Most layouts already did this.\r\n* subscribeToData call signature has changed. It now accepts either an explicit specification of what data is requested, or else the name of a data layer (\"give me exactly what is being used to draw something that is already specified elsewhere\"). See docs for details.\r\n* Removed old aliases for things that were renamed in prior versions: all references to `dashboard.components` now use `toolbar.widgets`\r\n\r\n### Adapters\r\n* Adapters have been completely rewritten in a more functional style, making them easier to understand and debug. Many methods have been renamed slightly to reflect that they have a different call signature. Almost all custom adapter subclasses will need to update their code.\r\n  * Example: `getURL(state, chain, fields)` is now `_getURL(request_options)`; `annotateData(records, chain)` is now `_annotateRecords(records, request_options)`, etc. \r\n* The concept of the data chain has been eliminated; it was confusing and made it hard to use the same data in two different ways. \r\n  * New \"data operations\", like \"joins\", specify how to connect two datasets at the point where the data is *used*, rather than when the data is first retrieved. The adapter method `combineChainBody` has been totally removed in favor of `data_layer.data_operations`. Several join functions are provided by default.\r\n  * If your request depends on a prior request (like \"LD for a particular GWAS variant\"), a new dependency resolver has been introduced. See the guides/tutorials describing `data_operations: [{type: 'fetch', from: ['assoc', 'ld(assoc)']}]` for details of how to specify dependent requests.\r\n* Adapter options are now specified as top-level keys, instead of inside a nested key called`params: {}`. Existing sample code to create a plot will need to revise usages of `DataSources.add()`.\r\n* Adapters will usually return all the fields from the API.\r\n  * All pre-defined data layer layouts now contain an `_auto_fields` variable that defines what information a layer expects. At the time of render, a user-friendly error message will warn if the server fails to provide expected fields.\r\n  * If you use LD information, rename `ld:isrefvar` to `lz_is_ld_refvar` and `ld:state` to `ld:correlation`. The new names for \"auto-generated\" properties better reflect what is actually coming back from the API, and make the code far easier to understand.\r\n* Any data source specified in `data_layer.namespaces` will now trigger a network request for data. This is different than the previous behavior, where a different property (\"fields\") had to also be mutated\r\n  * People really liked adding custom fields/ data to the plot, but no one ever remembered to update `data_layer.fields`. This lead to a lot of confusion when their data failed to appear. \r\n\r\n### Other\r\n* Many private variables were renamed in LocusZoom plot and panel internals. This should make the console debugging experience nicer, by hiding things that were not useful to most developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes:\r\n* If the user selects an LD refvar, ignore the choice when switching to another region far from that variant.\r\n* Cached adapter data now does a better job of isolating each individual layer that uses the data. This is especially noteworthy in, eg, `StaticSource`\r\n* Fix an issue where plot would be sized incorrectly when initially drawn in a hidden area (like collapsible or tab widgets). Plot will now resize to fit available space when the area is un-collapsed.\r\n* Fix broken rendering of intervals (eg BED tracks) if they had very narrow markings\r\n* Increase spacing around axis labels (so that plots look good with logp > 1000; previously, 4-digit numbers overlapped with the label)",

        "description": "This release is focused on improvements for performance and interactivity. It contains several changes of particular use when displaying a lot of data at once, as well as bugfixes and documentation that will help with generating highly customized plots.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n### User facing\r\n* The documentation has been completely overhauled. The wiki has been replaced with new [public docs](https://statgen.github.io/locuszoom/docs) . This includes several newly written prose user guides (getting started, data, layouts, and interactivity) as well as deep developer documentation.\r\n* \"Standard\" datasets like genes, recombination rate, and GWAS catalog will now fetch the newest data available from the UM PortalDev API, rather than hard-coding a specific (possibly outdated) dataset ID. \r\n\t* This will give your users a better LZ.js experience over time, even if you don't update your code very often.\r\n* New data layer rendering options:\r\n\t* `highlight_region`  (beta) draws one or more translucent rectangles to draw attention to a part of the plot.\r\n\t* `lz-intervals-enrichment` (beta) Renders categorical interval-based data in a shared area, with y-axis prioritized by pvalues from enrichment analysis.\r\n\t* All panels now show loading indicators at first render, enabled by default. This is controlled by the new `panel_layout.show_loading_indicator` option. It replaces the old imperative function call, `panel.addBasicLoader`.\r\n\r\n### Developer-friendly features\r\n* New `stable_choice` scaling function allows predictable auto-coloring of items, especially categorical data. Unlike random selection, this will choose the same colors regardless of page reload or data order.\r\n* Allow match and filter behavior to use field transforms and custom operators via the new `LocusZoom.MatchFunctions` plugin registry. This allows greater control over interactive functionality.\r\n* Tooltip templates now support an optional `{{#else}}` block. This is useful for writing tooltips with toggle buttons: \"show/hide label\", \"is ld reference variant\", etc.\r\n* Several new events have been added to identify when a widget has been used. See documentation for details.\r\n\t* Additionally, tooltips and widgets are now allowed to emit \"custom\" events not pre-defined to LocusZoom (the old behavior was restrictive- unrecognized events would not be fired)\r\n\t* This is useful for analytics (to find out which features of the plot are used most often).  Many widgets can now fire additional events when they are used: `widget_display_options_choice`, `widget_download_png`, `widget_download_svg`, `widget_filter_field_action`,  `widget_set_state_choice`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Internal improvements\r\n* The rendering code has been refactored throughout LocusZoom to use fewer resources when rendering plots with a large number of elements. (eg many variants in a wide genomic region)\r\n* Zooming in to a region plot will now use cached data instead of making an unnecessary network request. This means that zooming will be faster and more responsive.\r\n* GWAS scatter plots may now hide some overlapping low-significance variants by default.\r\n\t* This is controlled by the options under `scatter_layout.coalesce`. This can reduce the number of points to render by 40-50% for a narrow region or noisy plot, and >90% for a GWAS with a few strong hits in a wide viewing region.\r\n* Improved the coaccessibility/arc track demo with new highlighting marks and better demonstration of enhancer / promoter / target gene matching\r\n\r\n## Deprecations and breaking changes\r\n* Tooltip templates no longer treat `0` values as truthy. To conditionally show a value (even if it is 0), use the new `is_numeric` transformation function: `{{#if value|is_numeric}}...{{/if}}`\r\n\t* This is slightly less convenient, but a lot less confusing.\r\n* Renamed the \"magic field\"  `lz_highlight_match` to `lz_is_match` to reflect that matching is useful for controlling a wide range of scalable presentation options. (this synthetic field can also be used for size, shape, or even filtering)\r\n* The gene constraint tooltip will no longer contact an external API in cases where the query would return no data (eg, gnomAD limits queries to 25 elements and build GRCh37 only)\r\n* Most datasets now use a new implementation of `getCacheKey`. Instead of caching when the region is an exact match, it now considers whether the requested chrom/start/end is a subset of the prior region.\r\n* /shift-clicking/ on a plot element will no longer allow \"multiselect\". Few people used this feature. It can still be enabled manually, but is now turned off by default.\r\n* Several little-used features have been moved to extensions, in order to make the library smaller for most users\r\n\t* Intervals data layer (`lz-intervals-track`)\r\n\t* Forest plot data layer (`lz-forest-track`)\r\n* Removed the `dimensions` toolbar widget, as it was widely unused.\r\n* Removed unused or confusing configuration options related to height and width, including `proportional_*`.  Plot width is now controlled solely by `plot_layout.width` and height is now solely defined by `sum(panel_layouts.height)`.\r\n* Internal build changes may affect people using LocusZoom.js with extremely old web browser versions. If your deployment needs to support such users, you may need to add your own tooling. For everyone else, enjoy the 25% smaller file size.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n* Fixed issues that caused panels to become distorted when elements were resized (see \"breaking changes\" above)\r\n* Fix issues with label display on scatter plots (double escaping of text + labels not removed on re-render)\r\n* The LD reference variant will now be correctly marked as such, even if your dataset uses non-standard variant marker formats.\r\n* Fix an issue with  `link` behavior on data elements\r\n* Initiating a match event will now cause tooltips on other panels to be removed, rather than reappearing as zombie elements\r\n* Annotation tracks (like GWAS catalog) will now be better aligned with variants in the scatter plot",

        "description": "## Features\r\n*  Rendering performance improvements\r\n    * Use fewer system resources/ listeners/ function calls to render each scatter plot point (cache computed values, event bubbling, etc)\r\n* Provide an option to coalesce adjacent points in the scatter plot. This can reduce the number of points to render by 40-50% for a narrow region or noisy plot, and >90% for a GWAS with a few strong hits in a wide viewing region. (controlled by the new scatter layer option section, `coalesce._`)\r\n  * Coalescing is turned on by default for association plots (only). You may wish to adjust this behavior and options if you use a different y-axis range for your plots (eg, user-selectable \"toggle y-axis display\" behaviors)\r\n  * The final rendered result will appear almost indistinguishable from plots without coalescing. All significant points and \"highlight matching points\" behaviors will be preserved.\r\n\r\n## Deprecations:\r\n* Remove shift-click \"multiselect\" from plots: few people seem to use this feature, and it adds complexity for limited gain\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes:\r\n* Correctly remove old scatter plot labels on toggle/re-render\r\n* Fix double-escaping issue with label display values",

        "description": "**This version contains numerous breaking changes and new features. Although we have tried to keep most familiar aspects of using LocusZoom intact, please read carefully before upgrading.**\r\n\r\n**If you are using LocusZoom via `<script>` tag, LocusZoom now requires D3v5. Check any other visualizations on your site for compatibility.**\r\n\r\n## New features for users\r\nSeveral new features are available and enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* New \"save as PNG\" feature \r\n* Fix \"scroll to zoom\" in Firefox (new \"alt-scroll\" keyboard shortcut)\r\n* Better LD by default\r\n\t* Build 38 datasets will now use an improved LD panel based on deep WGS sequencing of 1000G.\r\n\t* The \"select LD population\" button has been added to the default layout for all association plot toolbars (this button must be used with the `LDServer` adapter)\r\n* Improved genes track\r\n\t* Now hides pseudogenes by default.\r\n\t*  A dropdown menu can be used to customize what is shown.\r\n\t* Visual tweaks: Genes track now shows more genes in the same amount of space (better for publications etc)\r\n* Gene and GWAS catalog views refreshed with the newest data available (GENCODE v35 and GWAS catalog v1.0 e100)\r\n\r\n\r\n## New features for developers\r\nLocusZoom is highly customizable. We have added a variety of internal improvements that make it easier to build truly dynamic visualizations.\r\n\r\n* New \"filters\" mechanism lets users interactively choose which points are shown on scatter, arc, forest, and gene tracks, based on customizable criteria. \r\n\t* A new toolbar widget can be used to let users change filters interactively\r\n* The \"save as svg\" button no longer relies on a hardcoded CSS file name. This should resolve issues where saved images did not look good on some sites.\r\n* New `region_changed` plot-level event reports exact plot coordinates after pan, zoom, or region change\r\n* New `log10` transformation function (a complement to `neglog10`). Useful for creating, eg, loglog plots.\r\n* New `plot.destroy()` cleanup method: helps to avoid memory leaks when using LocusZoom with single-page-application frameworks like Vue or React.\r\n* More systematic way of registering and bundling LZ plugins (`LocusZoom.use(function(LocusZoom, ...args) { /* plugin code*/ })`)\r\n* All registries (layouts, adapters, datasources, etc) are now more consistent in their behavior, exposing `add`, `remove`, `has`, `get`, and `list` methods. Efforts have been made to preserve method syntax for any existing usages. \r\n\r\n## Important breaking changes\r\nThe code was heavily reorganized. Unused features were removed, and some improvements were made to make the library more approachable for new developers.\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n*  LocusZoom is now based on D3v5. If you are using the library via a script tag, you will need to update the D3 version used. We no longer provide a `vendor.js` bundle.\r\n  * Some breakages may occur due to D3 changes. For example, `triangle-up` is now `triangle`, and `triangle-down` was removed from the library.\r\n* All extensible \"plugin\" features are now based on ES6 classes, making it easier to customize small pieces of functionality (like new data layers)\r\n* The codebase is now based on ES6 modules. Many \"private\" features have been moved out of the global namespace, to avoid overwhelming developers with functions they don't need.\r\n\t* LocusZoom will *only* be exposed as a global variable if you load it via `<script>` tag. \r\n\t* If your code uses ES6 modules, `import LocusZoom from 'locuszoom';` will continue to work. But you should update how you import extensions for best results: use `locuszoom/esm/ext/...` instead of  `locuszoom/dist/ext/...`\r\n\r\n### Renamed features\r\nTo support doc/instruction improvements, several things have been renamed.\r\n\r\n * Three different things had \"data source\" in their names and all were available globally. This was unnecessarily confusing. \r\n\t  * `LocusZoom.KnownDataSources` -> `LocusZoom.Adapters`\r\n\t  *  `Data.Source` has been renamed to  `BaseApiAdapter` and is no longer available as a global. \r\n\t\t  * Users of modern ES6 may import it from `locuszoom/data` to create true ES6 subclasses. \r\n\t\t  * If using via a `<script>` tag, the shortcut for creating and registering a new class will be almost the same as old versions: `LocusZoom.Adapters.extend('BaseApiAdapter', 'MySourceName', {})` .\r\n\t  * The helper used to assign data for a specific plot (`LocusZoom.DataSources`) was left unchanged.\r\n  * `dashboards`  are now called `toolbars` , and `Dashboard.Components` -> `Widgets`. \r\n\t  * This rename will affect layouts: eg `dashboard.components` should be changed to `toolbar.widgets` and `Layouts.get('dashboard'...)` -> `Layouts.get('toolbar'...)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New/improved defaults\r\n* Plots now handle resizing differently. The old `responsive_resize: both` mode has been removed. The default option (true) will now trigger resize only for width.\r\n\t*  Preserving aspect ratio sometimes caused odd behavior on re-render.  Many sites that use LZ have already migrated to the new default.\r\n* Most usages of the `genes` datalayer should now use `genes_filtered` instead. This is intended to work best with the new \"hide pseudogenes by default\" behavior used by the default genes panel.\r\n* Layouts (such as annotation tracks) that used filters now have a new unified syntax, where each filter is represented as an object with `{field, operator, value}` keys. This extends and standardizes the quasi-public implementation of track filters from previous releases.\r\n  * Some old layouts represented each filter in an array form and will need to be updated.\r\n\r\n### Removals\r\n* Any methods previously marked as `deprecated` in prior releases have been removed. In previous versions, these were usually indicated by warning messages on the JS console.\r\n* The `LocusZoom.createCORSPromise` method has been removed. Internal usages have been replaced with the standard JS [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) function; we recommend doing the same with your own code.\r\n* The old `LDLZ` data source (adapter) has been completely removed, because it referenced an old server. Prior LocusZoom versions had already introduced its replacement, `LDLZ2` (also known as `LDServer`).\r\n* `Data.Source.extend` has been removed, in favor of true ES6 classes. \r\n* Removed `setElementStatusByFilters` and largely unused methods.\r\n* Remove `datalayer.addField` method, due to limited utility. It is better to know what fields are required before requesting the data.\r\n* Removed \"transition\" option from layouts, which was poorly supported and largely unused.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\nIf you are testing experimental LocusZoom features, we have changed the build scripts. Gulp has been removed and replaced with new commands: `npm run dev` and `npm run build`. The unit tests now support test coverage.\r\n\r\nThe build process and modules work on all currently supported node LTS versions: 10.x or above. Old versions of Ubuntu tend to ship with *very* old versions of nodeJS, so this is something to check if your modified locuszoom code refuses to build.\r\n\r\nIf you modify the code, we welcome open source contributions! Please share your improvements or suggestions.",

        "description": "- We have restored and improved gene constraint tooltips, using gnomAD as our new source of data. Using this feature on an existing site will require updating `LocusZoom.Datasources` options (see below). Tooltips now include o/e constraint metrics and confidence intervals. Genes with no constraint information now hide the table rather than showing blank fields.\r\n  - Currently gene constraint information is only available for build GRCh37\r\n- Fix a bug where panel titles were sometimes rendered twice\r\n\r\n# Breaking changes\r\n- Old layouts using GeneConstraintLZ will need to be updated to use the new gnomAD API URL, as well as to correctly specify the genome build. For example: `.add(\"constraint\", [\"GeneConstraintLZ\", { url: \"https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/api\", params: { build: 'GRCh37' } }]);`\r\n  - Although we generally try to preserve backwards compatibility, in this case, the old `GeneConstraintLZ` datasource was designed for a server (exAC) that is no longer available, and no custom datasources were found in an audit of users. Therefore the datasource has been redefined to use a different request and response format based on gnomAD.",

We encourage all users to migrate off the old (legacy) LD API ( http://portaldev.sph.umich.edu/api/v1/pair/LD/results ), and enjoy new features made possible by the UMich LDServer.\r\n  * This widget is not part of the default layout, because many old LZ installations are still using the old URL\r\n* Dashboard widget improvements for developers\r\n  * A new plot-level set_state dashboard widget lets users select an item from a menu to change plot.state. This can be used to modify requests dynamically- eg, to provide configuration options used to make LD requests\r\n  * Developers can now control button text for the \"Download\" and \"Resize to data\" buttons\r\n  * Developers can now specify a default filename other than 'locuszoom.svg\" for the download image button\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n* The \"download plot as image\" button is now faster and works more reliably when saving images of large (or dense) plot regions\r\n* Default layouts and extensions will now more consistently apply the htmlescape filter for user-provided data\r\n* Fix issues where closed tooltips could reopen when panning, zooming, or other dynamic actions\r\n* \"Full height\" vertical lines will now redraw to the correct size when the plot is resized\r\n* Fix regression where x-axis labels did not update to show region, when the plot was dynamically redrawn\r\n\r\n## Deprecations/ breaking changes\r\n* The landing page for LocusZoom has been updated to emphasize CDNs. We no longer upload new versions of Locuszoom in a static asset folder on github; please migrate to using the CDN (or a build system like NPM + webpack) to get the newest code.\r\n* The syntax for specifying color of phewas scatter plots has changed. Users of the stock layout should automatically be upgraded, but code for custom color schemes may need to be changed.\r\n* All usages of the Q library have been replaced with native ES6 promises, including in the pre-bundled vendor.js. Custom code may need to be updated. In general this will involve small function renames.\r\n  * locuszoom.vendor.js incorporates a polyfill for modern ES6 Promises, to help existing LocusZoom users ensure support for old browsers.\r\n* Removed the \"gene constraint information\" table from gene track tooltips, due to lack of a data provider. This has been replaced with a link to gnomAD.\r\n  * This change was made because the data source (exAC) has been decommissioned, and the new gnomAD API does not yet support bulk queries.

This is useful for dynamic layouts or rug tracks (where more control over panel height is desired)\r\n- The display_options widget has improved control over legends and item labels\r\n- Improvements for development and debugging\r\n  - Many error messages now log debugging stacktraces to the console\r\n  - Issue console warnings for certain behaviors known to cause broken layouts\r\n- New plot level event: notify when a panel is removed.\r\n- Label and element filtering options now support `!=` to test for absence of a value.\r\n\r\n## Developer notes\r\n### Deprecation warnings\r\n- The original LD Source (LDLZ) is now deprecated. All examples have been upgraded to use `LDLZ2`, which uses the new Michigan [LDServer](https://github.com/statgen/LDServer). \r\n  - The new source supports multiple genome builds and configurable choice of reference panels; the previous LD source does not offer this functionality, and relies on a deprecated server endpoint.\r\n- The plot builder tool was unmaintained, and has been removed.\r\n- vendor.js has been updated to use a slightly newer d3 version. (3.5.6 --> 3.5.17)\r\n\r\n### Features and layout changes\r\n- Where possible, most \"region\" data sources (genes, recomb rate, and LD) will respond to a `state.genome_build` parameter, and automatically attempt to select the best API source for that build.\r\n  - `params.source` parameter is no longer required for many data sources. To ensure that your plot uses the newest and best version of data available, we recommend using `params.build` or `state.genome_build` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Better handling for regions with no data\r\n",
