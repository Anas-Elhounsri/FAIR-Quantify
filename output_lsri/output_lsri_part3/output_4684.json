Advances in developing highly accurate SS prediction methods have mostly been focused on 3-class (Q3) structure prediction.

SAINT offers a more interpretable framework than the typical black-box deep neural network methods. Through an extensive evaluation study, we report the performance of SAINT in comparison with the existing best methods on a collection of benchmark datasets, namely, TEST2016, TEST2018, CASP12 and CASP13.
