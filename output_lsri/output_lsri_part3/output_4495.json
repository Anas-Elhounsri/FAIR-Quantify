Install and run [Elasticsearch 7.17](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/install-elasticsearch.html) and download all [PubTatorCentral files](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/PubTatorCentral/PubTatorCentral_BioCXML/) on your server.

We strongly recommend using [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) or [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) as your Python environment.\n  - **How can I perform a clean uninstall of PEDL+?**\n    1. Uninstall the package: `pip uninstall pedl`\n    2. Delete the PEDL+ cache folder. You can typically find it under `~/.cache/pedl`. So you can delete it by running `rm -rf ~/.cache/pedl`.\n  - **I am running into issues with PEDL+. What can I do?**\n    - Try to perform a clean uninstall and reinstall of PEDL+. If the issue persists, please open an issue on GitHub and we will try to help you as soon as possible.\n   "
