We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:\n\n- Reporting a bug\n- Discussing the current state of the code\n- Submitting a fix\n- Proposing new features\n- Becoming a maintainer\n\n## We Develop with Github\nWe use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.\n\n## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests\nPull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes.\n5. Make sure your code lints.\n6. Issue that pull request!\n\n## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.\n\n## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!\n\n## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code\n[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report I wrote, and I think it's not a bad model. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), an app developer whom I greatly respect.\n\n**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:\n\n- A quick summary and/or background\n- Steps to reproduce\n  - Be specific!\n  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing\n- What you expected would happen\n- What actually happens\n- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)\n\nPeople *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.\n\n## Use a Consistent Coding Style\n\n\n## License\nBy contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.\n\n## References\nThis document was adapted from the open-source contribution guidelines for [Facebook's Draft](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"

Addresses issue[ #2268](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/issues/2268)\r\n\r\n**Glyco write individual file results**\r\n\r\n- Glyco search now writes individual result files for each file searched.\r\n\r\n**Updated MzLib from 1.0.538 -> 1.0.541**\r\n\r\n_mzLib_ 1.0.539\r\n\r\n- There was a bug wherein adding two chemical formulas with negative isotopes gave the wrong answer. The example was deamidation (H-1N-1O) plus deamidation. The expected answer is H-2N-2O2 but the original gave O2. Added by @trishorts in #697\r\n- Averaging Updates by @nbollis in #683\r\n- MsDataFile is now an abstract type defining methods to read data from files, both statically and dynamically.\r\n- Previously supported data types (.raw, .mzml. .mgf) are still supported with previous syntax, but can also now be constructed with the unified syntax below:\r\n\r\n_mzLib_ 1.0.541\r\n\r\n- Rectifies a significant slowdown caused by Readers refactor #698\r\n- Fixed chemical formula bug\r\n- Update to uniprot ptmlist.txt loader\r\n- Fixed xml.gz compression bug so we load complete xml\r\n- Added support for FlashDecon and TopFD file parsing\r\n- Improved ability of FlashLFQ to handle unusual characters in file input\r\n- Added support for negative deconvolution\r\n\r\n**Added additional support for TMT**\r\n\r\n- Reporter ions for multiplex tags now have their own columns in AllPSMs and AllPeptides .psmtsv files.\r\n\r\n**Filtering refactor**\r\n\r\n- Users are now able to specify PEP or PEP Q-Value thresholds that are used to filter results before quantification, spectral library generation, and output. \r\n- Protein parsimony is not affected. Filtering for parsimony is still hard-coded in PostSearchAnalysisTask.ProteinAnalysis.\r\n\r\n**Added null checks to enable display of XL results**\r\n\r\n- Previously, attempting to view crosslink search results in MetaDraw would cause a crash.\r\n\r\n**Eliminate PEP from FDR analysis during calibration**\r\n\r\n**Write spectrum library from PsmTsv in MetaDraw**\r\n\r\n- MetaDraw now includes a button that allows users to export selected PSMs as a spectral library\r\n- Added a new method to PsmFromTsv called ToLibrarySpectrum() that produces the library spectrum objectI copied the pdf/png export code in MetaDraw\r\n- The output was tested both in metadraw and in search. The written libraries load into metadraw and produce spectral angles in search.\r\n\r\n**Database download Test**\r\n\r\n- Expanded test coverage\r\n\r\n**Changed the main MetaMorpheus window to own Task windows**\r\n\r\n- New task windows will always appear on top of the main window when first launched. \r\n\r\n**Ethcd complementary ions**\r\n\r\n- Enabled the generation of complimentary ions with the EThcD activation type. \r\n\r\n**Fix string split in glyco protein parsimony**\r\n\r\n- Some protein accessions contain hyphens. Previously, this caused a crash during the glyco search task. This release replaces the hyphen with the hashtag eliminating the crash.\r\n\r\n**Averaging code added but not implemented**\r\n\r\n- Added code for the Spectral Averaging Task to refine the isotopic envelopes of top-down data prior to a database search. \r\n- Currently, Averaging can't be performed by users due to multiple known issues\r\n- Known Issue: On some devices, the averaging task window will crash upon launch when MetaMorpheus is installed via the .msi installer\r\n- Known Issue: On some devices, averaging task will begin and crash half way through\r\n\r\n**Full List of PRs**\r\n\r\n**New uniprot by @Jevs242 in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2264\r\n\r\n**Glyco write individual file results by @trishorts in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2252\r\n\r\n**Visualization Update Rebase by @nbollis and @trishorts in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2266\r\n\r\n**Spectral recovery by @Alexander-Sol in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2269\r\n\r\n**Update to MzLib 1.0.539 by @nbollis and @Alexander-Sol in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2276\r\n\r\n**Added additionally support for tmt labeling by @Alexander-Sol and @nbollis in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2278\r\n\r\n**Averaging task in MetaMorpheus by @nbollis, @avcarr and @elaboy in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2281\r\n\r\n**Filtering refactor by @Alexander-Sol in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2285\r\n\r\n**Added null checks to enable display of XL results by @Alexander-Sol in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2290\r\n\r\n**Eliminate PEP from FDR analysis during  calibration by @trishorts in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2294\r\n\r\n**Write spectrum library from PsmTsv in MetaDraw by @trishorts in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2295\r\n\r\n**Database download Test by @elaboy in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2282\r\n\r\n**Changed the main window to own the subsequent windows by @nbollis in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2297\r\n\r\n**Ethcd complementary ions by @trishorts in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2274\r\n\r\n**Updated to MzLib 1.0.541 and updated one unit test by @nbollis in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2304\r\n\r\n**Fix string split in glyco protein parsimony by @trishorts in**\r\nhttps://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/pull/2305\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus/compare/1.0.2...1.0.4\r\n\r\n**Note** The version number for this release and the GitHub tag are both 1.0.3, but this release is actually tagged 1.0.4.

        "description": "- MetaMorpheus has a new icon!\r\n- A machine-learning algorithm similar to Percolator is used to estimate PSM-level error probabilities (the posterior error probability, \"PEP\"). This replaces the e-value calculation\r\n- MSFileReader is no longer needed to read Thermo .raw files. Just drag your files in and accept the Thermo licence! Reading .raw files is faster now too\r\n- Added protein ambiguity to the crosslink search\r\n- In the crosslink search, if a single peptide outscores the alpha peptide, the single peptide is preferred. This helps correctly assign spectra with loop-linked missed cleavages\r\n- Added many UniMod accession numbers to MetaMorpheus's modifications, which are reported in the .mzID file\r\n- Fixed a bug where the nativeID for each PSM in the .mzID file was not correctly formatted\r\n- Fixed a bug where sometimes parsimony was very slow when many PTM-containing peptides were present and \"Treat modified peptides as different peptides\" was unchecked\r\n- Fixed a bug where the text boxes to search for a modification in the GUI would stop working",
