The data generation steps include: graph generation with node feaures, graph reduction, and graph to matrix conversion. \n\n**Since the entire data generation process, especially the collection of node features (affinities, disease scores, and gene expressions), is quite cumbersome, thus the following procedure is ONLY for generating testing data (no labels!!). If you wish to generate your own training data (with class labels), you will need to collect all features and GR values for them. Then follow the graph reduction instruction https://github.com/pulimeng/Biology-Network-Reduction/tree/main/PPI.**\n\nFor the convenient of most users, we provide all the features we collected. The user only need to input the drug-cell-line combinations they wish to generate graphs for. To generate data for desired drug and cell-line, one first need to download and untar the already reduced graph from https://osf.io/dzx7b/. They are named, `reduced_node_tables` and `reduced_edge_tables`. Then run\n<pre><code>python gr_datagen.py --i example_input --o output_folder</code></pre>\n - `--i` the file contains drug-cell-line pair you wish to generate data for, separated by commas. An example file in given as `example_input`. **Note that available drugs and cell-lines are also provided as drugs.lst and celllines.lst respectively.**\n - `--o` the folder you wish to store the generated data (.h5 files contain the matrices).\n"
