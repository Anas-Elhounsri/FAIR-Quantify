        "value": "\nNetworks provide a powerful representation of complex systems of interacting components. In addition to a wide range of available analytical and computational tools, networks also offer a visual interface for exploring large data in a uniquely intuitive fashion. <br>However, the size and complexity of many networks render static visualizations on common screen or paper sizes impractical and result in proverbial 'hairballs'. Here, we introduce an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) platform that overcomes these limitations and unlocks the full potential of visual, interactive exploration of large networks. <br>Our platform is designed towards maximal customization and extendability, with key features including import of custom code for data analysis, easy integration of external databases, and design of arbitrary user interface elements. As a proof of concept, we show how our platform can be used to interactively explore genome-scale molecular networks for identifying genetic aberrations responsible for rare diseases and develop hypotheses on their respective pathobiological mechanisms. <br>Our platform represents a first-of-its-kind, general purpose VR data exploration platform in which human intuition can work seamlessly together with state-of-the-art analysis methods for large and diverse data. \n<br>\n<br>\n**Note:** This project is still in an infant state of development. This is a public beta release, meaning it is not fit to be used in any critical applications yet and may still contain some bugs.\nYou can [get in touch](mailto:vrnetzer@menchelab.com) with us if you would like to contribute to the further development of this project.\n<br>\n<br>\n \n"

And vice versa \none specific attribute can be distributed over several nodes. \n**Note**\nThe database structure allows also attributes that are organized as an ontology tree. However it is not part of the uploader functionality yet. \nWe plan to provide it with the next release. \nAn important feature are selection lists. \nThey define subsets of your nodes that are of interest for specific task.\n(Such as a gene subset representing a list of patient variants.)\nThey can be loaded separately in a VR session to always have them highlighted. Moreover they serve as the initial set for several analytical procedures such as seeds for a random walk. \nSelection lists are a sub category of attributes and can be uploaded \nin the following way: \nPlease provide as attribute_id an user defined ID for your selection.\nThe name can be picked up in the VR session. \n"

Please watch this [video](https://youtu.be/W5tW_tb3LGk) that will help to get you started.\nThe VR Module comes preconfigured to connect to the other modules that we already installed on our server to make it easy for you to get a first impression. \nIt has the ability to upload your own datasets, but we don't recommend it. **Do NOT upload any sensitive data here**, this is **only for demonstration purposes** and for the whole world to see.

Please watch this [video](https://youtu.be/W5tW_tb3LGk) that will help to get you started.\nThe VR Module comes preconfigured to connect to the other modules that we already installed on our server to make it easy for you to get a first impression. \nIt has the ability to upload your own datasets, but we don't recommend it. **Do NOT upload any sensitive data here**, this is **only for demonstration purposes** and for the whole world to see. We don't guarantee your data's safety! If you want to work with your own data you should use the [Stand Alone](#Installation-Stand-Alone) version.\n"

Note the \"Console\" window, where debugging output is displayed. <br> ![alt text](pictures/t2-7.png)\n- open `VRNetzer/UI_Module/templates/main.html` in your editor\n- at the end of the file, after` <div id=\"tabs-7\">` add `<button id=\"MyNewButton\"> EXIT </button>`\n- save changes to main.html and refresh the browser by clicking in the red area and hit F5 <br>![alt text](pictures/t2-3.png)\n- if you now navigate to the right most tab again, the button appeared. It looks grey though, not like the other buttons. \n\nThe different elements of the page are set up in the html documents. All the logic happens in the JavaScript, in the `UI_Module\\static\\js` folder.\n\n**VRNetzer_API.js** is the most important, it has **all the functions to communicate between the Analytics Module and the VR Module.**\n\nThen there is **a file for each of the html files** (main_UI.js). These all have this initialization function `$(document).ready(function () {....}` and in there are functions **that bind to the UI elements created in Html**. For our button we do this:\n\n- at the end of main_UI.js, but still inside the document.ready() function put this code:<br> \n```\n$(function () {\n        $(\"#MyNewButton\").button();\n        $(\"#MyNewButton\").click(function (event) {\n            event.preventDefault();\n            logger(\"click!\") \n        });\n    });\n```\n- save and refresh the browser <br> ![alt text](pictures/t2-4.png)\n\nNow that jQuery is aware of the new button the css styling also works. Click it and the console outputs the message so we know it works.\n"
