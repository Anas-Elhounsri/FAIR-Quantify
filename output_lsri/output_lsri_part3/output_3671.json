        "value": "Specific, named biological sequences provide the reference and coordinate\nsystem for communicating variation and consequential phenotypic changes.\nSeveral databases of sequences exist, with significant overlap, all using\ndistinct names. Furthermore, these systems are often difficult to install\nlocally.\n\nSeqRepo provides an efficient, non-redundant and indexed storage system for\nbiological sequences. Clients refer to sequences and metadata using familiar\nidentifiers, such as NM_000551.3 or GRCh38:1, or any of several hash-based\nidentifiers. The interface supports fast slicing of arbitrary regions of large\nsequences.\n\nA \"fully-qualified\" identifier includes a namespace to disambiguate accessions\nfrom different origins or sequence sets (e.g., \"1\" in GRCh37 and GRCh38). If the\nnamespace is provided, seqrepo uses it as-is; if the namespace is not provided\nand the unqualified identifier refers to a unique sequence, it is returned;\notherwise, the use of ambiguous identifiers raise an error.\n\nSeqRepo favors namespaces from [identifiers.org](https://identifiers.org)\nwhenever available. Examples include\n[refseq](<https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/refseq>) and\n[ensembl](<https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/ensembl>).\n\n[seqrepo-rest-service](https://github.com/biocommons/seqrepo-rest-service) provides a REST interface\nand docker image.\n\nReleased under the Apache License, 2.0.\n\n[![ci_rel](https://travis-ci.org/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo)\n\\|\n[![cov](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/badge.svg?branch=)](https://coveralls.io/github/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo?branch=)\n\\|\n[![pypi_rel](https://badge.fury.io/py/biocommons.seqrepo.png)](https://pypi.org/pypi?name=biocommons.seqrepo)\n\\| [ChangeLog](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/tree/master/docs/changelog/0.5)\n"
