In this case Conda will modify your shell scripts (*~/.bashrc* or *~/.bash_profile*) to initialize Miniconda3 on startup. Ensure that any future modifications to your *$PATH* variable in your shell scripts occur **before** this code to initialize Miniconda3.\n\nAfter installing Conda you will need to add the bioconda channel as well as the other channels bioconda depends on. Start a new console session (e.g. by closing the current window and opening a new one) and run the following:\n```\nconda config --add channels defaults\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\n```\n\nNext, create a dedicated Conda environment to install the [DiMSum bioconda package](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/r-dimsum/README.html) and it's dependencies:\n```\nconda create -n dimsum r-base=4.0 fastqc=0.11 r-dimsum\nconda activate dimsum\n```\n**TIP:** See [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information about managing conda environments.\n\nTo check that you have a working installation of DiMSum, run the [Demo](DEMO.md)\n\n**NOTE:** If you're having [graphics issues](https://github.com/lehner-lab/DiMSum/issues/18), try installing [R Cairo](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/r-cairo) v1.5:\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge r-cairo=1.5\n```\n\n## Installing DiMSum dependencies using Conda\n\nAlternatively, once Conda is installed (or if you already have it) you can install DiMSum dependencies alone by creating a Conda environment from the [dimsum.yaml](../dimsum.yaml) file.\n\nFirstly, clone the DiMSum repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/lehner-lab/DiMSum.git\n```\nThen use it to create the environment for DiMSum dependencies and activate it:\n```\nconda env create -f DiMSum/dimsum.yaml\nconda activate dimsum\n```\n\nOnce DiMSum dependencies have been installed successfully you can then [install DiMSum from source](#installing-dimsum-from-source-github) (you can skip the first step to clone the DiMSum repository).\n\n## Installing DiMSum dependencies manually\n\nInstalling DiMSum dependencies manually is not recommended. The easiest way to install DiMSum (and its dependencies) is by using the [DiMSum bioconda package](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/r-dimsum/README.html). See [Installing DiMSum using Conda](#installing-dimsum-using-conda-recommended).\n\n**REQUIRED:** Before [installing DiMSum from source](#installing-dimsum-from-source-github), please ensure that the following required software is installed:\n\n* **[_R_](https://www.r-project.org/) >=v3.6**\n* **[_Pandoc_](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) >=v1.17.2**\n\nPandoc comes bundled with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and the *pandoc* binary can be found in the RStudio *bin/pandoc* directory.\n\n**OPTIONAL:** Additionally, if raw FASTQ files will be processed (with DiMSum *WRAP*), the following software needs to be installed:\n\n* **[_FastQC_](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) v0.11**\n* **[_Cutadapt_](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) v2.4**\n* **[_VSEARCH_](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) >=v2.17**\n* **[_Starcode_](https://github.com/gui11aume/starcode) v1.3**\n\n**NOTE:** Please ensure that the *$PATH* vairable is set so that these external binaries are available from the command-line prompt. You can add a directory (containing an external binary or symblic link) to your path by adding the following line at the bottom of your *~/.bashrc* or *~/.bash_profile* file:\n```\nexport PATH=EXTERNAL_BINARY_DIRECTORY:$PATH\n```\n\n## Installing DiMSum from source (GitHub)\n\nInstalling DiMSum from source is not recommended. The easiest way to install DiMSum (and its dependencies) is by using the [DiMSum bioconda package](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/r-dimsum/README.html). See [Installing DiMSum using Conda](#installing-dimsum-using-conda-recommended).\n\nBefore installing DiMSum from source, please ensure that the required [software dependencies](#installing-dimsum-dependencies-using-conda) are available.\n\nFirstly, clone the DiMSum repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/lehner-lab/DiMSum.git\n```\nThen, from the same location run R and enter:\n```\nif(!require(devtools)) install.packages(\"devtools\")\n#devtools::install_deps('DiMSum') #Uncomment this line to install DiMSum dependencies\ndevtools::install('DiMSum')\n```\nFinally, add the cloned DiMSum repository base directory to your path. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your *~/.bashrc* or *~/.bash_profile* file:\n```\nexport PATH=CLONED_DIMSUM_REPOSITORY:$PATH\n```\n\n## Demo DiMSum\n\nIn order to test that you have a working installation of the DiMSum pipeline and all necessary software dependencies, run the [Demo](DEMO.md).\n"
