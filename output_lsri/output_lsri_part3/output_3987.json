Details please see the manuals of **[RiboCode](https://github.com/xryanglab/RiboCode)**. This would generate a directory named *RiboCode_annot*, containing some annotation file, for example:\n```\ntranscripts_cds.txt: coordinate file containing transcripts of all protein coding genes.\ntranscripts_sequence.fa: transcript sequences containing all protein coding transcripts.\n```\n\n+ **Prepare the longest transcript annotaion files.**\n```\nOutputTranscriptInfo -c <transcripts_cds.txt> -g <gtfFile.gtf> -f <transcripts_sequence.fa> -o <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -O <all.transcripts.info.txt>\n```\nThis step would generated two files, one is the *longest.transcripts.info.txt*, containing annotation infomation of the longest transcripts of all protein coding genes. And the *all.transcripts.info.txt* containing annotation infomation of all transcripts. The *transcripts_sequence.fa* was generated by *prepare_trascripts*, A function of **[RiboCode](https://github.com/xryanglab/RiboCode)**.\n\n+ **Prepare the sequence file for the longest transcripts**\n```\nGetProteinCodingSequence -i <transcripts_sequence.fa>  -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> --mode whole --table 1 {-l -r -S}\n```\n\nThis step would generate three files. One is the amino acid sequences of the longest transcripts. One is the transcript sequences of the longest transcripts. And the last one is the cds sequences of the longest transcripts. *transcripts_sequence.fa* and *longest.transcripts.info.txt* are generated above. *--table* controls which genetic code we should use, default is the standard. If you want to get sequences of a specific gene set, please reset *-S* parameter. **Notes: -S represents transcripts belong to the longest.transcripts.info.txt**.\n\nSometines, UTR sequences are needed. In this case, *GetUTRSequences* maybe helpful:\n```\nGetUTRSequences -i <input_transcript_sequences.fa> -o <output_prefix> -c <transcripts_cds.txt>\n```\nwhere *input_transcript_sequences.fa* are any transcript sequences you are interested in from  *transcripts_sequence.fa* generated by **[RiboCode](https://github.com/xryanglab/RiboCode)** and *transcripts_cds.txt* are coordinate file generated by **[RiboCode](https://github.com/xryanglab/RiboCode)**.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

        "value": "Quality Control has some basic functions, containing periodicity checking, reads distribution among reading frames,length distribution of ribosome footprints and DNA contamination. **Notes: all BAM files used as following should be sorted and indexed.**\n\n+ **Periodicity checking.**\n\nRibosome profiling data with a good quality tend to have a good 3-nt periodicity.\n\n```\nmetaplots -a <RiboCode_annot> -r <transcript.bam> -o <output_prefix>\n```\nThis is a function of **[RiboCode](https://github.com/xryanglab/RiboCode)**, and it will generated a pdf file with periodicity of ribosome footprint with different length. In this step, users should record the read length and off-set of reads with a good periodicity, and construct a *attributes.txt* file in this format (***Each columns are separated by TAB***):\n\n```\nbamFiles    readLengths Offsets bamLegends\n./SRR5008134.bam    27,28,29,30 11,12,13,14 si-Ctrl-1\n./SRR5008135.bam    27,28,29,30 11,12,13,14 si-Ctrl-2\n./SRR5008136.bam    27,28,29    11,12,13    si-eIF5A-1\n./SRR5008137.bam    27,28,29    11,12,13    si-eIF5A-2\n```\nThe first column is the position and name of your bam files, the second column is the lengths of reads with good periodicity separated by comma, the third column is the off-set separated by comma and the last column is the names of bam file. Also, you could also use the *Periodicity* in this package to do the same thing but without statistics like this:\n\n```\nPeriodicity -i <transcript.bam> -a <RiboCode_annot> -o <output_prefix> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -L 25 -R 35 {-S select_trans.txt --id-type transcript-id}\n```\nThis step would generated a pdf file containing periodicity of reads with different length from 25 to 35. The *transcript.bam* is a bam file mapped to transcriptome. *longest.transcripts.info.txt* is the annotation file generated by *OutputTranscriptInfo*. This function is transplant from **[RiboCode](https://github.com/xryanglab/RiboCode)** but without P-site identification. If the users want to look at the periodicity of a specific gene sets, *-S* and *--id-type* could be helpful, the latter is used for control of id type of input transcript sequence. **Notes: transcripts in select_trans.txt are a subset of genes from the longest.transcripts.info.txt**. And the first column of *select_trans.txt* must be sequence id corresponding with *--id-type* and it must has a column name like:\n\n```\ntrans_id\nENST00000244230\nENST00000552951\nENST00000428040\nENST00000389682\nENST00000271628\n```\n\n+ **Reads distribution among different reading frames.**\n\nIf the ribosome profiling data has a good 3-nt periodicity, the reads of ribosome footprint would be enriched on a specific reading frame. This step is used for  statistics of reads covered on different reading frames.\n```\nRiboDensityOfDiffFrames -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> {-S select_trans.txt --id-type transcript-id --plot yes}\n```\nwhere *attributes.txt* is constructed by users based on the results of periodicity. And *longest.transcripts.info.txt* is generated by *OutputTranscriptInfo* on the step of **Data preparation**. This step would generated two files for each sample, one is the reads distribution plot with *pdf* format and the other is the read numbers of different reading frames for each gene.\n\n\n+ **Length distribution.**\n\nThe length distribution of normal ribosome profiling data is around 28nt~30nt\uff0c any abnormal length distribution maybe represent problems from library construction or sequencing steps. So this is also an important criterian for data with a good quality.\n```\nLengthDistribution -i <sequence_sample.fastq> -o <output_prefix> -f fastq\nor\nLengthDistribution -i <sequence_sample.bam> -o <output_prefix> -f bam\n```\nwhere *sequence_sample.fastq* is the fastq file after adapter trimmed and filtered with sequence quality and *sequence_sample.bam* is the mapping file. This step would generate two files. One is the plot of length distribution with *pdf* format and the other is the length of each sequencing read.\n\nIf users want to display length distribution of reads from differnet regions (CDS, 5'UTR, 3'UTR) or calculate reads length for specific transcripts, ***ReadsLengthOfSpecificRegions*** would be helpful.\n\n```\nusage:\nReadsLengthOfSpecificRegions -i bamFile  -c longest.transcripts.info.txt -o output_prefix --type CDS/5UTR/3UTR { -S transcript_list --id-type transcript_id}\n\n```\n\n+ **DNA contamination.**\n\nSometimes the length distribution of ribosome footprint is biased away from 28nt-30nt, which is the normal length distribution of ribosome profiling data. Therefore, this step aims to statistic numbers of the reads mapped to RNA, DNA, Intron region,and re-check the length distriution of reads mapped to transcriptome.\n\n```\nStatisticReadsOnDNAsContam -i  <genome.bam>  -g <gtfFile.gtf>  -o  <output_prefix>\n```\nwhere *genome.bam* is bam file mapped to genome, *gtfFile.gtf* is the genome annotation file such as *Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.88.gtf*. This step would generated four files, one is the reads distribution of mapped reads <*output_prefix_reads_distribution.txt*>, like this:\n```\nunique mapped reads of exon: 16161306\nunique mapped reads of intergenic region: 36937\nunique mapped reads of intron: 345\nunique mapped ambiguous reads of RNA: 119989\n```\nThe other three are *pdf* files, which are length distribution plot of reads mapped to RNA, DNA, and Intron.  Notes: this step would consume a lot of time, aroumd 10~20 minutes.\n\n+ **Read counting**\n\n```\nUsage:\nModifyHTseq -i bamFile -g gtfFile -o countsFile -t exon -m union -q 10 --minLen 25 --maxLen 35 --exclude-first 45 --exclude-last 15 --id-type gene_id\nNotes: This script only used for strand specific library.\n```\n\n\n"

Therefore it is very important to find out the possible ribosome stalling events along transcripts. Metagene analysis is one of ways to do such things.\n\n+ **Metagene analysis along the whole transcript region.**\n\n```\nMetageneAnalysisForTheWholeRegions -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -b 15,90,60 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --plot yes\n```\n*MetageneAnalysisForTheWholeRegions* is used for metagene analysis along the whole transcript, containing the 5'UTR, CDS, and 3'UTR. The output is a metagene plot with *pdf* format as well as a density file used for metagene plot. *\"-b\"* represents the relative length of 5'UTR,CDS,and 3'UTR, which is separated by comma; *\"-l\"* controls the minimum length of transcripts in codon level, 150 codon in default; *\"-n\"* controls the minimum read density along transcripts in RPKM filtering mode; *\"-e\"* controls numbers of codon that need to be excluded when normalizing the read density with the mean density of a given transcript. *\"-m\"* controls the minimum read density of a given transcript after excluding the first *\"-e\"* codons; *\"--plot\"* controls whether to plot the results.\n\nThis step would generate two files, one is the *output_prefix_metagenePlot_forTheWholeRegions.pdf* and the other is the *output_prefix_scaled_density_dataframe.txt* used for plot, in which each column is a sample and each row is the position along the transcript with length scaled. Users could use *PlotMetageneAnalysisForTheWholeRegions* to plot the read density along the transcript based on *output_prefix_scaled_density_dataframe.txt* file.\n```\nPlotMetageneAnalysisForTheWholeRegions -i <output_prefix_scaled_density_dataframe.txt> -o <output_prefix> -g <group1,group2> -r <group1-rep1,group1-rep2__group2-rep1,group2-rep2> -b 15,90,60 --mode all {--ymin,--ymax}\n```\nwhere *-g* is the group names of samples or conditions which are separated by comma. It is recommmended that the first one is the control group and the next one is treat group. *-r* is the replicate names corresponding to the *-g* as well as *bamLegends* in *attributes.txt* file. Groups are separated by \"__\" and the replicates of one groups are separated by comma. *-b* must be the sample as *-b* in *MetageneAnalysisForTheWholeRegions*. *--mode* controls to output density plot of all samples or just mean density of different replicates.\n\n+ **Metagene analysis on CDS regions.**\n\nThere are three ways of input for this function. The first one is that you can input an *attributes.txt* file which contains all samples including their location, sample name, read length and offset with a *-f* parameter. The second one is that you could input all samples with *-i, -r, -s, -t* parameters, all the information are the same as what are included in *attributes.txt* file. The last one is that you could input the samples one by one  with *-i, -r, -s, -t* parameters and use *MergeSampleDensitys* to merge all the output files.\n```\n## the first way\nMetageneAnalysis -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -u 0 -d 500 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --norm yes -y 100 --CI 0.95 --type CDS\n\n## the second way\nMetageneAnalysis -i ctrl1.bam,ctrl2.bam,treat1.bam,treat2.bam -r 28,29,30_28,29,30_28,29,30_28,29,30 -s 12,12,12_12,12,12_12,12,12_12,12,12 -t ctrl1,ctrl2,treat1,treat2 -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -u 0 -d 500 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --norm yes -y 100 --CI 0.95 --type CDS\n\n## the third way\nMetageneAnalysis -i ctrl1.bam -r 28,29,30 -s 12,12,12 -t ctrl1 -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -u 0 -d 500 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --norm yes -y 100 --CI 0.95 --type CDS\nMetageneAnalysis -i ctrl2.bam -r 28,29,30 -s 12,12,12 -t ctrl2 -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -u 0 -d 500 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --norm yes -y 100 --CI 0.95 --type CDS\nMetageneAnalysis -i treat1.bam -r 28,29,30 -s 12,12,12 -t treat1 -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -u 0 -d 500 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --norm yes -y 100 --CI 0.95 --type CDS\nMetageneAnalysis -i treat2.bam -r 28,29,30 -s 12,12,12 -t treat2 -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -u 0 -d 500 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --norm yes -y 100 --CI 0.95 --type CDS\n\n## merge all the output files generated by the third way\nMergeSampleDensity ctrl1_dataframe.txt,ctrl2_dataframe.txt,treat1_dataframe.txt,treat2_dataframe.txt <output_prefix>\n```\n*MetageneAnalysis* is used for metagene analysis on CDS regions or UTR regions. *\"--type\"* controls CDS or UTR, default CDS; *\"--CI\"* controls confidence intervals of density at each position; *\"--norm\"* controls whether to normalize the read density at each position; *\"-y\"* controls how many codons to output for each transcript; *\"-U\"* and *\"-M\"* controls unit of density calculation and filering mode, respectively; *\"-u\"* and *\"-d\"* controls the range of CDS region relative to start codon or stop codon.\n\nThis step would generate four kind of files. One is *output_prefix_metagenePlot.pdf*, a metagene plot of different samples. One is *output_prefix_transcript_id.txt*, containing all transcripts passed all filtering criteria. One is the *output_prefix_dataframe.txt* which could be used for generating *output_prefix_metagenePlot.pdf* and the last one is *output_prefix_sampleName_codon_density.txt* which is the results of *-y*, containing ribosome density at each codon or nt for each transcript. Also, we offer a script *PlotMetageneAnalysis* to plot the metagene plot like this:\n```\nPlotMetageneAnalysis -i <output_prefix_dataframe.txt> -o <output_prefix> -g <group1,group2> -r <group1-rep1,group1-rep2__group2-rep1,group2-rep2> -u 0 -d 500 -U codon {--format --ymin --ymax --slide-window --axvline --start --window --step --CI}\n```\nwhere *-u* ,*-d* and *-U* must be corresponding to *MetageneAnalysis*. And the *--slide-window*, *--start* and *--window* controls whether to smooth the line with a slide-window average method.\n\n+ **Metagene analysis on UTR regions.**\n\n```\nMetageneAnalysis -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U nt -M RPKM -u 100 -d 100 -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5 --norm yes -y 50 --CI 0.95 --type UTR\n```\nThe output of this step is the same as what you did on **Metagene analysis on CDS regions**\n\n+ **Polarity calculation.**\n\nPolarity values is usually used for judging the ribosome density enriched on 5' end of ORFs or 3' end of ORFs. Values colse to -1, indicating ribosomes enriched more on 3' ORFs and values close to 1, indicating ribosomes enriched more on 5' ORFs.\n```\nPolarityCalculation -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -n 64\n```\n*\"-n\"* controls the minimum read counts of a transcript. And this step would generated a distribution plot of polarity values and could indicate whether ribosomes are enriched or not.\n\nThis step would generate two files. One is the distribution plot of polarity values and the other is the file used for generating the plot. And you could also use a extra script *PlotPolarity* to generate such polarity plot like this:\n```\nPlotPolarity -i <output_prefix_polarity_dataframe.txt> -o output_prefix -g <group1,group2> -r <group1-rep1,group1-rep2__group2-rep1,group2-rep2>  {-y 5}\n```\nThis would generate two plot files. One is the distribution plot of polarity for all samples. And the other is the distribution plot of mean polarity among different replicates.\n"

We should pick those transcripts stalled ribosomes out. The *RiboDensityForSpecificRegion* could be helpful.\n```\nRiboDensityForSpecificRegion -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -L 25 -R 75\n```\nThis would generate a file containing the mean ribosome density on the specific region (codon 25-75) of all the longest transcripts based on which users could pick those transcripts enriched ribosomes out. And later on, users should use the new gene lists to do the metagene analysis again with a *-S* parameter and check is there any difference between different gene lists. In this case, only those transcripts enriched ribosomes on the specific region are ready for downstream analysis.\n\n+ **Ribosome density at each kind of AA or codon.**\n\nThis step would calculate ribosome density at each kind of codon or amino acid (AA) based on which users could compare density among different codons or AAs and check if the ribosome could have kind of preference along the whole transcript.\n```\nRiboDensityAtEachKindAAOrCodon -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -M [counts|RPKM] -S <select_trans.txt> -l 100 -n 10 --table 1 -F <longest_cds_sequence.fa>\n```\nWhere *-S* is the transcripts you are interested in. *-F*  is the cds sequences of the longest transcripts generated by *GetProteinCodingSequence* . **Notes: the first column of the select_trans.txt must be the transcripts and with a column name.**\n\nThe output of this step is a file containing ribosome density at each kind of codon or amino acid like this:\n```\nAA      codon   ctrl-1       ctrl-2       treat-1      treat-2\nK       AAA     0.026594288206047208    0.029364263341463245    0.015578462857160988    0.014649362490996175\nN       AAC     0.023361565164523757    0.025593616862523674    0.025286390202746506    0.025597799715113747\n```\n\nWe can also calculate the ribosome density of each kind of AA or codon at a specific region, for example codon 25-75 by add *-u* and *-d* parameters.\n```\nRiboDensityAtEachKindAAOrCodon -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -M [counts|RPKM] -S <select_trans.txt> -l 100 -n 10 --table 1 -F <longest_cds_sequence.fa> -u 25 -d 75\n```\nThis would generate two files. One is the ribosome density at the specific region (coodn 25-75)----*output_prefix_specific_range_codon_density.txt*, the other is the ribosome density out of this region (codon 75-stop codon)----*output_prefix_rest_range_codon_density.txt*.\n\n+ **Ribosome density on amino acids with positive or negative charge**\n\nOnce you got the ribosome density at each kind of codon or AA, use *PlotRiboDensityAtEachKindAAOrCodon* to plot the density and differences between control groups and treat groups.\n```\nPlotRiboDensityAtEachKindAAOrCodon -i <output_prefix_all_codon_density.txt> -o <output_prefix> -g <group1,group2> -r <group1-rep1,group1-rep2__group2-rep1,group2-rep2> --level AA\n```\nThis step would generate a *pdf* file containing ribosome density at each kind of AA or codon as for each sample. And there is also a density difference plot among control and treat groups at the last page of the file.\n\n+ **Pausing score of each triplete amino acid**.\n\nPausing score of each triplete amino acid is the sum of ribosome density covered on this tri-AA motif. And this kind of pausing score could help us find out those tri-AA motifs which could enrich more ribosome.\n```\nPausingScore -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -M [counts|RPKM] -S <select_trans.txt>  -l 100 -n 10 --table 1 -F  <longest_cds_sequence.fa>\n```\nThe input and parameters are almost the same as *RiboDensityAtEachKindAAOrCodon*. And it could also offer *-L* and *-R* to calculate pausing score of tri-AA motifs at the specific region just like the *-u* and *-d* of *RiboDensityAtEachKindAAOrCodon* did.\n\nThis step would generate a pausing score file as for each sample. In order to pick those tri-AA motifs enriched more ribosomes out, we offer *ProcessPausingScore* to do such job and output an position weight matrix for E,P,A sites of a tri-AA motif which later on could be used for motif logo plot using **[Seq2Logo](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/Seq2Logo-2.1/)** from **[DTU Health Tech](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/)**.\n```\nProcessPausingScore -i <group1-rep1_pausing_score.txt,group1-rep2_pausing_score.txt,group2-rep1_pausing_score.txt,group2-rep2_pausing_score.txt> -o <output_prefix> -g <group1,group2> -r <group1-rep1,group1-rep2__group2-rep1,group2-rep2> --mode [raw|ratio] --ratio_filter 2 --pausing_score_filter 10\n```\nWhere *-i* is the pausing score file we need to input, and all pausing score file should be separated by comma. *--ratio_filter 2* means the FC(treat/ctrl)>=2 and *--pausing_score_filter 10* means pausing score on treat group must be larger than 10. *--mode raw* means input is the raw pausing score generated by  *PausingScore*; *--mode ratio* means input is the processed file with this format:\n```\nmotif\tsi-Ctrl\tsi-eIF5A\tratio\nPPP\t9.583728008472916\t32.40390126709601\t3.3811374069097035\nDDD\t7.864248366516\t18.973658903418116\t2.4126474672650478\nSPP\t5.095062641097612\t14.244816613232201\t2.7958079451921103\nLPP\t6.269550858040044\t13.567581067294325\t2.1640435454631204\nDDP\t3.533105599301455\t13.297017644747527\t3.763549452746766\nAPP\t3.8178063397299846\t11.921477030003814\t3.1225986781841226\n```\n\nAnd the last position weight matrix looks like this:\n```\n        A\tD\tL\tP\tS\n0\t0.14909086080045236\t0.4526622484437558\t0.10332391327033515\t0.16143499003013836\t0.13348798745531829\n1\t0.0\t0.45266224844375585\t0.0\t0.5473377515562442\t0.0\n2\t0.0\t0.1367730692993923\t0.0\t0.8632269307006076\t0.0\n```\nWhere the *0,1,2* represent the E,P,A site of  a tri-AA motif. Using **[Seq2Logo](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/biotools/Seq2Logo/)** for logo plot:\n\n```\n## this tool needs a python2.7 environment\nPATH=/tools/python2:$PATH\nSeq2Logo.py -f <pwm.txt> -u probability -I 5 -o <output_preifx> --format PDF\n```\n+ **Ribosome density around the triplete amino acid (tri-AA) motifs**.\n\n    Now that we have find out tri-AA motifs enriched more ribosomes, we want to know the ribosome density around those tri-AA motifs and check whether there are any differences between the control and treat groups on those motifs.\n\n    + **As for a specific tri-AA motif, such as poly-proline (PPP)**\n\n    ```\n    RiboDensityAroundTripleteAAMotifs -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o PPP -M [RPKM|counts] -S <select_trans.txt> -l 100 -n 10 --table 1 -F <longest_cds_sequence.fa> --type2 PPP --type1 PP\n    ```\n    In this case, it would generate a file named *PPP_motifDensity_dataframe.txt*  which could be used for plot of ribosome density around PPP or NPP motifs using *PlotRiboDensityAroundTriAAMotifs* like this:\n\n    ```\n    PlotRiboDensityAroundTriAAMotifs -i PPP_motifDensity_dataframe.txt -o PPP -g <group1,group2> -r <group1-rep1,group1-rep2__group2-rep1,group2-rep2> --mode mean\n    ```\n\n    + **As for a tri-AA motifs list which contains part of information like this**:\n\n    ```\n    motifs\n    PPP\n    DDD\n    SPP\n    LPP\n    ```\n    Using following command to do such job:\n    ```\n    RiboDensityAroundTripleteAAMotifs -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -M [RPKM|counts] -S <select_trans.txt> -l 100 -n 10 --table 1 -F <longest_cds_sequence.fa> --motifList1 tri_AA_motifs1.txt --motifList2 tri_AA_motifs2.txt\n    ```\n    This would generate a file containing ribosome density of all tri-AA motifs in *tri_AA_motifs1.txt* and *tri_AA_motifs2.txt*. Later on use the same command to plot.\n\n+ **RPFdist calculation**.\n\nRPFdist defines as the ratio of ribosome density on 5'UTR and density on CDS region. And usually it is negatively correlated with translation efficiency (TE).\n```\nRPFdist -f <attributes.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -M [RPKM|counts] -S <select_trans.txt> -l 100 -n 10 -m 1 -e 5\n```\n\n+ **GC contents for sequences with a fasta format**.\n\nThere are two kinds of mode for GC contents calculation. **normal** mode\uff1a calculate GC contents for a given sequence (GC/total). **frames** mode: calculate GC contents of each reading frame for a given sequence.\n```\nGCContent -i <input_sequences.fa> -o <output_prefix> --mode [normal|frames]\n```\nAfter this step, use *PlotGCContent*  to get statistic plot of GC contents for the given sequences.\n```\n## normal mode\nPlotGCContent -i <output_prefix_GC_content.txt> -o <output_prefix> --mode normal\n## frames mode\nPlotGCContent -i <output_prefix_GC_content_frames.txt> -o <output_prefix> --mode frames\n```\n\n+ **Local tRNA adaptation index and global tRNA adaptation index**\n\nThis step would generate two file. One is the file containing the local tAI values at each positon along transcripts and the other contains the global tAI values.\n```\ntAI -i <cds_sequence_1.fa,cds_sequence_2.fa...> -o <output_prefix> -t <geneList1,geneList2...> -u 0 -d 500 --table 1 -N <tRNA_gene_copy_numbers.txt>\n```\nwhere the *tRNA_gene_copy_numbers.txt* is the file downloaded from [GtRNAdb](http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/) with this format:\n```\nChr\ttRNA\tBegin\tEnd\tIsotype\tAnticodon\tUpstream\tDownstream\nchr6\t95\t58141949\t58141877\tAla\tAGC\ttttctccctc\tgtttcttgtc\nchr6\t25\t26751918\t26751990\tAla\tAGC\tagtgtagtgt\tgcttctttta\nchr1\t87\t150017452\t150017382\tAla\tAGC\taagaattaaa\tcaaaggtttt\nchr6\t94\t58142661\t58142589\tAla\tAGC\tagtgtagtgt\tgcttctttta\nchr6\t160\t26773843\t26773771\tAla\tAGC\tatgcggtgtg\tgcttctttta\nchr6\t23\t26728256\t26728328\tAla\tAGC\tatgcggtgtg\tgcttctttta\n```\nwhere the **Anticodon** column is a must. After this step, we could use *tAIPlot* for local tAI plot with:\n```\ntAIPlot -i <output_prefix_tAI_dataframe.txt> -o <output_prefix> -u 0 -d 500 --mode all --start 5 --window 7 --step 1\n```\n\n\n+ **Local codon adaptation index and global codon adaptation index**\n\nAs for CAI calculation, we need a reference sequences to calculate frequency of each codon or relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values from very highly expressed genes of the organism.\n```\ncAI -i <cds_sequence_1.fa,cds_sequence_2.fa...> -o <output_prefix> -t <geneList1,geneList2...> -u 0 -d 500 [--RSCU <RSUCs.txt> | --reference <references.fa> | --weight <weight.txt>]\n```\nWhere *-i* are the input sequences with *fasta* format separated by comma. *-t* are the sequence lengends corresponding to the input sequences. *--reference* is a reference sequences highly expressed in a specific organism. *--RSCU and --weight* are weight files containing weight of each codon.  And this step would generate two files. One is the local cAI,and the other is the global codon adaptation index. Part codes were from [CAI](https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/CodonAdaptationIndex) package developed by [Lee, B. D](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00905).\n\nAfter this step, we could use *cAIPlot* to plot the local cAI values with a metagene method.\n```\ncAIPlot -i <output_prefix_local_cAI_dataframe.txt> -o <output_prefix> -u 0 -d 500 --mode all --start 5 --window 7 --step 1\n```\n\nNotice that the cds sequences for a specific gene list could be generated by *GetProteinCodingSequence* like:\n\n```\nGetProteinCodingSequence -i <transcrits_sequence.fa> -c <longest.trans.info.txt> -S <select_trans.txt> -o <output_prefix> --mode whole --table 1 --id-type transcript-id\n```\n\n+ **Hydrophobicity calculation and Charge amino acids**\n\n*hydropathyCharge* could be used for hydrophobicity calculation as well as charges of amino acid by set *--index* to a related index file.\n```\n## hydrophobicity calculation\nhydropathyCharge  -i <cds_sequence_1.fa,cds_sequence_2.fa...> -o <output_prefix> -t <geneList1,geneList2...> --index <hydrophobicity_index.txt> -u 0 -d 500 --table 1\n##\nhydropathyCharge  -i <cds_sequence_1.fa,cds_sequence_2.fa...> -o <output_prefix> -t <geneList1,geneList2...> --index <charge_index.txt> -u 0 -d 500 --table 1\n```\nthe both index file looks like:\n```\n## hydrophobicity index download from AAindex\nAA\tamio_acids\thydropathy\nA\tAla \t1.8\nR\tArg \t-4.5\nN\tAsn \t-3.5\nD\tAsp \t-3.5\nC\tCys \t2.5\n...\n## charge index\nAA\tamio_acids\tcharge\nA\tAla \t0\nR\tArg \t1\nN\tAsn \t0\nD\tAsp \t-1\nC\tCys \t0\nQ\tGln \t0\nE\tGlu \t-1\nG\tGly \t0\nH\tHis \t1\n...\n```\namong which the hydrophobicity index are downloaded from [AAindex](https://www.genome.jp/aaindex/). Later on, use *PlotHydropathyCharge* for plot:\n```\n## hydrophobicity\nPlotHydropathyCharge -i <output_prefix_hydropathy_dataframe.txt> -o <output_prefix> -u 0 -d 500 --mode all --ylab \"Average Hydrophobicity\"\n## charge\nPlotHydropathyCharge -i <output_prefix_charge_values_dataframe.txt> -o <output_prefix> -u 0 -d 500 --mode all --ylab \"Average Charges\"\n```\n"

Therefore, there are two input files for this step. One is the total translatome file and the other is the IP translatome file. The enrichment analysis contains four steps:\n\n+ **Step 1: Calculate ribosome density at each position for each transcript**.\n```\nRiboDensityAtEachPosition -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -f <attributes.txt> -o <output_prefix>  -U [codon|nt]\n```\nwhere *attributes.txt* and *longest.transcripts.info.txt* are files we have talked above. This step would generate two files for each sample. One is the ribosome density file which would be used for following analysis. The Other is the coverage file, containing coverage of each transcript on CDS region.\n\n+ **Step 2: Calculate mean ribosome density for different replicates**.\n```\nenrichmentMeanDensity -i rep1-density.txt,rep2-density.txt,rep3-density.txt -o <output_prefix>\n```\n*-i*  represents ribosome density files of different replicates generated by *RiboDensityAtEachPosition*, which should be separated by comma. This would generate a mean density file for each sample like *output_prefix_mean_density.txt*, used for enrichment analysis. If there is no replicates, just pass this step.\n\n+ **Step 3: Enrichment analysis**.\n```\n## all transcripts\nEnrichmentAnalysis --ctrl <total-translatome.txt> --treat <IP-translatome.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -l 150 -n 10 -m 1 -e 30 --CI 0.95 -u 0 -d 500\n\n## specific transcripts\nEnrichmentAnalysis --ctrl <total-translatome.txt> --treat <IP-translatome.txt> -c <longest.transcripts.info.txt> -o <output_prefix> -U codon -M RPKM -l 150 -n 10 -m 1 -e 30 --CI 0.95 -u 0 -d 500 -S <select_trans.txt>\n```\nWhere *--ctrl* represents ribosome density for total translatome sample and *--treat* represents ribosome density for IP translatome sample, both of which could be generated by *RiboDensityAtEachPosition* in **Step 1** or **Step 2**. This step would generate three files. One is the *output_prefix_enrichment_dataframe.txt* used for plot. One is the *output_prefix_enrichment_transcript_id.txt*, representing transcripts that passed the filtering criteria. And the last one is *output_prefix_ratio.txt*, representing enrichment ratio at each position for those transcripts passed filtering criteria.\n\n+ **Step 4: Plot the enrichment ratio**.\n```\nPlotEnrichmentRatio -i <enrichment_dataframe.txt> -o <output_prefix> -u 0 -d 500 --unit codon --mode all {--slide-window y --axvline 1 --axhline 60 --label legend_label}\n```\nwhere *enrichment_dataframe.txt* was generated by *EnrichmentAnalysis* in **Step 3**. *--slide-window y* controls whether to smooth the curves with the slide-average method or not.\n\n+ **Notes: if you want to see the enrichment ratio for a single transcript, the *EnrichmentAnalysisForSingleTrans* would be helpful**.\n```\nEnrichmentAnalysisForSingleTrans -i <output_prefix_codon_ratio.txt> -s <transcript_name> -o <output_prefix> -c <longest.trans.info.txt>  --id-type transcript_id --slide-window y --axhline 1\n```\nwhere the *output_prefix_codon_ratio.txt* was generated by *EnrichmentAnalysis* in **Step 3**; *transcript_name* is the single transcript you are interested in, and either transcript id or gene name or gene id for that transcript was required.This step would generate a plot file with *pdf* format. And if you set *-S* rather than *-s* with a transcript list file input, the output file would be a *pdf* file containing plots for each transcript.\n"
