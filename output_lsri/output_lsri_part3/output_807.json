        "value": "There are two types of dataset in [B3DB](B3DB), [regression data](B3DB/B3DB_regression.tsv)\nand [classification data](B3DB/B3DB_classification.tsv) and they can be loaded simply using *pandas*. For example\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# load regression dataset\nregression_data = pd.read_csv(\"B3DB/B3DB_regression.tsv\",\n                              sep=\"\\t\")\n\n# load classification dataset\nclassification_data = pd.read_csv(\"B3DB/B3DB_classification.tsv\",\n                                  sep=\"\\t\")\n\n# load extended regression dataset\nregression_data_extended = pd.read_csv(\"B3DB/B3DB_regression_extended.tsv.gz\", \n                                       sep=\"\\t\", compression=\"gzip\")\n\n# load extended classification dataset\nclassification_data_extended = pd.read_csv(\"B3DB/B3DB_classification_extended.tsv.gz\",\n                                           sep=\"\\t\", compression=\"gzip\")\n\n```\n\nWe also have three examples to show how to use our dataset, \n[numerical_data_analysis.ipynb](notebooks/numerical_data_analysis.ipynb), \n[PCA_projection_fingerprint.ipynb](notebooks/PCA_projection_fingerprint.ipynb) and \n[PCA_projection_descriptors.ipynb](notebooks/PCA_projection_descriptors.ipynb). \n[PCA_projection_descriptors.ipynb](notebooks/PCA_projection_descriptors.ipynb) uses precomputed \nchemical descriptors for visualization of chemical space of `B3DB`, and can be used directly\nusing *MyBinder*,\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/theochem/B3DB/main?filepath=notebooks%2FPCA_projection_descriptors.ipynb).\nDue to the difficulty of installing `RDKit` in *MyBinder*, only `PCA_projection_descriptors.\nipynb` is set up in *MyBinder*.\n"
