        "value": "Developed by Luk\u00e1\u0161 Pek\u00e1rek and Stefan Buck at the Helmholtz Institute for RNA-based Infection Research \nin the research group REMI - Recoding Mechanisms in Infections. \nThis script processes Force-Distance Optical Tweezers data in an automated way, to find unfolding events,  \nperform fitting of polymer models and calculate the work applied onto the structure. \nThe script is developed to handle h5 raw data, produced by the C-Trap OT instrument from LUMICKS, \nas well as any other FD data prepared in a CSV file (2 columns: Force(pN) - Distance(um or nm)) \nTo avoid issues with different python package versions, or to avoid setting up an appropriate environment, an executable POTATO version is available.  \nThere is also a standalone executable POTATO version for Windows available. \nThe POTATO GUI is structured in five tabs: \"Folder Analysis\", \"Show Single File\", \"Constant Force Analysis\", \"Advanced Settings\"and \"TOMATO - Manual analysis\".\nFor each analysis step, buttons are displayed in the different tabs and some of them can also be found in the drop-down menu. \nIn this tab, all force ramp experimental files in the specified folder will be analyzed automatically. \nPOTATO supports three different input formats for folder analysis.\nThe appropriate dataset has to be selected prior to the analysis.\nATTENTION: When changing between input formats, all parameters are reset to the default values! \n1) High frequency (Piezo Distance):\n      Analyses the high frequency data (Piezo tracking) of all h5 files in a given directory.\n      The data gathering frequency is derived directly out of the h5 files.\n2) Low Frequency:\n      Analyses the low frequency data of all h5 files in a given directory.\n      The data gathering frequency is calculated directly out of the h5 files.\n3) CSV (F/D):\n      Analyses all csv files in a given directory.\n      The architecture of these files need to consist out of two columns (Force and Distance) without headers.\n      Force needs to be in pN. Distance can be either be in \u00b5m or nm.\n      The script can process forward (unfolding) as well as reverse (folding) curves. If the script should distinguish,\n      the reverse curves need to start with the highest distance and decrease from there.\n      The data gathering frequency and all other parameters are derived from the user input in the GUI. \nParameters can be changed directly in the Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nFor more setting options refer to the \"Advanced Settings\" tab, which includes all adjustable parameters.\nWhen the parameters are optimized, default parameters can be changed in the POTATO_config file,\nso they will be loaded when the GUI is started.\nThe parameters are read in once the analysis starts and for the force-ramp analysis the used parameters are exported in json format. \n**Output**\n  POTATO creates an \"Analysis\" folder with timestamp in the analysed directory.\n\tThe \"Refresh\" button loads the last saved image and displays the progress in the GUI.\n\tIn the \"Advanced Settings\" tab, several export settings can be set. \n1) Processed FD data:\n      Exports the down-sampled and filtered Force-Distance-Array in CSV format.\n      The exported filename consists of the original filename and additional suffix \"_smooth\".\n2) Plot:\n      Exports a figure (PNG) containing - the visualized processed data with and without marked unfolding events\n                                        - the corresponding force- and distance derivatives\n3) Steps found:\n      Exports the identified steps for each curve into a separate CSV file.\n      The step length does NOT correspond to the contour length change, but is only the distance difference between step start and step end.\n4) Fitting:\n      Exports a plot with the fitted models and a table of the fitting parameters for each section in CSV format.\n      When 'Fitting' is not selected, the script skips all fitting steps and therefore the analysis is much faster.\n4) Total results:\n      Exports all found steps for all analysed files to a single CSV file. \n**Input**\n  \nSingle FD-curves of all three input formats (h5-HF, h5-LF, CSV) can be displayed. \nA FD-curve of the original input values, as well as the down sampled values are plotted in the GUI. This may help identify potential causes of errors. \n  \n**Input**\n  \nFirst the constant force marker should be displayed in a time-distance plot with adjacent histogram (Button -> Display Constant Force Data).\nAll three input formats (h5-HF, h5-LF, CSV) are supported.\nAfter providing an initial guess of the fitting parameters, the histogram of the same file can be fitted with gaussians (Button -> Fit Constant Force Data). \n**Parameters**\n  \nThe down sample and filtering parameters are applied also onto the constant force data.\nThis can have a huge impact on the displayed plot.\nFurthermore, the axes have to be set manually and the fitting parameters have to be guessed (dependent on the # of expected gaussians).\nTo guess the fitting parameters, they are entered from lowest to highest values, separated with a comma. \n**Output**\n  \nPOTATO creates an \"Analysis_constantF\" folder with timestamp in the analysed directory.\nBoth, the time-distance plot and the fitted histogram are exported as separate figures in PNG format.\nIn addition, the smoothened values as well as the histogram distribution are exported into CSV files.\nLast, a table with values of the fitted parameters is exported in CSV format. \nThis tab contains all the adjustable parameters in the POTATO.\nThe parameters are divided into several groups based on the part of analysis, in which they are used.\n  \n**Preprocessing**\n  \nDownsample rate - Only every nth value is taken for analysis; speeds up subsequent processing.\n  \nButterworth Filter degree - Defines the stringency of the filter.\n  \nCut off frequency  - Signals with a frequency above this threshold are suppressed.\n \nForce threshold, pN - Values with lower force are excluded from the analysis.\n  \n**Derivative**\n  \nStep d - Characterizes the interval between two values used for numerical derivative calculation.\n  \nData frequency, Hz - The frequency at which data is recorded.\n  \n**Statistics**\n  \nz-score force/distance - The number of standard deviations used to determine whether a given value is part of a normal distribution.\n  \nmoving median window size - The number of values considered for each median calculation. Can be set independently for force and distance\n  \nSD difference threshold - Statistical analysis and data sorting are iterated until the difference between two consecutive SDs is below this value.\n  \n**Fitting**\n  \n\"WLC+WLC\" or \"WLC+FJC\" tick option - determines whether the unfolded regions of FD curves will be fitted with model combining two WLC models or WLC and FJC models, repectively.\n  \ndsLp, nm - Persistence length of the double-stranded (folded) part of the tethered construct. \ndsLc, nm - Contour length of double-stranded (folded) part of the tethered construct. \ndsK0, pN - Stretch modulus of double-stranded (folded) part of the tethered construct. \nForce_offset, pN - Force offset of a given dataset; compensates for a shift in the dataset. \nDistance_offset, nm - Distance offset of a given dataset; compensates for a shift in the dataset. \nssLp, nm - Persistence length of the single-stranded (unfolded) part of the tethered construct. \nssLc, nm - Contour length of single-stranded (unfolded) part of the tethered construct. \nssK0, pN - Stretch modulus of single-stranded (unfolded) part of the tethered construct. \n**Export**\n  \nConsists of tick options for marking the data files to be exported (ticked) or not (unticked) during the analysis. \nProcessed FD data \t- Exports the down-sampled and filtered Force-Distance-Array in CSV format.The exported filename consists of the original filename and additional suffix \"_smooth\". \nPlot\t\t\t- Exports a figure (PNG) containing - the visualized processed data with and without marked unfolding events\n                                                - the corresponding force- and distance derivatives \nSteps found \t\t- Exports the identified steps for each curve into a separate CSV file.\n              The step length does NOT correspond to the contour length change, but is only the distance difference between step start and step end. \nFitting \t\t- Exports a plot with the fitted models and a table of the fitting parameters for each section in CSV format.\n              When 'Fitting' is not selected, the script skips all fitting steps and therefore the analysis is much faster. \nThis tab allows user to perform manual analysis of the FD curves. TOMATO uses the same input parameters as POTATO.\n1) Choose the folder containing the curves to analyse with the \"Choose folder\" button. Attention the file format and preprocessing values are set in the \"Analysis folder\" tab.\n\t\n2) Manually mark the start and end of each (un)folding step: \n\t- press \"s\" or click on \"Set start\" button --> click on the position of start of a step\n\t- press \"e\" or click on \"Set end\" button --> click on the position of end of the same step\n\t- press \"ctrl+s\" or click on \"Save step\" button to save marked step coordinates\n\trepeat until all steps are marked. Attention, the steps have to be marked in the correct order from the \"lowest\" to the \"highest\" step.\n\t- if a mistake occurs during the marking, the last saved value can be removed by the \"Delete step\" button.\n3) Click on \"Analyze curve\" \n\tTOMATO proceeds with step coordinates input and performes the rest analysis as done by POTATO (fitting + work calculations). This may take some time during which the GUI is unresponsive. Optimize fitting parameters until a good fit is obtained. Entries of bad fits can be deleted in the \"results table\" by selecting them and pressing \"Delete\"\n\tThe relevant parameters are loaded into the table below the figure. The column width can be adjusted to see the parameter labels.\n4) Switch to the next curve of the folder with the arrow keys (left, right) or press \"a\" or \"d\". The \"step table\" will be reseted. Analysis is performed as explained above and the parameters are added to the \"results table\". \n5) When all curves are manually analysed, the results table can be saved as csv file with the \"Save results table\" button.\n \n"
