        "value": "This repository contains the quantum chemical properties, including geometries, natural atomic charges and Wiberg bond orders of the 108k transition metal complexes (TMCs) in the last version of the **tmQM** dataset. This collection includes all 30 transition metals across the 3d, 4d and 5d series, combined with more than 30k different ligands. \nThe **tmQM** dataset contains organometallic, bioinorganic, and Werner complexes. Structures were extracted from the 2024 release of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) with a series of filters, yielding mononuclear TMCs with charges in the range [-1, 0, 1]. Electronic structure properties, including the energy, dipole moment, polarizability, and HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, were all computed for the closed-shell singlet state. Two levels of theory were used: GFN2-xTB (geometries) and DFT (single-point properties). \nThe 2024 version of the **tmQM** dataset is an extension of the original **tmQM** dataset reported in this article: [The tmQM Dataset - Quantum Geometries and Properties of 86k Transition Metal Complexes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c01041). **tmQM** has also been used to derive a 60k graph dataset ([**tmQMg**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/dd/d2dd00129b)) and a 30k ligand library ([**tmQMg-L**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00616-5)), both derived from NBO analysis. \nThe purpose of **tmQM** is to provide the scientific community with a reliable source for developing and testing machine learning models for the exploration of the TMC chemical space. \n"

However, not all 0.5M transition metal-containing structures are suited for **tmQM**. TMCs were thus selected and curated using these filters:\n- **Chemical composition filter:** Mononuclear TMCs including any of the 30 transition metals bonded to any of these elements: B, C, Si, N, P, As, O, S, Se, F, Cl, Br, and I, and including at least one C atom.\n- **Geometry filters (I):** Non-polymeric and with 3D coordinates available, excluding disordered structures.\n- **Geometry filters (II):** Heaviest fragment with a transition metal; excludes co-crystalizing molecules (_e.g._, solvents and counterions). \n- **Electronic structure filters:** Neutral and \u00b11 charged TMCs with an even number of electrons. \n- **Curation filter (I):** Only the TMCs for which both the xTB and DFT calculations converged. \n- **Curation filter (II):** The 7% TMCs with the largest deviation of the xTB geometry relative to the CSD structure were excluded (normalized by _r_ factor and number of atoms). \n- **Curation filter (III):** xTB-optimized geometries without any H atom, or with C atoms with missing Hs, were excluded using the filter developed by Ulissi and Blau in [this article](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01226). \n"
