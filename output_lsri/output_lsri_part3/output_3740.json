        "description": "This update introduces a new datastructure based on [awkward arrays](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/).\r\nThe new datastructure is described in more detail [in the documentation](https://scverse.org/scirpy/tags/v0.13.0rc1/data-structure.html) and is considered the \"official\" way of representing AIRR data for scverse core and ecosystem packages. \r\n\r\nBenefits of the new data structure include:\r\n * a more natural, lossless representation of [AIRR Rearrangement data](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/datarep/rearrangements.html)\r\n * separation of AIRR data and the [receptor model](https://scverse.org/scirpy/tags/v0.13.0rc1/ir-biology.html), thereby getting rid of previous limitations (e.g. \"only productive chains\") and enabling other use-cases (e.g. spatial AIRR data) in the future. \r\n * clean `adata.obs` as AIRR data is not expanded into columns\r\n * support for [MuData](https://mudata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for working with paired gene expression and AIRR data as separate modalities.\r\n \r\nThe overall workflow stays the same, however this update required several backwards-incompatible changes which are summarized below. \r\n\r\n## Backwards-incompatible changes \r\n\r\n### New data structure\r\nCloses issue https://github.com/scverse/scirpy/issues/327.\r\n\r\nChanged behavior:\r\n * there are no \"has_ir\" and \"multichain\" columns in `adata.obs` anymore\r\n * By default all fields are imported from AIRR rearrangement and 10x data. \r\n * The restriction that all chains added to an `AirrCell` must have the same fields has been removed. Missing fields are automatically filled with missing values. \r\n * `io.upgrade_schema` can update from v0.7 to v0.13 schema. AnnData objects generated with scirpy `<= 0.6.x` cannot be read anymore. \r\n * `pl.spectratype` now has a `chain` attributed and the meaning of the `cdr3_col` attribute has changed. \r\n\r\nNew functions:\r\n * `pp.index_chains`\r\n * `pp.merge_chains`\r\n\r\nRemoved functions: \r\n * `pp.merge_with_ir`\r\n * `pp.merge_airr_chains`\r\n\r\n\r\n### API supporting MuData\r\nCloses issue https://github.com/scverse/scirpy/issues/383\r\n\r\nAll functions take (where applicable) the additional, optional keyword arguments\r\n * `airr_mod`: the modality in MuData that contains AIRR information (default: \"airr\")\r\n * `airr_key`: the slot in `adata.obsm` that contains AIRR rearrangement data (default: \"airr\")\r\n * `chain_idx_key`: the slot in `adata.obsm` that contains indices specifying which chains in `adata.obsm[airr_key]` are the primary/secondary chains etc. \r\n\r\nNew class:\r\n * `util.DataHandler`\r\n\r\n### Updated example datasets\r\n\r\nThe example datasets have been updated to be based on the new datastructure and are now based on MuData. \r\n\r\n * The example datasets have been regenerated from scratch using the loader notebooks described in the docstring. The Maynard dataset gene expression is now based on values generated with Salmon instead of RSEM/featurecounts.\r\n * Scirpy now uses [pooch](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch) to manage example datasets. \r\n\r\n### Cleanup\r\n\r\n * Removed the deprecated functions `io.from_tcr_objs`, `io.from_ir_objs`, `io.to_ir_objs`, `pp.merge_with_tcr`, `pp.tcr_neighbors`, `pp.ir_neighbors`, `tl.chain_pairing`\r\n * Removed the deprecated classes `TcrCell`, `AirrChain`, `TcrChain`\r\n * Removed the function `pl.cdr_convergence` which was never public anyway. \r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n\r\n### Easy-access functions (`scirpy.get`)\r\nCloses issue https://github.com/scverse/scirpy/issues/184\r\n\r\nNew functions:\r\n * `get.airr`\r\n * `get.obs_context`\r\n * `get.airr_context`\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n * Several type hints that were previously inaccurate are now updated. \r\n * Fix x-axis labelling in `pl.clonotype_overlap` raises an error if row annotations are not unique for each group. \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nThe documentation has been updated to reflect the changes described above, in particular the [tutorials](https://scverse.org/scirpy/tags/v0.13.0rc1/tutorials.html) and the page about the [data structure](https://scverse.org/scirpy/tags/v0.13.0rc1/data-structure.html). \r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n * The minimum required Python version is now 3.8 (#381)\r\n * Increased the minium version of tqdm to 4.63 (See https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm/issues/1082)\r\n * `pl.repertoire_overlap` now *always* runs `tl.repertoire_overlap` internally and doesn't rely on cached values. \r\n * The mode `dendro_only` in `pl.repertoire_overlap` has been removed. \r\n * Cells that have a receptor, but no CDR3 sequence have previously received a separate clonotype in `tl.define_clonotypes`. Now they are receiving no clonotype (i.e. `np.nan`) as do cells without a receptor. \r\n * The function `tl.clonal_expansion` now returns a `pd.Series` instead of a `np.array` with `inplace=False`\r\n * Removed deprecation for `clonotype_imbalanced`, see https://github.com/scverse/scirpy/issues/330\r\n * The `group_abundance` tool and plotting function used `has_ir` as a default group as we could previously rely on this column being present. With the new datastructure, this is not the case. To no break old code, the `has_ir` column is tempoarily added when requested. The `group_abundance` function will have to be rewritten enitrely in the future, see https://github.com/scverse/scirpy/issues/232\r\n * In `pl.spectratype`, the parameter `groupby` has been replaced by `chain`. \r\n * We now use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to organize imports. \r\n * Static typing has been improved internally (using pylance). It's not perfectly consistent yet, but we will keep working on this in the future. ",

        "description": "This update features a\r\n * change of Scirpy's data structure to improve interoperability with the AIRR standard\r\n * a complete re-write of the clonotype definition module for improved performance. \r\n\r\nThis required several backwards-incompatible changes. Please read the release notes below and the updated tutorials. \r\n\r\n## Backwards-incompatible changes\r\n\r\n### Improve Interoperability by fully supporting the AIRR standard (#241)\r\n\r\nScirpy stores receptor information in `adata.obs`. In this release, we updated the column names to match the [AIRR Rearrangement standard](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/datarep/rearrangements.html#productive). Our data model is now much more flexible, allowing to import arbitrary immune-receptor (IR)-chain related information. Use `scirpy.io.upgrade_schema()` to update existing `AnnData` objects to the latest format. \r\n\r\nClosed issues #240, #253, #258, #255, #242, #215.  \r\n\r\nThis update includes the following changes: \r\n * `IrCell` is now replaced by `AirrCell` which has additional functionality\r\n * `IrChain` has been removed. Use a plain dictionary instead. \r\n * CDR3 information is now read from the `junction` and `junction_aa` columns instead of `cdr3_nt` and `cdr3`, respectively. \r\n * Clonotype assignments are now per default stored in the `clone_id` column. \r\n * `expr` and `expr_raw` are now `duplicate_count` and `consensus_count`. \r\n * `{v,d,j,c}_gene` is now `{v,d,j,c}_call`. \r\n * There's now an `extra_chains` column containing all IR-chains that don't fit into our [receptor model](https://icbi-lab.github.io/scirpy/ir-biology.html#receptor-model). These chains are not used by scirpy, but can be re-exported to different formats. \r\n * `merge_with_ir` is now split up into `merge_with_ir` (to merge IR data with transcriptomics data) and `merge_airr_chains` (to merge several adatas with IR information, e.g. BCR and TCR data). \r\n * Tutorial and documentation updates, to reflect these changes\r\n * Sequences are not converted to upper case on import. Scirpy tools that consume the sequences convert them to upper case on-the-fly. \r\n * `{to,from}_ir_objs` has been renamed to `{to,from}_airr_cells`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Refactor CDR3 network creation (#230)\r\n\r\nPreviously, `pp.ir_neighbors` constructed a `cell x cell` network based on clonotype similarity. This led to performance issues\r\nwith highly expanded clonotypes (i.e. thousands of cells with exactly the same receptor configuration). Such cells would \r\nform dense blocks in the sparse adjacency matrix (see issue #217). Another downside was that expensive alignment-distances had \r\nto be recomputed every time the parameters of `ir_neighbors` was changed. \r\n\r\nThe new implementation computes distances between all *unique receptor configurations*, only considering one instance of highly expanded clonotypes. \r\n\r\nClosed issues #243, #217, #191, #192, #164. \r\n\r\nThis update includes the following changes: \r\n * `pp.ir_neighbors` has been replaced by `pp.ir_dist`. \r\n * The options `receptor_arms` and `dual_ir` have been moved from `pp.ir_neighbors` to `tl.define_clonotypes` and `tl.define_clonotype_clusters`. \r\n * The default key for clonotype clusters is now `cc_{distance}_{metric}` instead of `ct_cluster_{distance}_{metric}`. \r\n * `same_v_gene` now fully respects the options `dual_ir` and `receptor_arms`\r\n * v-genes and receptor types were previously simply appended to clonotype ids (when `same_v_gene=True`). Now clonotypes with different v-genes get assigned a different numeric id. \r\n * Distance metric classes have been moved from `ir_dist` to `ir_dist.metrics`. \r\n * Distances matrices generated by `ir_dist` are now square and symmetric instead of triangular. \r\n * The default value for `dual_ir` is now `any` instead of `primary_only` (Closes #164). \r\n * The API of `clonotype_network` has changed. \r\n * Clonotype network now visualizes cells with identical receptor configurations. The number of cells with identical receptor configurations is shown as point size (and optionally, as color). Clonotype network does not support plotting multiple colors at the same time any more. \r\n\r\n| Clonotype network (previous implementation) | Clonotype network (now) |\r\n| ------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\r\n| Each dot represents a cell. Cells with identical receptors form a fully connected subnetwork | Each dot represents cells with identical receptors. The dot size refers to the number of cells | \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7051479/114389098-dff87800-9b94-11eb-8dd8-cc406024eaa6.png) | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7051479/114389105-e2f36880-9b94-11eb-9a58-68a09e67efe7.png) |\r\n\r\n### Drop Support for Python 3.6\r\n\r\n * Support Python 3.9, drop support for Python 3.6, following the numpy guidelines. (#229)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n * `tl.clonal_expansion` and `tl.clonotype_convergence` now respect cells with missing receptors and return `nan` for those cells. (#252)\r\n\r\n## Additions\r\n * `util.graph.igraph_from_sparse_matrix` allows to convert a sparse connectivity or distance matrix to an `igraph` object. \r\n * `ir_dist.sequence_dist` now also works sequence arrays that contain duplicate entries (#192)\r\n * `from_dandelion` and `to_dandelion` facilitate interaction with the [Dandelion package](https://github.com/zktuong/dandelion) (#240)\r\n * `write_airr` allows to write scirpy's `adata.obs` back to the [AIRR Rearrangement format](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/latest/datarep/rearrangements.html). \r\n * `read_airr` now tries to infer the locus from gene names, if no locus column is present. \r\n * `ir.io.upgrade_schema` allows to upgrade an existing scirpy anndata object to be compatible with the latest version of scirpy\r\n * `define_clonotypes` and `define_clonotype_clusters` now prints a logging message indicating where the results have been stored (#215)\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n * `tqdm` now uses IPython widgets to display progress bars, if available\r\n * the `process_map` from `tqdm` is now used to display progress bars for parallel computations instead the custom implementation used previously [f307c2b](https://github.com/icbi-lab/scirpy/pull/230/commits/f307c2b9a6a5b3e86ca0399b6142490d15511177)\r\n * `matplotlib`s \"grid lines\" are now suppressed by default in all plots. \r\n * Docs from the `master` branch are now deployed to `icbi-lab.github.io/scirpy/develop` instead of the main documentation website. The main website only gets updated on releases. \r\n * Refactored the `_is_na` function that checks if a string evaluates to `None`. \r\n * Fixed outdated documentation of the `receptor_arms` parameter (#264)",

        "description": "## Add support for BCRs and gamma-delta TCRs\r\n\r\n### Backwards-incompatible changes:\r\n * The [data structure](https://icbi-lab.github.io/scirpy/usage-principles.html#data-structure) has changed. Column have been renamed from `TRA_xxx` and `TRB_xxx` to `IR_VJ_xxx` and `IR_VDJ_xxx`. Additionally a `locus` column has been added for each chain. \r\n * All occurences of `tcr` in the function and class names have been replaced with `ir`. Aliases for the old names have been created and emit a `FutureWarning`. \r\n \r\n\r\n### Additions: \r\n * There's now a mixed TCR/BCR example dataset (`maynard2020`) available  (#211) \r\n * BCR-related amendments to the documentation (#206)\r\n * `tl.chain_qc` which supersedes `chain_pairing`. It additionally provides information about the receptor type. \r\n * `io.read_tracer` now supports gamma-delta T-cells (#207) \r\n * `io.to_ir_objs` allows to convert adata to a list of `IrCells` (#210)\r\n * `io.read_bracer` allows to read-in BraCeR BCR data. (#208)\r\n * The `pp.merge_with_ir` function now can handle the case when both the left and the right `AnnData` object contain immune receptor information. This is useful when integrating both TCR and BCR data into the same dataset. (#210)\r\n\r\n### Fixes:\r\n * Fix a bug in `vdj_usage` which has been triggered by the new data structure (#203)\r\n \r\n### Minor changes:\r\n\r\n * Removed the tqdm monkey patch, as the issue has been resolved upstream (#200)\r\n * Add AIRR badge, as scirpy is now certified to comply with the AIRR software standard v1. (#202)\r\n * Require pycairo >1.20 which provides a windows wheel, eliminating the CI problems. \r\n \r\n",
