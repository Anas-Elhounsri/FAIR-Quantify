        "value": "- Do I need to know Python to use AutoGraph?\n  No, you can run the program interactively, with the program walking you through the necessary inputs. Refer to the Quick Start Guide \n- Why can't I cluster the conformers saved as PDB files?\n  The variability in PDB file format limits the deployment of AutoGraph on all PDB files. Please consider drafting a script to convert your PDB file to XYZ files to perform AutoGraph. Run AutoGraph with copy_conformers = False. Then use the cluster_summary.csv saved in the output directory to inform your downstream use of clustered conformers\n- Why do I get different clustering results depending on the iteration?\n  The Louvain algorithm used for clustering is deterministic, yet the result depends on file order (https://arxiv.org/pdf/0803.0476.pdf). A change in file order may result in a change in clustering result.\n- I want to take the average over the AutoGraph output iterated over several randomization.\n  Call the AutoGraph function inside a loop. Multiple calls, however, may duplicate files in the outputs or overwrite summary files. Therefore, specify copy_conformers=False in the function, and rename the output files (e.g. \"cluster_summary.csv\" -> \"iter3_cluster_summary.csv\") between calls. Also, consider specifying silence=True in the argument to avoid crowding the screen\n- The clustering terminates with an error when finding the threshold weight.\n  If the values for weights in the affinity matrix are too small, even the complete graph is registered as empty.\n- Can I run AutoGraph on protein conformations?\n  Yes. You may want to extract the backbone atoms only and save files in a dedicated directory as PDB file (e.g. >>> grep 'CA' original1.pdb > backbone/extracted1.pdb ). Be sure all atoms are consistent between all files. Then run AutoGraph on the files in the directory containing only backbone atoms. Please know the performance of AutoGraph has only been validated for metabolites.\n- Can I run AutoGraph on protein-protein complexes?\n  With some work, yes. AutoGraph computes an atomic RMSD matrix based on superimposing all atoms, which is not typically used for PPI complexes. If the RMSD matrix is provided as a csv in the outpath, AutoGraph will read this matrix and perform clustering based on it. Run AutoGraph on a small subset of your data to see the formatting. Put your desired similarity value (ligand RMSD, interface RMSD, etc) in this format, save it as 'rmsdMatrix.csv' in the outpath, then run AutoGraph. AutoGraph will not include PPI based metrics currently or in the future due to the variablibity in how to read the files, which compromises the integrity of its results. Please know the performance of AutoGraph has only been validated for metabolites.\n \n"
