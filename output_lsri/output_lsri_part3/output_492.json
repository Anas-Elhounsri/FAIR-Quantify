This information is reversed, and becomes COG to KO conversion.\r\n\r\nNew database, making KEGGCharter far more powerful! Makes for a great synergy with reCOGnizer.\r\n\r\nBecause this is webscrapping, `403 - Forbidden` and Timeouts may often occur. \r\n\r\nKEGGCharter gives some time between failed tries, and at the end checks for any KOs whose HTMLs were not retrieved. It tries to retrieve those as well.\r\n\r\n## Sanitization of input file\r\n\r\nChecks if:\r\n* inputted columns exist in the input file\r\n* if `--kegg-column`, `--ko-column`, `--ec-column`, `--cog-column` columns don't have invalid values / bad characters (\" \" and \";\").\r\n\r\n## Added parameter for dividing quantification of each enzyme by the KOs assigned to it\r\n\r\nWhen set, the `--distribute-quantification` parameter will instruct KEGGCharter to split the quantification of each enzyme by all the KOs that were assigned to it. \r\n\r\nThis information is outputted in `data_for_charting.tsv`.\r\n\r\n## New tests for several different parameters' combinations\r\n\r\n`show-available-maps` for `--show-available-maps` parameter.\r\n\r\n`input-quantification-and-taxonomy` for `--input-taxonomy` and `--input-quantification` parameters.\r\n\r\n`include-missing-genomes` for `--include-missing-genomes` parameter.\r\n\r\n`map-all` for `--map-all` parameter.\r\n\r\n## New output folders and writting of JSON information\r\n\r\nKEGGCharter now stores metabolic maps representations in a `maps` folder. No brainer.\r\n\r\nKEGGCharter additionally stores the information concerning the maps into a `json` folder. This folder will contain the dictionaries used for generating both the `potential` and `differential` maps.\r\n\r\n\"Potential\" JSONs come in the form `{box_id: [tax1, tax2, ...]}`.\r\n\r\n\"Differential\" JSONs come in the form `{box_id: [col1, col2, ...]}`.

Only _arcticus_ had KOs with functions for the TCA cycle attributed that, simultaneously, were present in the KGML for the TCA cycle and the taxon _arcticus_.\r\n\r\nThis type of workflow uses both taxon-specific information and results from the datasets inputted. All functions represented validated by KEGG (i.e., those functions are available for those organisms), but many identifications may be lacking, since information at KEGG is often incomplete.\r\n\r\n## Setting \"--include-missing-genomes\" represents organisms that are not in KEGG Genomes\r\n\r\nOrganisms that are not identified in KEGG Genomes can still be represented, if running KEGGCharter with the option `--include-missing-genomes`. All functions for the KOs identified for that organism will be represented (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/iquasere/KEGGCharter/assets/16226371/35b6818b-d0e1-40be-954d-e6630da7dcea\" width=\"600\">\r\n\r\nFig. 2 - KEGGCharter output expanded with `--include-missing-genomes` parameter. _hydrocola_ is not present in KEGG Genomes, but all functions attributed to its KOs are still represented.\r\n\r\nThis setting allows to still obtain validated information for the taxonomies that are present in KEGG Genomes, while also allowing for representation of organisms not present in KEGG Genomes. It should offer the best compromise between false positives and false negatives.\r\n\r\n## Setting \"--map-all\" ignores KEGG Genomes completely, and represents all functions identified\r\n\r\nFunctions that are not present organisms specific KGMLs can still be represented, if running KEGGCharter with the option `--map-all`. This will bypass all taxon specific KGMLs, and map all functions for all KOs present in the input dataset (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/iquasere/KEGGCharter/assets/16226371/96baba0b-e613-4e62-8e31-a8b9358e793e\" width=\"600\">\r\n\r\nFig. 3 - KEGGCharter output expanded with `--map-all` parameter. No functions for _oleophylus_ and _franklandus_ were simultaneously present in the KOs identified and available in their KGMLs. In this case, the requirement for presence in the KGMLs is bypassed, and all functions are represented for all taxa.\r\n\r\nThis setting represents the most information on the KEGG maps, and will produce the most colourful representations, but will likely return many false positives. Maps produced should be analyzed with caution This setting may be required, however, if information for organisms in KEGG Genomes is very incomplete.",

If no such column exists, KEGGCharter must be run with the `-it` parameter.\n* to obtain maps with differential expression, at least one column with genomic and/or transcriptomic quantification must be specified with the `-qcol`parameter. If no such column exists, KEGGCharter must be run with the `-iq` parameter.\n\nAn example input file is available [here](https://github.com/iquasere/KEGGCharter/blob/master/cicd/keggcharter_input.tsv). \nIt contains all fields referenced above, and should be used as guidance for building inputs for KEGGCharter.\nThe following command will obtain metabolic representations for \"Methane Metabolism\" (KEGG map00680) with KEGGCharter:\n```\nkeggcharter -f keggcharter_input.tsv -rd resources_directory -keggc 'KEGG' -koc 'KO' -ecc 'EC number' -cogc 'COG ID' -iq -it \"My community\" -mm 00680 -o first_time_running_KC\n```\nAfter it is over, you should have, inside the `first_time_running_KC` folder:\n* additional information concerning your data in the file `KEGGCharter_results.tsv`\n* maps in PNG format inside a `maps` folder\n* JSONs with the information painted on the maps inside a `json` folder \n\nAdditionally, you should have the `data_for_charting.tsv` and `taxon_to_mmap_to_orthologs` files. These are there so KEGGCharter can be run again, for other maps, by running the same command as before, but with the additional parameter `--resume`. With this parameter, KEGGCharter will look for those files, and new maps can be generated by changing the `--metabolic-maps` parameter. No need for repeated KOs and EC numbers retrieval!\n"
