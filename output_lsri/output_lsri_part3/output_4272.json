If this is not the case, the very first locus will just be excluded from the analyses. \n* Ensure the index in the `Column_order` field matches the time points and replicates order in our sync file.

The alleles following `:` are the remaining observed alleles at that position. Bait-ER handels triallelic and fourallelic sites. \nThe absolute value of the logBFs (fifth columns) can be used to conclude whether a single locus evolves under neutrality or selection, just like the log(p-value) used to build the standard Manhattan plots. An example of the chromosome 2L of hot-adapted D. simulans populations follows (Barghi et al. 2019): the targets of selection are highlighted in red alongside their positions in the chromosome 2L. \nStatistical significance is also assessed via the Bfs; however, the standard BF thresholds a quite relaxed (e.g., log(99)). Since the E&R studies include thousands to millions of loci, we need to be a little bit more stringent about the BFs thresholds to use to select targets of selection. Please read the section *A note on BFs thresholds* for more information on how to correct BFs with Bait-ER properly. \nThe output file may sometimes return rows with NA for columns representing <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\sigma\">, <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\log BF\">, <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\alpha\">, and <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\beta\">:\n```\n2L\t759\tC:A\tNA\tNA\tNA\tNA\n```\nThese loci correspond to flat trajectories that change very little or do not vary at all during the experiment.

Multiple testing is prone to false positives, and we advise the users of Bait-ER to correct their BFs with proper multiple testing correction strategies. In particular, we recommend the strategy proposed by Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007). Their correction requires that we have an idea of the fraction <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F\"> of loci under selection. Then, we set an aimed power of the test <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P\"> and the odds <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O\"> in favor of a true positive to a false positive. These three quantities can be translated into a BF that serves as a threshold for picking targets of selection: \nIf we consider that an E&R experiment should have 0.1% expected loci under selection and set an aimed power of 0.5 and odds favoring true positives over false positives of 10, we calculate a corrected BF of 9.9. This threshold is considerably more restrictive than the typical thresholds used in standard Bayesian applications, where BFs higher than 3.4 represent already very strong evidence in favor of the tested hypothesis. \n \n"

Bait-ER uses `armadillo`, which requires the `LAPACK`, `boost` and `BLAS` packages. The following commands install these packages (same applies to Mac OS X, but using `brew` instead of `sudo apt-get`):\n\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install liblapack-dev\nsudo apt-get install libblas-dev\nsudo apt-get install libboost-dev\nsudo apt-get install libarmadillo-dev\n```\n\nBait-ER is coded in C++ and needs to be compiled; this step will produce an executable. We use the `g++` compiler, but any other can be used:\n\n```\ng++ baiter.cpp -o baiter -O2 -std=c++14 -llapack -lblas -larmadillo\n```\n\nYou should have created an executable called `baiter` in your working directory. If you experience errors during the compilation step (e.g., libraries missing), please read the section **Compilation errors and how to solve them**. Before running Bait-ER, let us first explain its input files: the sync and control files.\n\n"

The gamma distribution is defined over the fitness domain: i.e., 1 + <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\sigma\">, so be carefull to substract 1 whenever you want to report a statistic for <img src=\"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\\sigma\">.  \nTo calculate additional statistics one can use the `qgamma` function in `R`.
