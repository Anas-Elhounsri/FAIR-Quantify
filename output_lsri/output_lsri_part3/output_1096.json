For example, keeping only samples of EUR population if the input xQTL statistics are derived from subjects of European ancestry, or/and filtering rare and non-biallelic variants since most of the current xQTL studies still focus on common variants due to limited sample size.

        "value": "xQTLImp is an open source software that implements imputation of xQTL(such as eQTL, mQTL, haQTL et. al) statistics across the genome. xQTLImp accepts xQTL summary statistics (i.e., Z statistics) without the need of individual-level genotypes and molecular traits (such as gene expression profiles), and could accurately impute novel xQTL associations from known associations based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) among variants. Specifically, it models the statistics of variants associated with the same molecular trait by using a multivariate Gaussian model, and infers missing association statistics from nearby known association statistics by leveraging LD among variants (See Methods in the paper). Using multiple real datasets, we demonstrated that 1) xQTLImp can impute missing xQTL statistics with high accuracy, and 2) xQTLImp can effiectively reduce the lower bound of MAF in xQTL studies, leading to the discovery of novel xQTL signals to further enhance xQTL discoveries.\n\nxQTLImp requires as compulsory input data: (1) genotype reference panel (such as 1000G or HapMap) for calculating LD correlations; (2) xQTL summary statistics (Z statistics) measured from associations between genotypes and molecular traits, where variants are identified by genomic coordinates and ref/alt alleles; (3) molecular trait annotation. The output is a list of variant-molecular trait associations, with a imputation flag (1 for novel) and imputation quality score, r2pred from (0,1). \n\nxQTLImp could handle various kinds of molecular traits (not limited to gene expression, DNA methylation or histone acetylation) that can be physically mapped onto the genome. Genomic variants including SNV and small Indel (Insertion/deletion) are both supported. xQTLImp allows users to specify chromosome and MAF of variants, discard certain regions (such as HLA region) and run in multiple threads. Regarding the performance, xQTLImp was designed in speed and memory efficient way, and it took 3~4 hours and <4GB memory for the genome-wide imputation on a single-cell eQTL datasets using 20 threads (see Suppl. Notes in the paper), which could be easily distributed on PC and server.\n\nThe source code and sample data are freely available for download at current webpage. The software is released under GNU GPL license (version 3). xQTLImp is implemented in C++ and has been successfully tesed in Linux and Mac OS X platforms.\n</br>\n"

        "value": "The parameters can be specified by short options (e.g. -h) or long options (e.g. --help), which have same effects. Please see the parameters and explanations as follows:\n```bash\nxQTLImp\n-h, --help           null           # null, to display this usage.\n-x, --xQTL           file_path      # string, the file path of xQTL summary statistics.\n-m, --molecule       file_path      # string, the file path of molecule annotation file.\n-v, --VCF            folder_path    # string, the folder path of genome reference panel, such as 1000G VCF files.\n-o, --output         folder_path    # string, the folder path of output results. \n-c, --chr            chromosome     # int, specify which chromosome will be imputed.\n-t, --num_threads    num_threads    # int, number of threads, 1 in default.\n-s, --sort           TRUE/FALSE     # boolean, sort the xQTL summary statistics by chromosome, molecular_ID, and variant_pos in increasing order prior imputation (required), FALSE in default.\n-e, --exclude        chr:start-end  # int:int-int, specify a genome region in which variants will be ignored during imputation process.\n-b, --exclude_file   file_path      # string, multiple genome regions user want to mask during imputation process.\n-f, --MAF_cutoff     MAF_cutoff     # double, minimum MAF threshold for variants in genome reference panel, 0.01 in default.\n-l, --lambda_value   lambda_value   # double, a constant value used to added with var-covariance matrix to gurantee the matrix is invertible, 0.1 in default. \n-w, --window_size    window_size    # int, Window size N, +-N/2 apart from molecular center pos, in base pair, 500000bp in default.\n```\n*Notes:* \n* ```-e or --exclude``` is useful for users to exclude genome regions they want to ignore, such as the complex human HLA region (6:25000000-35000000 in hg19), which will tremendously slow down the imputation process because of high density of genomic markers. \n* Combining ```-c or --chr``` with ```-t or --num_threads``` could greatly save time for users by taking advantage of HPC. For example, on a slurm based cluster, the following script named *Cluster_sample.sh* can be submitted onto multiple nodes with multiple threads:\n\n```bash\ncat Cluster_sample.sh  # in shell\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH -c 16                   # Number of cores\n#SBATCH -t 2:00:00              # Runtime\n#SBATCH -p short                # Partition (queue) to submit to\n#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G        # memory needed (memory PER CORE)\nchr=$1\nPath_to_xQTLImp/src/xQTLImp             \\\n-x your_path/Input_xQTL_file            \\\n-m your_path/molecular_annotation_file  \\\n-v your_path/1000G_ref_panel/           \\\n-o your_output_folder_path/             \\\n-e 6:25000000-35000000                  \\\n-c $chr                                 \\\n-t 16\n\n# shell code\nfor chr in {1..22}}; do\n\tsbatch Cluster_sample.sh $chr\ndone\n```\n"
