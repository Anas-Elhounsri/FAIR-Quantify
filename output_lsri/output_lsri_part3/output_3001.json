The metadata are compiled from more than 7000 isolates. \nThe subtree presented is the lowest branch of the main tree that contains all of the isolates that return blast hits to the queried sequence. \nPairwise identities to each sequence are shown on the tips, and the tips are coloured with respect to identity. The best hit is highlighted by a large diamond tip. Predicted subgenus classifications of all tips are shown. \nTo the right, a presence/absence summary of the metadata associated with each tip is displayed. The idea of this is that it is possible to rapidly assess the associations made by sequences that are similar to the one you are querying. \n"
