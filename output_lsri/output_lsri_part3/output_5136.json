This opens a table with all species present in the samples. To sort the rows (species) by one column one has to click on the header, e.g. click in Phylum to sort by phylum name. To hide all species belonging to the phylum *Streptophyta* one has to right-click in the column Phylum in a row where hide is False. Then a popup menu will appear where one has to click on **hide/show**. If in the row hide is False all *Streptohyta* will be displayed, if one right clicks on Streptophyta and in the popup menu chooses **hide/show**.\n\n> **Note for Linux users:** right-clicking to open a popup menu will only show the menu as long as one clicks.\n\nTo compare two groups of samples choose **Compare two groups of samples** in the **Overview**-menu.\n\nSelect the samples belonging to the first group in the left listbox, e.g. all samples from 2012 and change the name of the group from 'group1' to '2012'. Do the same for the second group of samples.\nTo run the differential abundance analysis one has to click on **ANCOM**. Then a file dialog will open in case one wants to save the results as a .csv file. The results are also displayed in MicroWineBar. Here one can click on the rows to get a popup whith the following options: **show information** to get a Wikipedia summary and **abundances in two groups** to get two bar graphs.\nTo get a PCA plot one has to click on **PCA**.\nTo obtain boxplots of the species richness and Shannon diversity one has to click on **richness** and **Shannon diversity** respectively. There is also the option to get these plots for all samples instead of the two groups. For this one has to click in the **Diversity indices**-menu on **richness** or **Shannon diversity** respectively.\n"
