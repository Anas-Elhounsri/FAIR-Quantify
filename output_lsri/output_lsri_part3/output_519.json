Install Docker. To this aim, check out the correct [installation procedure](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your platform.\n\n2. Install Docker-compose. As in the first step, check out the correct [installation procedure](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to get [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed for your platform.\n\n3. Check the Docker daemon (`dockerd`)  is up and running.\n\n4. Download or clone the [medtag-core](https://github.com/MedTAG/medtag-core) repository.\n\n5. Open MedTAG_Dockerized/baseurl.txt file and put the baseURL of the server where MedTAG is deployed. If the server hosting MedTAG has the baseURL http://example.com/server/example/, specify this URL in place of the http://0.0.0.0:8000/ provided by default.\n\n6. Open the [MedTAG_Dockerized](https://github.com/MedTAG/medtag-core/tree/main/MedTAG_Dockerized) project folder and, on a new terminal session, type ```docker-compose up```. After running the latter command the installation of MedTAG dependencies is performed and the following output will be generated:\n\n   ![installation_process_output](./img/screenshots/installation_process_output.png)\n\n   **NOTE**: In Unix-like systems `docker-compose` should be run  without using `sudo` in a directory owned by the user.\n\n7. MedTAG installation has completed and you can access it on your browser at http://0.0.0.0:8000/.\n\n**NOTE**: If you want to shut down MedTAG, open a new terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Finally type `docker-compose down`\n\n**NOTE**: If you want to redo the whole installation process and run MedTAG in *Test Mode* (i.e., with the provided sample data) open a new terminal and, inside the project folder, run the following commands: \n\n   1. `docker-compose down`\n   2. `sudo rm -rf data`\n   3. `docker image ls`\n   4. Then select the IMAGE ID of the image whose name is *medtag dockerized web* and run: `docker image rm <IMAGE ID>`\n   5. Finally run `docker-compose up`\n \n **NOTE**: If you are running docker in operating systems like CentOS and the installation can not terminate due to errors related to Cython, you can install MedTAG with a different `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files based on Ubuntu:20.04 OS. These files can be found at: `medtag-core/docker_config_ubuntuOS/`. Copy the `Dockerfile` and the `docker-compose.yml` files in: `medtag-core/MedTAG_Dockerized` and make sure these files overwrite the existing ones. Stop the container, remove the images related to the previous installation process that threw the errors and redo the entire installation.\n"

It is worth noting that only the admin user has the privileges to change the MedTAG configurations. Moreover, **every time a new configuration is provided the previous one will be overwritten, thus data and annotations will be removed as well**.   \n\nTo start a new configuration follow the instructions below:\n\n1. Open the Menu from the _Test Mode_ and go to _Configure_.\n\n   ![menu_main_interface](./img/screenshots/config_1_580.png)\n\n   ![configure](./img/screenshots/config_580.png)\n\n2. Read and follow the instructions of the guided procedure.\n\n   ![](./img/screenshots/update_data_conf_445x500.png)\n\n3. Provide the CSV files.\n\n   **NOTE**: You can add one or more files from the same folder. If it is the first time you configure MedTAG, you are asked to provide both the username and the password that will be used by the admin user to login into MedTAG. The admin user is the only one who can change the configuration files and access the data. If you do not have access to _Configure_ section (i.e., you do not see it in the side bar), this means that you are not logged in as the admin user.\n\n   **NOTE**: It is mandatory to upload at least one file between ***reports_file*** and ***pubmed_file***. Once you uploaded one or more **reports_file**, MedTAG automatically detects the columns which characterize your report and asks you to choose which fields of the report you want to hide, display or annotate. **You need to set at least one field to be displayed**.  If you uploaded one or more **pubmed_file** instead, you do not have to to set any field to be displayed or annotated: *abstract* and *title* are annotable by default, while *volume*, *journal*, *year*, *authors* are only displayed.\n\n   **NOTE**: The *concepts_file* and _labels_file_ and are not mandatory. This means that if you are not interested in labels annotation and/or concepts identification you can avoid to provide them. By the way,  you must provide either the _labels_file_ or the *concepts_file* or set at least one field to *Display* and *Annotate*.\n\n   ![reportsfields](./img/screenshots/reportsfields_857x500.png)\n   \n    **NOTE**: If you uploaded the ***reports_file*** or the ***pubmed_file*** giving *Colon, Uterine cervix* or *Lung* as use-cases, you can rely on a set of concepts and labels we provide, without uploading your own ones. Remember that it is not allowed to upload new concepts (or labels) if you decided to rely on those we provide. \n\n4. Check the format of the provided CSV files, by clicking on the *Check* button. Then, the automatic procedure will produce some state messages in different colors:\n\n     - Green: messages in green color (i.e., success messages)  mean that the provided CSV files are well-formatted.\n\n     - Orange: messages in orange color (i.e., warning messages) mean that you **should revise the format of the provided CSV files**. Nevertheless, the provided CSV files are accepted anyway.\n\n     - Red: messages in red color (i.e., error messages) mean that you **must revise the format of the provided CSV files**, since they are not well-formatted. Error messages provide information about the errors occurred and suggest the user how to fix the issues.\n\n       ![examplemessages](./img/screenshots/examplemessages_771x500.png)\n\n5. When the procedure has ended, a notification of success or error will be provided. If you provided reports (or PubMed articles) whose use-cases are: *Colon, Uterine cervix* or *lung* you will be notified that automatic annotation is available. This operation can be time consuming, hence you can decide to automatically annotate your reports or log in and start the automatic annotation process in another moment. If you want to automatically annotate your reports you have to select the fields you want to extract the concepts, the mentions and the labels from. In case of successful configuration of MedTAG, the login page will look like the screenshot below. \n\n   ![loginnew](./img/screenshots/loginnew_296x344.png)\n"

You can add some reports, labels or concepts. You can also change the fields to display and annotate. If you want to update the fields to annotate and display, remember that you cannot set to *Hide* or *Display* the fields you previously decided to annotate, since this would affect the annotations that rely on those fields.\n\n   **NOTE**: If you decide to add reports having columns that MedTAG has never detected before, you will be asked to choose what columns to display, hide or annotate.\n \n3. In this page you can also automatically annotate your reports whose use-cases are: *Colon, Uterine cervix* or *Lung* (if any). You can decide for each use-case what fields you want to extract concepts, labels and mentions from. This process might be time and memory consuming, this is why we recommend you to have machines powerful enough (see **requirements** section) to perform this task. \n\n   **NOTE**: If you want to automatically re-annotate reports belonging to a use-case, all the ground-truths previously automatically created for that use-case will be removed. The same holds for the automatic annotation of PubMed articles.\n\n   ![update](./img/screenshots/update_conf_676x344.PNG)\n   \n   # MedTAG Benchmark \n\nMedTAG annotation performance has been assessed by means of an automatic agent, which simulated the annotation process for two specific use-cases: \n\n1. **document-level annotation**: this task concerns the annotation of documents with labels that describe the overall document content.\n2. **mention-level annotation**: this task concerns the identification of concept-related mentions, in the documents' textual content.\n\nThe annotation process performance has been evaluated in terms of:\n\n1. **number of actions**: number of user-required actions (e.g. clicks and keys pressed) to annotate documents according to the use-cases specified.\n2. **time elapsed**: the amount of time required to perform the whole annotation process (i.e. all the sample documents considered get annotated).\n\nThe analysis we conducted considers a sample of one hundred documents, randomly chosen from a real dataset concerning the digital pathology domain (i.e. colon cancer clinical reports). We assessed the performances of MedTAG and other annotation tools including [ezTag](https://eztag.bioqrator.org/), [MyMiner](https://myminer.armi.monash.edu.au/) and [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/). We measured the number of actions and the time elapsed for each annotation tool. We computed the mean and the standard deviation over forty trials.\n\nThe experiment results are summarized in the following tables:\n\n**Table 1**: **document-level annotation** performance analysis\n\n|                                            Tool | #Actions | Elapsed time in seconds (mean) | Standard deviation in seconds |\n| ----------------------------------------------: | :------: | :----------------------------: | :---------------------------: |\n| [MedTAG](https://github.com/MedTAG/medtag-core) |   200    |             46.84              |             0.803             |\n|  [MyMiner](https://myminer.armi.monash.edu.au/) |   100    |             56.677             |             0.416             |\n|               [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/) |   400    |             205.74             |             5.471             |\n\n\n\n**Table 2**: **mention-level annotation** performance analysis\n\n|                                            Tool | #Actions | Elapsed time in seconds (mean) | Standard deviation in seconds |\n| ----------------------------------------------: | :------: | :----------------------------: | :---------------------------: |\n| [MedTAG](https://github.com/MedTAG/medtag-core) |   519    |            159.337             |             0.479             |\n|           [ezTag](https://eztag.bioqrator.org/) |   307    |             260.34             |             0.576             |\n|             [teamTat](https://www.teamtat.org/) |   307    |            271.577             |             1.542             |\n|               [tagtog](https://www.tagtog.net/) |   404    |            304.692             |            10.067             |\n|  [MyMiner](https://myminer.armi.monash.edu.au/) |   414    |            114.390             |             1.507             |\n\n"
