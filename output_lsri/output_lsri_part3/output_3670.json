Great advances have been made in terms of feasibility, cost, throughput, and read-length. However, sample contamination still poses a big issue: it complicates correct, high-quality downstream analysis of sequencing data and usage in medical applications. Furthermore, it might be unclear weather the sequenced reads represent the intended target. To address these issues we developed a cross-platform desktop application: Sequ-Into. Reads originating from unwanted sources are detected and summarized by a comprehensive statistical overview, but can also be filtered and exported in standardized FASTQ-format to facilitate custom evaluation of experimental findings. This holds also true for an evaluation weather the reads consist of the intended source, and allows for a positive selection of those reads who do. Sequ-Into creates a straightforward user experience by fusing an intuitive graphical-user-interface with state-of-the-art long-read alignment software.\r\n\r\nThe app was implemented in the context of our iGEM project, where several DNA purification protocols were evaluated with Sequ-Into and thus allowed iterative engineering cycles leading to a so far unreached purification of up to 96% (bases sequenced) in our probes.

        "description": "This release contains minor changes:\r\n\r\n* adds a general aligned/unaligned pie chart\r\n* adds Docker support:\r\n\r\nTo build your container clone the repository and run `docker build -t sequ-into .` .\r\nAfter this has successfully finished, you can run sequ-into via Docker `docker run -v D:/data:/mnt/d -it -e DISPLAY=$XSERVER sequ-into` . You need to mount the folders you want to access with the `-v`option, and should also provide a `$XSERVER` location, e.g. `192.168.2.101:0.0` such that the GUI can be shown.\r\n\r\nLinux and Mac OS users may use the docker build, a Windows executable of this release is attached.\r\n\r\n####  Demo data extension\r\nThe demo data have been extended with demo use-cases 6 and 7. In use-case 6 simulated reads are used to assess the accuracy of the mapping capabilities of the methods employed by sequ-into, while use-case 7 (ERR3078229-ERR3078231) is a meta-genomics benchmark to assess how well sequ-into assigns reads to a specific organism.",
