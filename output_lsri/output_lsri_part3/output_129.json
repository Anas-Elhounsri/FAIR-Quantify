About HUBdesign\n\nHierarchical Unique Baits (\u201cHUB\u201d)Design or HUBdesign provides a pipeline, models, and algorithms that allow for the simultaneous and specific capture of known and novel targets through the design of probes for DNA capture. \n\nThe HUBdesign tool provides a process that can help develop probes used to capture pathogens within various samples including animals, humans, environmental, and others. HUBdesign utilizes sequence homology to identify probes and sets of probes that increase overall coverage for targets while maintaining specificity.\n\nThis algorithm may be downloaded and used for sample analysis from https://github.com/zacherydickson/HUBDesign/ (\u201cHUBdesign website\u201d). The algorithm uses a set of annotated genomes and a species tree to create a probe set which will allow the unique capture of as many nodes in the tree as possible, attempting to balance the number of baits per genome.\n\nHUBdesign was created by Zachery Dickson, graduate student in the Department of Biology at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) under the supervision of Hendrik Poinar, Professor of Anthropology at McMaster University, molecular evolutionary geneticist, and biological anthropologist by training.\n\nHUBdesign is built on open source software and tools using Perl and C++. This research has been supported by funds from the CIHR COVID grant, the Boris Family Fund, the Michael G.DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research, and the CIFAR Humans and the Microbiome Program.  \n\nSequencing data generated is available on the Sequence Read Archive under the Bio Project accession PRJNA674643. Generated Probe Sequences and associated metadata can be found at https://github.com/zacherydickson/HUBDesign/tree/main/probes \n\n\n2.

        "description": "# IMPORTANT: Update to the license for this and all subsequent releases of HUBDesign - The code is no longer freely available for commercial use\r\n\r\n## Changes in version 1.4.1\r\n- Alterations to the construction of the guide dendrogram during the assignment phase resulting in faster construction and improved guide trees\r\n- Changes to the rooting of the guide dendrogram, which now by default selects the most isolated taxa as outgroups; this outgrouping can be optionally disabled. If the isolated outgrouping is disabled the root will be placed at the bipartition in the tree which has the most support\r\n- Fixed a bug where specifying specific melting temperatures for the Identification phase resulted in an invalid command to SA_BOND\r\n- Updated SA_BOND readme to include mention of blacklist parameter\r\n- Increased speed of Identification phase when blacklisting low penetrance sequences\r\n- Fixed Bug in Identification step where SA_BOND would ignore the specified maximum number of threads\r\n- Update to Clustering step where a column of CIGAR strings are added in the cluster information output. This is useful for determining divergence of probes from their nominal targets.\r\n\r\n## Changes from unreleased version 1.3.1\r\n\r\n- Added a new default behaviour during the Identification phase, where sequences failing the penetrance threshold are gathered together into a set of blacklisted sequences to prevent selection of probes targeting these sequences\r\n- Improved logging of Pseudo Genomes present at steps of the Identification phase\r\n- Miniscule performance boost to collapsing candidate probes during the Identification phase",
