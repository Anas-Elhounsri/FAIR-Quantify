        "value": "Sleep cycles are largely detected according to the originally proposed\ncriteria by Feinberg & Floyd (1979) and as described in Blume & Cajochen\n(2021) . NREM periods are periods starting with N1 (default) or N2 at\nthe beginning of the night and W or another NREM stage following a REM\nperiod. NREMPs have a minimal duration minimal duration of 15min (can\ninclude W, up to &lt;5min REM, except for the first REMP, for which\nthere is no minimum duration criterion). REM following a NREM period\nalways represents a potential REM period, however any REMP must be at\nleast 5min long (except the first REMP, for which no minimum duration\ncriterion is applied). If a NREMP exceeds 120min in duration (excl.\nwake), it can be split into 2 parts. The new cycle starts with the first\nN3 episode following a phase (&gt;12min) with any other stage than N3,\nthat is a lightening of sleep (cf.\u00a0Rudzik et al., 2020; Jenni et al.,\n2004; Kurth et al., 2010). The function makes suggestions where\nsplitting could be done according to these criteria and visualises the\npotential splitting points on top of a hypnogram. The user can then\ninteractively choose where to split the NREMP. However, the code also\noffers the possibility to provide a numeric value for an epoch at which\nto split or you can also decide to not split at all. A combination of a\nNREMP and the following REMP represents one sleep cycle, except for the\ncase when a NREMP is split. In this case, the first of the two resulting\nNREMPs represents a sleep cycle (without REM).\n \n"
