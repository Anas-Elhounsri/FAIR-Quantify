Most often, DNA typing exploits the high variability of short tandem repeat (STR) sequences to differentiate between individuals at the genetic level. Comparison of STR profiles can be used for human identification in a wide range of forensic cases including homicides, sexual assaults, missing persons, and mass disaster victims. The number of contiguous repeat units present at a given microsatellite locus varies significantly among individuals and thus makes them useful for human identification purposes. Here, we are presents a complete pipeline i.e. STRspy to identify STRs in a long read sample i.e. Oxford nanopore sequencing reads and Pacbio reads.\n"
