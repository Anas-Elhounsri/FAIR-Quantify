Here we provide code for general usage and to reproduce the results in our paper `VoPo Leverages Cellular Heterogeneity for Predictive Modeling of Single-Cell Data`. **You can focus on tasks 1-4 for instructons on general usage: clustering, feature extraction, and visualization (e.g. coloring cells by differentiation score)**. Tasks 1-4 outlined in this readme enable the following: \n1) **Metaclustering and Feature Engineering [Task 1]**: Run VoPo clustering on some FCS files and extract features (either frequency or functional) \n2) **Using Engineered Features for Classification [Task 2]**: After extracting VoPo features, we show you how to apply feature selection and run the classification task \n3) **Differentiation Score Visualization + Coloring by Phenotypic Marker Expression [Task 3]**: Generate comprehensive single-cell visualizations of frequency differences. We will show a generic example for general usage and examples for each of the 3 datasets in the paper (Figure 2A-C).   \n4) **More Flexible: Visualize Cells According to a Differentiation Score Reflecting Functional Differences [Task 4]**: Examples on how to create single-cell visualizations with points colored by differentiation score (Fig 2 a-c) for frequency features and for functional features. We also have an option for 'directional differences' (e.g. to visualization which class a particular cell-type is higher in)\n \n"

Use function, \n\n```R\nsource('VoPo_main/SampleCells.R') \n```\n\n* Step 2: Color the sampled cells by phenotypic marker expression\n\n```R\nsource('VoPo_main/vizAtlas_Phenotype.R')\n```\n* Step 3: Make a frequency map. Each cell will be colored by differentiation score according to frequency. Use the function,\n\n```R\nsource('VoPo_main/vizAtlas_Freq.R')\n```\n\n* Step 4: Make functional maps. For each functional marker in your panel, each cell will be colored according to differentiation score based on the expression of that particular functional marker. Note that as one of the functional arguments you will specify the directory to write these plots to. They will all go to one place. Use the function,\n\n```R\nsource('VoPo_main/vizAtlas_Function.R')\n```\n\nWe also have functions for making directrional plots, which will indicate which class has higher frequency or function. By default, it will use the minimum value of the response vector (e.g. sample classifications) to be colored blue and the maximum value of the response vector (e.g. sample classifications) to be colored blue. So, if a point is colored red, it means it likely belongs to a cell-population where the functional marker expression/frequency was likely increased.\n\nTo make a frequency single-cell map with colors indicating direction:\n\n```R\nsource('VoPo_main/vizAtlas_Freq_Directional.R')\n```\n\nTo make a frequency single-cell map with colors indicating direction:\n\n```R\nsource('VoPo_main/vizAtlas_Function_Directional.R')\n```\n\nThis completes instructions for tasks 1-4 for general usage purposes.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe also have examples (Tasks 5-6) for reproducting results in our paper.\n\n5) **Task 5: Classification in all 3 datasets (Fig 2D)**: Feature Use VoPo features for classification tasks in each of the 3 datasets. Also reproduce the results in Figure 2D. Generating distributions of classification accuracies from single vs. repeated metaclustering solutions (Figure 2D.). \n\nAlternatively, in (6) we have provided an example for re-running all clustering results from scratch. However this will require downloading FCS files from flow repository and modifying the paths in the scripts to the data, accordingly.  \n\n6) **Task 6: Re-run repeated metaclustering from scratch on the 3 datasets**: Re-running the repeated metaclustering strategy from scratch along with classification and visualization. Note that this task requires downloading FCS files from each dataset. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
