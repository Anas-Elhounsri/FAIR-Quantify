The subfolder \"./publication_runs/ecoli_models\" contains all analysis scripts and used run result text reports (in the local subfolder \"run_results\") for ecolicore2double, ecolicore2triple and iML1515double,\nincluding all 24 scenarios with a maximal MILP run time of 1000 s as well as the exemplary two runs with a maximal MILP run time of 10000 s. \nA report of the exact given 3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (kdo8p) synthesis example in ASTHERISC's publication can be directly created with the \"kdo8p_example.m\" script, in which only the reactions used in the shown example are allowed. The reason for this separated script is that, depending on the CPLEX version and computational capability of the used computer or cluster, other alternative results for the kdo8p synthesis may arise, although all of them are equally valid since they reach the same optimal MDF. In other words, the kdo8p synthesis example given in ATHERISC's publication may arise as well as other possibilities to enhance the OptMDF in the given range. \n"

        "value": "The ASTHERISC package was developed for stoichiometric single-species community models which were generated by [CommModelPy](https://www.github.com/ARB-Lab/CommModelPy). The ASTHERISC package and CommModelPy were written by the same author and were firstly described in the same publication [(Bekiaris & Klamt, 2021)](#astheriscs-publication).\n\nThe ASTHERISC package's primary script file is \"astherisc.m\" which can be found in this repository's main folder. The usage of \"astherisc.m\", such as all neccessary arguments, is described in more detail in its source code header comment.\n\nIn addition, the other important script for the general user is \"loadAndSaveCommModelPyCommunityModel.m\". It reads a) a [CommModelPy](https://www.github.com/ARB-Lab/CommModelPy)-generated community model in the SBML format and b) a JSON containing the dG0 data for the model's reactions and stores it as a combined .mat file which is the necessary model with dG0 data format for \"astherisc.m\". This script's usage is also explained in more detail in its source code header comment.\n\nThe JSON containing the dG0 values generally has to be structured as follows in the case of a two-strain community (in a models with a higher number strains, you have to add the specific reaction ids in the other species):\n<pre>\n{\n    \"$REACTION_1_ID_IN_SPECIES_1\": {\n        \"dG0\": $dG0_VALUE_REACTION_1,\n        \"uncertainty\": $UNCERTAINTY_VALUE_REACTION_1\n    },\n    \"$REACTION_1_ID_IN_SPECIES_2\": {\n        \"dG0\": $dG0_VALUE_REACTION_1,\n        \"uncertainty\": $UNCERTAINTY_VALUE_REACTION_1\n    },\n    \"$REACTION_2_ID_IN_SPECIES_1\": {\n        \"dG0\": $dG0_VALUE_REACTION_1,\n        \"uncertainty\": $UNCERTAINTY_VALUE_REACTION_1\n    },\n    (...)\n}\n</pre>\n\nFor example, if the CommModelPy-generated model has two reactions called A (with a dG0 of -5 and an uncertainty of 1) and B (with a dG0 of 10 and an uncertainty of 2), three strains with the labels \"species1\", \"species2\" and \"species3\", the JSON would look like this:\n<pre>\n{\n    \"A_species1\": {\n        \"dG0\": -5,\n        \"uncertainty\": 1\n    },\n    \"A_species2\": {\n        \"dG0\": -5,\n        \"uncertainty\": 1\n    },\n    \"A_species3\": {\n        \"dG0\": -5,\n        \"uncertainty\": 1\n    },\n    \"B_species1\": {\n        \"dG0\": 10,\n        \"uncertainty\": 2\n    },\n    \"B_species2\": {\n        \"dG0\": 10,\n        \"uncertainty\": 2\n    },\n    \"B_species3\": {\n        \"dG0\": 10,\n        \"uncertainty\": 2\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n"
