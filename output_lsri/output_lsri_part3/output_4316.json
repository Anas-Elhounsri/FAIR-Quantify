ARTDeco can also correct gene expression values by using read-in levels to deconvolute native gene expression and contribution from upstream readthrough transcription. ARTDeco works on both single-end and paired-end data, stranded and unstranded data, and forward and reverse strand oriented data (more information on this [below](#assorted-usage-notes)). \n"

The home directory (-home-dir) is the directory in which the ARTDeco results file structure will reside (structure outlined [here](#interpreting-artdeco-outputs)) and the BAM files directory (-bam-files-dir) is where your BAM files reside. The defaults for these are the present directory so it may be convenient to create a directory, place the BAM files there, and run ARTDeco without those flags specified. The GTF file (-gtf-file) is a gene annotation and the chromosome sizes file contains the sizes of the chromosomes of the reference genome. The format of these is discussed [here](#preparing-files). Similarly, the meta and comparisons files (-meta-file and -comparisons-file) contain information for the experimental design for DESeq2. Their details are [here](#preparing-files).

At a bare minimum, you need a GTF file for your genome of interest as well as a chromosome sizes file. \n\nARTDeco converts these GTF files to BED files for manipulation as well as detection of BAM file information (covered in more depth below) using a utility from BEDOPS (gtf2bed). gtf2bed is formatted for GTFs with UCSC standard format and is temperamental with GENCODE files. Run the following command to check if your GTF file works:\n``` \ngtf2bed < genes.gtf\n```\nIf the output is the following, then you have an issue:\n``` \nError: Potentially missing gene or transcript ID from GTF attributes (malformed GTF at line [1]?)\n```\nThe solution to this is actually simple:\n``` \nawk '{ if ($0 ~ \"transcript_id\") print $0; else print $0\" transcript_id \\\"\\\";\"; }' genes.gtf > modified_genes.gtf\n```\nHopefully, BEDOPS will correct this bug or I will write my own parser if possible.\n\nAdditionally, ARTDeco requires a chromosome sizes file. This is easily generated using samtools with the following few lines of code:\n``` \nsamtools faidx genome.fa\ncut -f1,2 genome.fa.fai > genome.chrom.sizes\n```\n\nThere are two other files that need to be generated if the user wants to utilize differential expression in the analyses (covered below). These are the meta file and the comparisons file. The meta file puts labels to each experiment for DESeq2 and the comparisons file tells the differential expression script which comparisons to outcome. These files are tab-delimited and examples are given in the SampleInputs folder in the repository.\n\nThe comparisons file is not strictly necessary and ARTDeco will generate one. However, this is not recommended as ARTDeco will do an all-by-all comparisons and this can be time consuming with larger datasets.\n\nARTDeco will automatically reformat these files when running any differential expression so that they play well with DESeq2. \n\nThe only remaining requirement in terms of files is that you place all of your BAM files in a directory. ARTDeco will generate a directory structure (discussed in the [Interpreting ARTDeco Outputs](#interpreting-artdeco-outputs) section) around these files."

        "value": "ARTDeco is a Python package that requires Python 3.6 or higher. Additionally, the following packages are required:\n```\nbedops>=2.4.35\nbx-python>=0.8.2\nDESeq2>=1.20\nHomer>=4.9\nnetworkx>=2.2\nnumpy>=1.16.2\npandas>=0.24.2\nrpy2>=2.9.4\nRSeQC>=3.0.0\nsamtools=1.9\nsetuptools\n```\nThe easiest way to install these is to use either Anaconda or Miniconda as a package manager using the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel and the following command:\n```\nconda install bedops=2.4.* bioconductor-deseq2=1.20.* bx-python=0.8.* homer=4.9.* networkx=2.* numpy=1.16.* pandas=0.24.* pybigwig rpy2=2.9.* rseqc=3.0.* samtools=1.9\n```\nThis is recommended because the dependency management of conda is very good. With this in mind, I've created a simple conda environment for running ARTDeco (located in the Conda folder) if you don't feel like adding these packages to your current environment. Go into the Conda directory and run the following code:\n```\nconda env create -f environment.yml\n```\nThis creates an environment called ARTDeco.\n\nA conda recipe for ARTDeco is in development and should be out fairly soon with Bioconda. It is important to note that Bioconda's version of Homer is a bit buggy so you will not get the full functionality of Homer (which is not necessary here)."

The [next section](#interpreting-artdeco-outputs) will explain the structure of the outputs and how to them. The ARTDeco help screen can be viewed using the following command:\n``` \nARTDeco -h\n```\nBecause ARTDeco uses a standard output structure, this allows it to compute the existence of various file dependencies in order to both reduce redundancy and run time. There is an option (-overwrite) which tells the program to regenerate all files. However, this may be computationally onerous as you may want to alter only one or a few sections. For this reason, ARTDeco has several modes (outlined below) that allow you to specify which outputs are generated. Best practice is to run ARTDeco all the way through while specifying as many parameters as possible, examine outputs, and then regenerate specified files with new thresholds where appropriate. Some of the philosophy behind this is specified in the [Assorted Usage Notes Section](#assorted-usage-notes).\n\nThe final note on running ARTDeco is that all of the BAM files should be from the same experimental set. Not only does this make sense in terms of good experimental practice, ARTDeco is built to generate files differently for differently formatted BAM files. The users can specify these formats in the command line or ARTDeco can infer the file format of the BAM (i.e., paired-end vs. single-end, stranded-specific vs. unstranded, and forward vs. reverse strand orientation). These formats are necessary when generating many of the files (e.g., strandedness is important for counting reads for various regions). When in doubt, specify your own formats using the -layout (PE or SE), -stranded (True or False), and -orientation (Forward or Reverse)."

The home directory (-home-dir) is the directory in which the ARTDeco results file structure will reside (structure outlined [here](#interpreting-artdeco-outputs)) and the BAM files directory (-bam-files-dir) is where your BAM files reside. The defaults for these are the present directory so it may be convenient to create a directory, place the BAM files there, and run ARTDeco without those flags specified. The GTF file (-gtf-file) is a gene annotation and the chromosome sizes file contains the sizes of the chromosomes of the reference genome. The format of these is discussed [here](#preparing-files). Similarly, the meta and comparisons files (-meta-file and -comparisons-file) contain information for the experimental design for DESeq2. Their details are [here](#preparing-files). How to interpret ARTDeco outputs is covered below in [Interpreting ARTDeco Outputs](#interpreting-artdeco-outputs) section for information on how to understand these outputs."

        "value": "ARTDeco has a rigidly-defined file structure that is internally-maintained as a dependency graph. For this reason, it is good practice to name input files differently from files generated by ARTDeco and maintain those files outside of ARTDeco's directory structure. For example, if you have a meta file, you shouldn't name it meta.reformatted.txt and place it inside the preprocess_files directory. This represents bad programming practice in general and will break ARTDeco in particular.\n\nARTDeco can theoretically take any genomic data that reflects the transcriptional state. This includes polyA-RNAseq, total RNAseq, RNA PolII ChIPseq, mNETseq, GROseq, etc. However, it should be noted that strand-specific data is preferable where possible. The lack of strandedness lowers the number of possible read-in and readthrough genes (because the transcriptional signal can come from either direction). Additionally, DoG finding is unlikely to work well because of similar issues.\n\nFor RNA PolII ChIPseq, the following command is recommended for generating all necessary files:\n``` \nARTDeco -mode readthrough -gtf-file GTF_FILE -chrom-sizes-file CHROM_SIZES_FILE [-cpu NUM_CPU]\n```\nThe reason that the readthrough mode is specified is because DoG discovery in unstranded is not yet implemented and not easily interpreted. Thus, by choosing readthrough mode, you are saving run time. The only other relevant parameter is -readthrough-dist. This is double the default distance for placing the readthrough region. The main reason for this is because transcription termination often takes place before the polymerase disengages from the DNA according to the torpedo model of transcription termination in eukaryotes. Thus, there may be reads downstream of your genes that do not correspond to a defect in transcription termination. By increasing this distance, we avoid this and increase signal in systems that we suspect have transcriptional readthrough.\n\nARTDeco's file format inference for BAM files is going to be imperfect because RSeQC bases their inferences upon gene annotation. The more intergenic reads there are, the worse the inference is. For this reason, the user should try to specify the file format whenever possible.\n\nAnother consideration is the characteristics of your data. The default settings tend to work well for stranded total RNAseq, but be sure to examine your own data to see if the assumptions fit. For example, when using RNA PolII ChIPseq, it can be a good choice to set the readthrough distance to longer than default because that data typically has increased signal downstream of annotated transcription termination sites. Along these lines, users should be wary of comparing heterogeneous datasets as bias can affect interpretation. This highlights the need for understanding the nature of your data prior to applying a computational technique (always a good practice).  \n\nThe distribution of read-in and readthrough levels is generally reflective of total level of transcriptional readthrough present in a dataset. With this in mind, the median readthrough level (50% in the readthrough summary file for readthrough levels) is a good potential summary statistic for quantifying readthrough. However, you may want to filter for higher expressing genes as this leaves you less liable to fall victim to sources of error due to gene annotation and noise. This filtering is done automatically at a default of the top 1000 genes. The -summary-genes parameter allows you to adjust these genes. \n\nAdditionally, it may be a good idea to focus on certain gene sets for characterization of read-in/readthrough levels and assignment of read-in genes. Small RNAs and pseudogenes tend to have weird expression profiles and don't perform well on read-in inference as well as other analyses. For this reason, we have added a gene types option. If you want to know the possible gene types, perform the following command:\n```\ncut -f 2 preprocess_files/gene_types.txt | sort | uniq\n```\nThis well give you all of the gene types as specified by your GTF file. If there are no gene types in the GTF file, the gene_types.txt file will be empty. If you want to specify the gene types for the RNA PolII command above to search for protein coding genes and lincRNAs, you could run the following:\n``` \nARTDeco -mode readthrough -gtf-file GTF_FILE -chrom-sizes-file CHROM_SIZES_FILE [-cpu NUM_CPU] -gene-types protein_coding lincRNA\n```\nIt is recommended that you limit gene sets to these categories as they tend to be more reliable for evaluating readthrough.\n\nIf there are other concerns, I'll add them here."
