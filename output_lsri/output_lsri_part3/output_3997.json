        "value": "It is a Matlab-based, open-coded, fully automated brain functional connectivity network-based disease classification toolbox with user-friendly GUI that automatically conducts functional network construction, network feature extraction and selection, parameter optimization, classification, model validation, and result demonstration. It was designed to help neuroscientists, doctors, and researchers in other fields who have limited coding and machine learning knowledge to easily and correctly work on brain functional connectomics building with state-of-the-art algorithms [1-8] and conduct rigorous individualized disease diagnosis or other classification tasks. It is hoped that this toolbox could be of help in standardization the methodology and boost reproducibility, generalizability, and interpretability of the network-based classification.  \nSpecifically, BrainNetClass-v1.0 provides abundant algorithms for brain functional network construction, including those recently developed for high-order functional networks [1,4-6,8] and those utilizing sparse representation with advanced, biologically meaningful constraints for robust and consistent network construction [2,3,7]. What\u2019s more, it provides standard yet rigorous network-based classification with choices of feature extraction, feature reduction, cross-validation, and performance evaluation. Importantly, it goes further from providing simple metrics (e.g., accuracy) to a battery of more comprehensive results (e.g., receiver operating characteristic curve, parameter sensitivity test, model robustness test, contributing discriminative features, and a full log of results for a hassle-free report).  \nWith a simple configuration on a GUI interface, all these results and reports are just a few clicks away. All the processes will be automatically performed and results will be saved for users to evaluate the model and interpret the findings. More importantly, the model will be saved for future use on newly acquired data to perform a quick classification or diagnosis.  \nFor details, please see the manual. Exemplary toy data are provided for a quick walkthrough. Please contact Zhen Zhou (zzstefan@email.unc.edu), Han Zhang (hanzhang@med.unc.edu), and Dinggang Shen (dgshen@med.unc.edu) for any issues and suggestions. Your feedback is more than welcomed to help us improve it. If you feel it is helpful to your research, please cite the following papers. \n2.\tAdditional batch examples are added in a new folder named \u201c/BatchExamples\u201d. These batch examples allow users with certain programming skill to conveniently change the parameters and run BrainNetClass with a batch mode (command-line mode). The batch script \u201crun_EC_EO_demo.m\u201d is for users to run the entire analysis and it calls \u201cno_para_select_demo.m\u201d or \u201cparam_select_demo.m\u201d. The EC and EO data can be used as the exemplary data to run this batch example. \n3.\tA \u201csave_BrainNet.m\u201d script is added in the folder \u201c/BatchExamples\u201d. Users may use this it to generate any brain networks using the advanced network construction methods included in the BrainNetClass and save them for future usage, e.g., to perform group comparison analysis. By running this script, it will skip the classification part. Note: this can be done with command line mode only. \n4.\tAn \u201cinput_BrainNet.m\u201d script is added in the folder \u201c/BatchExamples\u201d so that users with their own built brain networks by using other methods or toolboxes can use them to perform further classification analysis with our BrainNetClass. This will skip the network construction part. Note: this can be done with command line mode only.\n \n"
