        ],
        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "Before running WEScall, you should first prepare a file, `samples.index`, containing a list of samples to call. \nEach line of `samples.index` contains 3 **tab-delimited** columns:\n\n```\n  [sampleID] [Absolute Path to BAM/CRAM file] [Contamination rate -- set to zero if unknown].\n```\n**THERE CANNOT BE EMPTY LINES IN `samples.index` FILE!** (This requirement might be relaxed later.) **The path to BAM/CRAM file should be absolute.** BAM/CRAM files listed are assumed to be aligned to `hs37d5.fa`, indexed by `samtools` and **all hard clipped reads has been set with flag 0x100**. If you are unsure about it, you could use option `-H` to check if this requirement is met. The checking process could take a long time.\n\nYou should also prepare a configure file specifying the chromosomes to call, the paths to the resources required by the pipeline and the type of sequencing data (WES or WGS). One example `user.cfg.yaml` in `${PL_DIR}/example/test_WES` is as following: \n\n```yaml\n  chrs: 1,2,10,20,X  \n  targetBed:  ${PL_DIR}/resources/SeqCap_EZ_Exome_v3_primary.bed\n  1KG3_panel: ${PL_DIR}/resources/1000G_ref_panel/\n  geneticMap: ${PL_DIR}/resources/geneticMap_GRCh37/\n  seqType:    WES\n```\nThe first line specifies which chromosomes you want to call. Chromosomes that can be called are chromosomes 1 to 22 and X. WEScall can not call variants from chromosome Y. You can specify multiple chromosomes one by one, delimited by comma (for example 20,22). \n\nThe second line specifies the target region bed file. It lists the targeted exonic regions with start and stop chromosome locations in GRCh37/hg19. Note, WEScall can also support the analysis of WGS samples, in which case the target region bed file is not necessary. \n\nThe third line specifies the location of the 1KG3 reference panel used for genotype phasing. See section 4.1.\n\nThe fourth line specifies the location of the genetic map files used for genotype phasing. \n\nThe fifth line specifies the type of the sequence data. The allowable values are WES and WGS.\n\nNow we can prepare the pipeline by using the following command:\n\n```bash\ncd ${WK_DIR} && python ${PL_DIR}/WEScall.py varCall -c user.cfg.yaml -s samples.index\n```\nBefore generating the files necessary for the running of the pipeline, checking of necessary resource files, dependencies and other stuff will be performed. After the checking, the folder `${WK_DIR}/varCall` will be generated, storing the execute script `${WK_DIR}/varCall/run.sh` and configure file `${WK_DIR}/varCall/cluster.yaml`. Users can modify these files before running the pipeline if necessary. \n\nIf you see message like ` WEScall.py Success! See instructions above.`, that means all checking has been passed (except the hard-clipped reads test if `-H` is not used), you can submit the variant calling master job using\n```\ncd varCall && qsub run.sh >> ./logs/submission.log  \n```\nIf any job is killed prematurely, you can resume the master job by using the command again. You can check `${WK_DIR}/varCall/logs/WEScall_varCall.master.log` for progress or diagnose premature terminations of jobs. \nIf the running is successful, the vcf files after SVM filtering are placed in, e.g.,  `${WK_DIR}/varCall/1/1.Filter.vcf.gz`\n\nOnce the log reports all jobs are done (message such as \"4 of 4 steps (100%) done\"), you can proceed to the next step.\n"
