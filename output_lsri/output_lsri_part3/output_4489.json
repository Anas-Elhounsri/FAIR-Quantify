PEWO has been attributed a 1.0.0 version tag. \n```  \n"

        "value": "PEWO compiles a set of workflows dedicated to the evaluation of phylogenetic placement algorithms and their software implementation. It focuses on reporting placement accuracy under different conditions and associated computational costs. \nIt is built on [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and relies extensively on the [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) and [Conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) repositories, making it portable to most OS supporting Python 3. A specific phylogenetic placement software can be evaluated by PEWO as long as it can be installed on said OS via conda. \n**Main purposes of PEWO:** \n1. Evaluate phylogenetic placement accuracy, given a particular reference species tree and corresponding reference alignment. For instance, one can run PEWO on different trees built for different taxonomic marker genes and explore which markers produce better placements. \n2. Given a particular software/algorithm, empirically explore which sets of parameters produces the most accurate placements, and at which computational costs. This can be particularly useful when a huge volume of sequences are to be placed and one may need to consider a balance between accuracy and scalability (CPU/RAM limitations). \n3. For developers, provide a basis to standardize phylogenetic placement evaluation and the establishment of benchmarks. PEWO aims to remove the hassle of re-implementing evaluation protocols that were described in anterior studies. In this regard, any phylogenetic placement developer is welcome to pull request new modules in the PEWO repository or contact us for future support of their new productions.\n \n"

        "value": "**1. Activate PEWO environment:**\n``` bash\nconda activate PEWO\n```\nBy default, the latest version of every phylogenetic placement software is installed in PEWO environment.\nIf you intend to evaluate anterior versions, you need to manually downgrade the corresponding package.\nFor instance, downgrading to anterior versions of PPlacer can be done with:\n``` bash\nconda uninstall pplacer\nconda install pplacer=1.1.alpha17\n```\n \nPEWO proposes several procedures aiming to evaluate different aspects of phylogenetic placement. Each procedure is coding as a Snakemake workflow, which can be loaded via a dedicated Snakefile (`PEWO_workflow/\\*.smk`). \nProcedure | Snakefile | Description\n--- | --- | ---\nPruning-based Accuracy evaluation (PAC) | `eval_accuracy.smk` | Given a reference tree/alignment, compute both the \"Node Distance\" and \"expected Node Distance\" for a set of software and a set of conditions. This procedure is based on a pruning approach and an important parameter is the number of prunings that is run (see documentation).\nRessources evaluation (RES) | `eval_ressources.smk` | Given a reference tree/alignment and a set of query reads, measures CPU/RAM consumptions for a set of software and a set of conditions. An important parameter is the number of repeats from which mean consumptions will be deduced (see documentation). \nLikelihood-based Accuracy evaluation (LAC) | `eval_likelihood.smk` | Given a reference tree and alignment, compute tree likelihoods induced by placements under a set of conditions, with a lower likelihood reflecting better placements. \n\nThe file `config.yaml` is where you setup the workflow. It contains 4 sections:\n* *Workflow configuration*\nThe most important section: set the working directory, the input tree/alignment on which to evaluate placements, the number of pruning experiments or experiment repeats (see procedures).\n* *Per software configuration*\nSelect a panel of parameters and parameter values for each software. Measurements will be operated for every parameter combination.\n* *Options common to all software*\nMostly related to the formatting of the jplace outputs. Note that these options will impact expected Node Distances.\n* *Evolutionary model*\nA very basic definition of the evolutionary model used in the procedures. Currently, only GTR+G (for nucleotides), JTT+G, WAG+G and LG+G (for amino acids) are supported.   \n**Notes on memory usage for alignment-free methods:**\nAlignment-free methods such as RAPPAS require to build/load a database in memory prior to the placement.\nThis step can be memory consuming for large datasets. Correctly managing the memory is done as follows: \n2. For instance, You conclude RAPPAS requires 8Gb per analysis. Then force RAPPAS to use 8Gb of RAM via the snakemake config file and the field:\n```yaml\nconfig_rappas:\n    memory: 8\n``` \n3. Finally choose the maximum amount of RAM that can be used by snakemake during its launch. For instance, if you have a machine with 32Gb of RAM :\n```\nsnakemake -p --cores 8 --resources mem_mb=32000 \\\n--snakefile eval_accuracy.smk \\\n--config workdir=`pwd`/examples/2_placement_accuracy_for_a_bacterial_taxonomy/run \\\n--configfile examples/2_placement_accuracy_for_a_bacterial_taxonomy/config.yaml\n```\nWith this setup, snakemake will wait for 8gb to be free before each RAPPAS launch and will run with a maximum of four RAPPAS launches in parallel (32/8=4). \nIt is strongly recommended to test if your configuration is valid and matches the analyses you intended.\nTo do so, launch a dry run of the pipeline using the command:\n``` bash\nsnakemake --snakefile [snakefile].smk -np\n```\n \nwhere `\\[snakefile\\]` is one of the sub-workflow snakefiles listed in the table above.  \nThis will list the operations that will be run by the workflow. It is also recommended to export a graph detailing the different steps of the workflow (to avoid very large graphs in \"Accuracy\" sub-workflow, we force a single pruning). \n"

        "value": "Before installation, the following packages should be available on your system must be installed on your system:\n\n* Python >=3.5\n* Miniconda3. Please choose the installer corresponding to your OS: [Miniconda dowloads](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n* GIT\n\nPEWO will look for the commands `git` and `conda`. Not finding these commands will cancel the PEWO installation.\n\nBelow are debian commands to rapidly install them:\n```\nsudo apt-get install git\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\nchmod u+x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n# when installation ask if you want to run conda init, answer yes\n# after installation ends, reload bash so that conda belongs to your PATH\nbash \n```\n\n### Installation\n\nDownload PEWO:\n``` bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/phylo42/PEWO.git\ncd PEWO\n```\n\nExecute installation script:\n``` bash\nchmod u+x INSTALL.sh\n./INSTALL.sh\n```\n\nAfter installation, load environment:\n``` bash\nconda activate PEWO\n```\n\nYou can launch a dry-run, if no error is throwed, PEWO is correctly installed:\n``` bash\nsnakemake -np \\\n--snakefile eval_accuracy.smk \\\n--config workdir=`pwd`/examples/1_fast_test_of_accuracy_procedure/run \\\n--configfile examples/1_fast_test_of_accuracy_procedure/config.yaml\n```\n\nYou can launch a 20 minutes test, using 2 CPU cores.\n\n``` bash\nsnakemake -p --cores 2 \\\n--snakefile eval_accuracy.smk \\\n--config workdir=`pwd`/examples/1_fast_test_of_accuracy_procedure/run \\\n--configfile examples/1_fast_test_of_accuracy_procedure/config.yaml\n```\n\nIf the test is successful, you should produce the following statistics and image files in the `examples/1_fast_test_of_accuracy_procedure/run` directory:\n* `results.csv`\n* `summary_plot_eND_epang_h1.svg`\n* `summary_plot_eND_pplacer.svg`\n* `summary_plot_eND_rappas.svg`\n\n\nThe content and interpretation of these files are detailed in the wiki documentation. \nPlease read the [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/phylo42/PEWO/wiki/IV.-Tutorials-and-results-interpretation).\n\n"
