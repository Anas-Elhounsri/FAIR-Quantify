First, each\nindividual dataset is analyzed with TnSeq2.sh. Then two different anlayses can be done. TnSeqDESeq2_DifferentialsAnalysis.R can be used to compare transposon mutant abundance between a control and\ntest condition. Alternatively, TnSeqDESeq2Essential_randomTn.R or TnSeqDESeq2Essential_mariner.R can be used to perform an essentials analysis (see https://www.pnas.org/content/112/13/4110) to identify genes required for growth under a certain condition.\nSee below for specific usage details and software dependencies. Please direct any\nquestions on their use or construction to Keith H. Turner (khturner at utexas.edu). \nAs of May 2015, this version of scripts is maintained by Sean Leonard (sean.p.leonard at utexas.edu).\nScripts were updated to use DEseq2 for analyses. \nAs of April 2019, these version of scripts have been updated by Carolyn Ibberson (carolyn.ibberson at biosci.gatech.edu) and Gina Lewin (gina.lewin at biosci.gatech.edu) in the Whiteley lab at Georgia Tech.\n \n"
