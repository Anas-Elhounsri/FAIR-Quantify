        "value": "The RiboDiPA R package executes four major functions to perform differential pattern analysis of Ribo-seq data, with optional visualization of results. An overview of the process can be seen in Figure 1:  \nA) **GTF file parsing and exon merging**: For a given gene, all exons annotated in the GTF file are merged into a total transcript. This provides a global picture of changes across conditions for a gene, as the total transcript will capture changes in ribosome occupancy even when transcript isoform usage might change across conditions. \nB) **BAM file processing and P-site mapping**: The Ribo-seq alignment files (.bam) are processed to calculate the P-site position for each RPF, with adaptable rules that users\u2019 can specify to call P-sites from the data. The mapped P-site frequency at each nucleotide position along the total transcript is compiled for each gene of each sample. \nC) **Data binning**: To overcome the inherent sparseness of Ribo-seq data, P-site positions are merged into bins using one of three methods: 1) an adaptive bin-width method that varies by gene, based on the Freedman-Diaconis rule 2) a fixed bin width method (as small as a single codon) that the user may specify, or 3) binning  by exon, using boundaries specified in the GTF file.  \nD) **Differential pattern analysis**: Pattern analysis of genes is performed on binned data for a given gene, comparing bin by bin across conditions to identify regions with statistically significant differences. The results of this testing are output as <em>p</em>-values and <em>q</em>-values for each gene. Additionally, a supplementary statistic, the <em>T</em>-value, is also produced to identify genes with a larger changes across conditions among significant genes, and is calculated based on a singular value decomposition procedure. <em>T</em>-value is intended to account for both the magnitude and number of differential bins, thus providing a way to prioritize subsets of significant genes for further investigation. \nOptionally: **Visualization of Ribo-seq footprints**: RiboDiPA also provides functionality for the visualization of mapped P-site frequency data for a given gene, as well as the binned data directly used for testing, with significantly different bins marked.\n \n"

It presumes that you have successfully installed RiboDiPA package from Bioconductor. \nThe data provided for the purposes of the vignette are adapted from Kasari et al, and represent a high-quality dataset collected in yeast. These data compare wild type cells to cells depleted for New1, which was shown by the authors to be a regulator involved in translation termination. As is often the case for data included in vignettes, the provided files are subsets of the full data set, and are intended to illustrate the functionality of RiboDiPA. We note that a typical full-scale analysis of real data for most users will be computing intensive. The computing time depends upon the number of samples, the sequencing depth of the samples, and the complexity of the organism, in terms of number of genes and exons. For example, the total computing time of the wild type versus New1 comparison (4 samples) on a 20-core node is about 10 minutes. RiboDiPA utilizes the parallel computing functionality of R and automatically detects the number of cores available to run jobs in parallel and improve performance. While a personal computer is more than sufficient for the illustration purposes of this vignette, for optimal performance with real data, we recommend that users run RiboDiPA on a server or computing cluster.\n \n"

These BAM files were subset on the interval chrIV:553,166-581,762 using samtools, which is a roughly 30kb region that contains 16 genes. Alternatively, users can declare the names of their BAM files directly in a vector.\n```r\n## Get the GTF file used for alignment\ngtf_file <- paste0(dest, \"eg.gtf\")\n```\nWe recommend that users utilize the identical GTF file used to produce the experimental alignments. For example, a GTF file sourced from Ensembl will not work with BAM files aligned with a GTF file sourced from UCSC. The GTF file, \"eg.gtf\", provided in the package is adapted from Ensembl, Saccharomyces cerevisiae release R64-1-1, and only contains features on chromosome IV. Users may also declare their GTF file directly.\n```r\n## Make the class label for the experiment\nclasslabel <- data.frame(\n    condition = c(\"mutant\", \"mutant\", \"wildtype\", \"wildtype\"),\n    comparison = c(2, 2, 1, 1)\n)\nrownames(classlabel) <- names.sample\n```\nThe class label determines the comparison performed by RiboDiPA, and minimally requires a column named `comparison` which labels the reference condition \"1\" and the treatment condition \"2\", with the option of including conditions that should not be compared labeled with \"0\". In this case \"wildtype\" represents the reference condition, and \"mutant\" represents the treatment.\n```r\n## Run the RiboDiPA pipeline with default parameters\nresult.pip <- RiboDiPA(bam_file_list, gtf_file, classlabel, cores = 2)\n```\nThe `RiboDiPA()` function is a wrapper function that calls all other necessary functions in the package. The default approaches for this wrapper are to do automatic generation of P-site offsets and adaptive binning of the mapped P-sites, although all parameters available in the other functions of the package are available to be modified in the wrapper.\n \n\n```r\n## View the table of output from RiboDiPA\nhead(result.pip$gene[order(result.pip$gene$qvalue), ])\n#>               tvalue       pvalue       qvalue\n#> YDR050C   0.07135543 1.039896e-18 8.215177e-17\n#> YDR064W   0.06267031 5.501646e-07 2.173150e-05\n#> YDR062W   0.04701957 3.319300e-02 8.740823e-01\n#> YDL007C-A 0.00000000 9.999990e-01 1.000000e+00\n#> YDL013W   0.01329390 8.645236e-01 1.000000e+00\n#> YDL017W   0.00000000 9.999989e-01 1.000000e+00\n```\nThe `RiboDiPA()` function outputs a list of genes with their <em>T</em>-value, <em>p</em>-value, and adjusted <em>p</em>-values indicated, stored in the value `gene`, along with other intermediate data objects used in the calculation. In most cases, we expect that users will sort by the adjusted <em>p</em>-value in order to see the most significant genes genome-wide, which we show above. Genes YDR049-YDR065 are located within the interval selected for this vignette, and we can clearly see highly significant gene hits with TPI1 and RPS13 (YDR050C and YDR064W, respectively), with <em>q</em>-values of 8.22e-17 and 2.17e-05.  \nThis completes the bare minimum requirements for finding genes with significant differential patterns, and subsequent sections will walk through the corresponding functions in more detail.\n \n"

In practice, RPFs that have been aligned to\nthe genome have different lengths, therefore a procedure is required to \nmap a given RPF to a P-site position to get a clear picture of ribosome \ntranslational activity. The `psiteMapping()` function will take the input\ndata, and use user-specified rules to map RPFs to P-sites, or generate \nthose rules automatically using the procedure described in Lauria et al\n(2018). Additionally, if there are multiple transcript isoforms in a \nsample that utilize the same exon in the genome, in can be difficult (or \nimpossible) to assign a given RPF to a particular transcript in a Ribo-seq\nexperiment. RiboDiPA circumvents this problem by combining all exons into\na \"total transcript\" and performs testing at the gene level. Therefore, \nin addition to the P-site offset generation and mapping, the `psiteMapping()`\nfunction also generates total transcript coordinates for each exon.\n```r\n## Perform individual P-site mapping procedure\ndata.psite <- psiteMapping(bam_file_list = bam_file_list, \n    gtf_file = gtf_file, psite.mapping = \"auto\", cores = 2)\n```\nP-site mapping outputs a list of values: `coverage`, the coverage across \neach gene; `counts`, the number of P-sites counts per gene; `exons`, the\ntotal transcript coordinates for each exon in the genome; and `psite.mapping`, the P-site mapping offsets. For the `coverage` object, rows correspond to replicates and columns correspond to nucleotide positions with respect to the total transcript. Similarly, for the `counts` object, rows represent genes and columns represent samples. Now, let us examine the offsets generated automatically by the function:\n \n```r\n## P-site mapping offset rule generated\ndata.psite$psite.mapping\n```\nThe read length of the RPF is listed (`qwidth`), followed by the nucleotide offset from the 5' end (`psite`). For instance, reads of length 28 have an offset of 12, meaning that the P-site will be mapped 12 nucleotides from the 5' end of the read.  \nAs mentioned above, the optimal P-site offsets from the 5' end of reads is calibrated using a two-step algorithm on start codons genome-wide, closely following the procedure of Lauria et al (2018). First, for a given read length, the offset is calculated by taking the distance between the first nucleotide of the start codon and the 5' most nucleotide of the read, and then defining the offset as the 5' position with the most reads mapped to it. This process is repeated for all read lengths and then the temporary global offset is defined to be the offset of the read length with the maximum count. Lastly, for each read length, the adjusted offset is defined to be the one corresponding to the local maximum found in the profiles of the start codons closest to the temporary global offset.  \nIn case of insufficient reads mapped to the start codons, we recommend \nusers to use the `center` option to take the center of the read as the \nP-site, or to provide their own offset rules by simply using a matrix \nwith two columns, labeled `qwidth` and `psite`, passed into the \n`psite.mapping` parameter of the `psiteMapping()` function. We note \nthat specifying fixed rules for the P-site offsets might be especially \nuseful when comparing across different experiments collected in the same \norganism, to insure consistency in the comparison.\n```r\n## Use user specified psite mapping offset rule\noffsets <- cbind(qwidth = c(28, 29, 30, 31, 32), \n    psite = c(18, 18, 18, 19, 19))\ndata.psite2 <- psiteMapping(bam_file_list, gtf_file, \n    psite.mapping = offsets, cores = 2)\n```\n \nLastly, the `psiteMapping()` function uses the parallel computing package\ndoParallel to speed up the process of mapping P-sites. To utilize this \nfeature, specify the number of cores available for the job using the \n`cores` parameter. If `cores` is not specified, this function will \nautomatically detect the number of cores on your computer to run jobs\nin parallel.\n \n"

In each matrix, rows correspond to replicates, and columns \ncorrespond to bins. If the parameter `bin.width` is not specified or set \nto zero, this indicates that the function will run in the adaptive binning \nmode (as opposed to fixed-width mode, see below). In general, we recommend \nto use adaptive binning, due to the fact that most Ribo-seq experiments \nare sparse and have few numbers of reads, on a per codon basis. \nIf the `zero.omit` argument is set to `TRUE`, bins with all zeros across \nall replicates are removed from the differential pattern analysis. When \nthe length of total transcript is not an integer multiple of the bin width,\nbinning will start from the 5' end if `bin.from.5UTR` argument is `TRUE`,\nor from the 3' end otherwise. In general, bin width is equal for every bin\nacross the total transcript, except for the last two bins, which are \nadjusted to prevent the last bin from being very small in the case where \nthe bin width does not divide the total transcript length evenly.\n```r\n## Merge the P-site data on each codon\n## Merge the P-site data on each codon\ndata.codon <- dataBinning(data = data.psite$coverage, bin.width = 1, \n    zero.omit = FALSE, bin.from.5UTR = TRUE, cores = 2)\n```\nIn cases where coverage permits, users can also specify a fixed width of bin, all the way down to 1, which represents single-codon resolution. This can be useful for examining details at regions that are very likely to have changes in translational regulation, namely near the start and stop codons. For instance, we examined 50 codons upstream and downstream of the stop and start codons respectively to identify a patterns of stacked ribosomes near the stop codon in the case of New1 deletion (see Li et al, 2020).\n \n```r\n## Merge the P-site data on each exon and perform differential pattern analysis\nresult.exon <- diffPatternTestExon(psitemap = data.psite, \n    classlabel = classlabel, method = c('gtxr', 'qvalue'))\n```\nIn cases where users would prefer to use exons as the bins for statistical \ntesting, we have provided a function called `diffPatternTestExon()`. This \nfunction rolls data binning and differential pattern testing into one function\nand outputs the same structure qw `diffPatternTest()` function. For organisms \nlike yeast where alternative splicing is minimal, this option may not be very \nuseful, but for higher organisms with many exons and much more alternative \nsplicing, it may provide useful insight.\n \n"
