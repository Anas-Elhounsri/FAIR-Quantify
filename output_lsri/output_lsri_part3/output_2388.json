The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

[Bibtex](#bibtex)\n\n## Introduction <a name=\"introduction\">\nCellTracker is a highly integrated graphical user interface software, for automated cell segmentation and tracking of time-lapse microscopy images. It covers essential steps in image analysis including project management, image pre-processing, cell segmentation, cell tracking, manually correction, and statistical analysis such as the quantification of cell size and fluorescence intensity, etc. Furthermore, CellTracker provides an annotation tool and supports model training from scratch, thus proposing a flexible and scalable solution for customized dataset analysis.\n<div align='center'><img align=\"middle\" src=\"imgs/interface.png\" width=\"70%\" /><br></div>\n\n\n## Environment Setup <a name=\"environment-setup\">\n\n**Env Requirements:** \n- MAC OS, Linux or Windows.\n- Python 3.5+.\n- PyTorch 1.4 or higher.\n- CUDA 9.2 or higher if you need train deep learning model with gpu.\n\n**Steps of using CellTracker:** \n\n0. Install Python ref to [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n\n1. Install CellTracker in virtualenv to keep your environment clean:\n\n    ##### on macOS/Linux\n    ```\n    pip install virtualenv  \n    # or \n    pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple virtualenv \n\n    virtualenv --python=python3 CellTrackerEnv\n    cd CellTrackerEnv\n    source ./bin/activate\n    ```\n    Optional: After use, shutdown virtual environment with\n    ```\n    deactivate\n    ```\n\n    ##### on Windows (open cmd with administrator's permission)\n    ```\n    pip install virtualenv  \n    # or \n    pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple virtualenv \n    virtualenv --python=python3 CellTrackerEnv \n    cd CellTrackerEnv\n    .\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n    ```\n    Optional: Shutdown virtual environment with\n    ```\n    .\\Scripts\\deactivate.bat\n    ```\n\n2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), this step is optional if you does not install CellTracker by git clone. Clone the source codes with git. \n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/WangLabTHU/CellTracker.git\n    ```\n    To boost download speeds, you could clone CellTracker from the source in the mainland of China.\n    ```\n    git clone https://gitee.com/ecart18/cell-tracker.git\n    ```\n3. or, download the source codes and extract files and put it in the virtual environment directory you defined. \n\n4. after 2/3, the directory of CellTracker should have the following structure:\n    \n    ```\n    CellTrackerEnv\n        cell-tracker\n            |-------main.py\n            |\n            |-------cell_tracker\n                    |...\n                    |...\n            |-------datasets\n                    |...\n            |-------log\n            |-------output\n            |-------training_demo1\n            |-------training_demo2\n            |...\n        |...\n    ```\n\n5. After the extraction, download all dependencies with the following commend.\n    ```\n    cd cell-tracker\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n    To boost download speeds, you could setup pip mirror such as\n    ```\n    pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -r requirements.txt  \n    # or\n    pip install -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple  -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n    It is recommended to use the official website to install pytorch.\n    ```\n    # CPU version\n    pip install torch==1.4.0+cpu torchvision==0.5.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n    # GPU version\n    pip install torch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n    ```\n\n6. Run CelTracker with python and enjoy it. \n    ```\n    python main.py\n    ```\n\n**Steps of re-training deep learning model:** \n\nCellTracker provides two methods to re-train deep CNN networks for your customized datasets. \n\n**Warning:** Linux is strongly recommended for training deep learning model. Re-training with the Python API in a Linux terminal can avoid some unexpected environment dependency errors.\n\n0. re-training with User Interface.\n\n1. re-training with Python API in terminal.  CellTracker provides two demo datasets and codes to help you get familiar with this feature, such as: \n    ```\n    cd training_demo1  \n    # or cd training_demo2\n    python retraining.py\n    ```\n\n**Pretrained models download:** \n\nCellTracker provides two pretrained models for dataset of training_demo1 and training_demo2 respectively. Download them from the following link.\n- [demo1 pretrained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wekBJbzG8m5EyeeyVqx56vhdz_TnIxab/view?usp=sharing)\n- [demo2 pretrained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HyqStKlTPX_K94F6n2OHytSzs40zffU8/view?usp=sharing)\n\n"
