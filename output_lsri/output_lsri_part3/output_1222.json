        "value": "CloudBridge provides a consistent layer of abstraction over different\nInfrastructure-as-a-Service cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need\nto write conditional code for each cloud. \nTo `get started`_ with CloudBridge, export your cloud access credentials\n(e.g., AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY for your AWS credentials) and start\nexploring the API: \nN. Goonasekera, A. Lonie, J. Taylor, and E. Afgan,\n\"CloudBridge: a Simple Cross-Cloud Python Library,\"\npresented at the Proceedings of the XSEDE16 Conference on Diversity, Big Data, and Science at Scale, Miami, USA, 2016.\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2949550.2949648 \n2. Have a suite of conformance tests which are comprehensive enough that goal\n   1 can be achieved. This would also mean that clients need not manually test\n   against each provider to make sure their application is compatible. \n3. Opt for a minimum set of features that a cloud provider will support,\n   instead of  a lowest common denominator approach. This means that reasonably\n   mature clouds like Amazon and OpenStack are used as the benchmark against\n   which functionality & features are determined. Therefore, there is a\n   definite expectation that the cloud infrastructure will support a compute\n   service with support for images and snapshots and various machine sizes.\n   The cloud infrastructure will very likely support block storage, although\n   this is currently optional. It may optionally support object storage. \n4. Make the CloudBridge layer as thin as possible without compromising goal 1.\n   By wrapping the cloud provider's native SDK and doing the minimal work\n   necessary to adapt the interface, we can achieve greater development speed\n   and reliability since the native provider SDK is most likely to have both\n   properties. \n\nContributing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCommunity contributions for any part of the project are welcome. If you have\na completely new idea or would like to bounce your idea before moving forward\nwith the implementation, feel free to create an issue to start a discussion. \nContributions should come in the form of a pull request. We strive for 100% test\ncoverage so code will only be accepted if it comes with appropriate tests and it\ndoes not break existing functionality. Further, the code needs to be well\ndocumented and all methods have docstrings. We are largely adhering to the\n`PEP8 style guide`_ with 80 character lines, 4-space indentation (spaces\ninstead of tabs), explicit, one-per-line imports among others. Please keep the\nstyle consistent with the rest of the project. \nConceptually, the library is laid out such that there is a factory used to\ncreate a reference to a cloud provider. Each provider offers a set of services\nand resources. Services typically perform actions while resources offer\ninformation (and can act on itself, when appropriate). The structure of each\nobject is defined via an abstract interface (see\n``cloudbridge/providers/interfaces``) and any object should implement the\ndefined interface. If adding a completely new provider, take a look at the\n`provider development page`_ in the documentation. \n"

        "description": "* This is a major release which contains many improvements and some breaking\r\n  changes to the interface, but the changes are fairly straightforward.\r\n* Support for Google Cloud (thanks to @mbookman, @chiniforooshan, @baizhang)\r\n* Support for middleware, event listening and interception, allowing\r\n  CloudBridge to be extended without needing to modify library code (This is\r\n  also potentially useful for handling corner cases for specific clouds).\r\n* The mock provider is now available by default as a standard cloud provider,\r\n  which is useful for testing applications that use CloudBridge.\r\n* Providers now operate in a single zone, and therefore, all methods that\r\n  previously required the zone as a parameter no longer do. Specifically,\r\n  ``instance.create()``, ``volume.create()``, ``subnet.create()``,\r\n  ``subnet.get_or_create_default()`` are affected in services,\r\n  and ``snap.create_volume()`` is affected in resources. The provider's default\r\n  zone must now be specified through the provider config.\r\n* All exceptions that are generated by CloudBridge will now extend from\r\n  ``CloudBridgeBaseException``\r\n* The cloud package is deprecated and everything under it has been moved\r\n  one level up. For example, instead of\r\n  ``from cloudbridge.cloud.factory import CloudProviderFactory`` use\r\n  ``from cloudbridge.factory import CloudProviderFactory``.\r\n* Services are much more uniform now, and sub-services have been introduced\r\n  for greater uniformity. For example, ``net.create_subnet()`` is now\r\n  ``net.subnets.create()``\r\n* ``gateways.get_or_create_inet_gateway()`` is now simply\r\n  ``gateways.get_or_create()``\r\n* AWS instance types are now served through Amazon CloudFront for better\r\n  performance.\r\n* Miscellaneous bug fixes and improvements.",
