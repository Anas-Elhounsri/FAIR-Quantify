Having faced this problem myself I started developing my own tools three years ago. \nThis R package came about as the result of supervising a very talented post-graduate Clinical Neuroscience student (please see Credits). The student's project, titled *\"A Longitudinal Cohort Study of Migraine Preventative Medication Usage in UK CPRD\"* required immediate access to primary care clinical and prescription records of patients suffering with headache disorders. The CPRD data can be very overwhelming, especially to those with little experience in electronic healthcare records or the manipulation of large data sets. To mitigate this concern I decided to develop a drug-prescription themed R API. Whilst I was writing the R package my student was putting it to use, performing the analysis necessary to answer the research aims whilst reporting bugs and suggesting additional features. My goal is to build an R package that can interrogate CPRD records whilst requiring minimal R language experience from the user (although some experience goes a long way).  \n \n"

The first element holds a named-list (by the drug ID) of patient id vectors, the second entry reflects the first entry in structure but holds the event dates, and the third element is a data.frame of drug by number of first prescriptions on record. With all of this information, one is able to analysis each drug type by social-demographic factors (functions provided). </br>\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/acnash/RDrugTrajectory/blob/master/images/prescription_frequency.png\" width=\"450\" />\n    \n**Figure 1.** First drug prescription (matched to a disease event e.g., headache) frequency. </br> </br>\n</center>\n\nrdrugtrajectory can produce the data structure necessary to perform a mean cumulative function (MCF) over several groups. Having first filtered the cohort for only medication of interest, and MCF plot reveals prescription burden by social-demographic factors, for example by social deprivation scores (Figure 2), or whole cohort populations. </br>\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/acnash/RDrugTrajectory/blob/master/images/IMD_prescriptions.png\" width=\"450\" />\n    \n**Figure 2.** Cumulative drug prescriptions stratified by patient IMD score.</br></br>\n</center>\n\nThe first codedraft of rdrugtrajectory is able to plot the change in a patients medication starting from their first prescription (Figure 3).
