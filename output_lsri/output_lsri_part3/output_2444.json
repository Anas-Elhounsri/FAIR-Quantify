We summarize these features as \"breakpoint signature\". Breakpointer proceeds in three stages in capturing this signature. It is implemented in C++ and perl. Input is the file or files containing alignments of single-end reads against a reference genome (in .BAM format). Output is the predicted regions containing potential breakpoints of SVs (in .GFF format). To be able to read in .BAM files, Breakpointer requires bamtools API, which users should install beforehand.\n    \n \n"

It adopts a heuristic method in searching for local mapping signatures created by insertion/deletions (indels) or more complex structural variants(SVs). With current NGS single-end sequencing data, the output regions by Breakpoint mainly contain the approximate breakpoints of indels and a limited number of large SVs. Notably, Breakpointer can uncover breakpoints of insertions which are longer than the read length. Breakpointer also can find breakpoints of many variants located in repetitive regions. The regions can be used not only as a extra support for SV predictions by other tools (such as by split-read method), but also can serve as a database for searching variants which might be missed by other tools.
