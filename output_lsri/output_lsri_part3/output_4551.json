An older version of python can be installed by creating an environment as\n\n```\nconda create -n panaroo python=3.9\nconda activate panaroo\n```\n\nPanaroo can then be installed by running the following within a conda environment\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults 'panaroo>=1.3'\n```\n\nalternatively it is often faster to use the [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) solver. This can be installed by running\n\n```\nconda install mamba -c conda-forge\n```\n\nPanaroo can then be installed using\n\n```\nmamba install -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c defaults 'panaroo>=1.3'\n```\n\n### Manual\n\nInstall cd-hit using either conda or by following these [instructions](https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit).\n\nIf you would like to build multiple sequence alignments install the corresponding aligner (MAFFT by default). MAFFT can be installed using conda or by following these [instructions](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/source.html)\n\nAlternatively cd-hit and MAFFT can be installed using apt-get on some linux systems.\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install cd-hit\n\nsudo apt-get install mafft\n```\n\nDownload or clone the repository and install by running\n\n```\npip3 install git+https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo\n```\n        \nor alternatively\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo\ncd panaroo\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\nTo install locally, instead run\n\n```\npython3 setup.py install --user\n```\n\nPanaroo relies on a number of dependencies that must be installed separately.\n\n#### Dependencies\nRequired:\n* biopython\n* numpy\n* networkx\n* gffutils\n* edlib\n* joblib\n* tdqm\n* cd-hit\n\nOptional:\n* prokka\n* prank\n* mafft\n* clustal\n* mash\n"
