        "value": "DESCRIPTION\n    The genome of Bacteria and Archaea often contains several copies of the\n    16S rRNA gene. This can lead to significant biases when estimating the\n    composition of microbial communities using 16S rRNA amplicons or\n    microarrays or their total abundance using 16S rRNA quantitative PCR,\n    since species with a large number of copies will contribute\n    disproportionally more 16S amplicons than species with a unique copy.\n    Fortunately, it is possible to infer the copy number of unsequenced\n    microbial species, based on that of close relatives that have been fully\n    sequenced. Using this information, CopyRigher corrects microbial\n    relative abundance by applying a weight proportional to the inverse of\n    the estimated copy number to each species. \n    In metagenomic surveys, a similar problem arises due to genome length\n    variations between species, and can be corrected by CopyRighter as well. \n    In all cases, a community file is used as input (-i option) and a\n    corrected community file with trait-corrected (16S rRNA gene copy number\n    or genome length) relative abundances is generated (-o option). Total\n    abundance can optionally be provided (-t option), corrected and combined\n    with relative abundance estimates to get the absolute abundance of each\n    species. Also the average trait value in each community is reported on\n    standard output. \nREQUIRED ARGUMENTS\n    -i <input>\n        Input community file obtained from 16S rRNA microarray, 16S rRNA\n        amplicon sequencing or metagenomic sequencing, in biom, QIIME, GAAS,\n        Unifrac, or generic (tabular site-by-species) format. The file must\n        contain read counts (not percentages) and taxa must have UNALTERED\n        taxonomic assignments. Here is an example of Greengenes 2012/10\n        taxonomic string (note the whitespace after each semicolon): \n        See also the <data> parameter to specify your own database of trait\n        values. \nOPTIONAL ARGUMENTS\n    -d <data>\n        Provide the file of trait estimates to use for correction. Data\n        files of 16S rRNA gene copy number and genome length (based on IMG\n        4.0 genomes mapped onto the Oct 2012 Greengenes taxonomy) are\n        distributed with CopyRighter. In case you want to use an alternative\n        data file, be aware that it should be tab-delimited and have two\n        columns, an ID or taxonomic string (col 1), and trait estimate (col\n        2), as illustrated in this example: \n        Extra columns are ignored, as well as empty lines and comment lines\n        (starting with #). Note that the header line can define the name of\n        the weight used. Also, the file can contain trait values both at the\n        ID and taxstring level. \n        This argument is optional. When omitted, CopyRighter will look for\n        the data file location stored in the \"COPYRIGHTER_DB\" environment\n        variable. Feel free to make this variable point to your preferred\n        data file. \n    -l <lookup>\n        What to match when looking up the trait value of a taxon: 'desc',\n        use taxonomic description, or 'id', use OTU ID (if recorded in your\n        input community file). The script bc_use_repr_id of Bio::Community\n        can help in replacing arbitrary OTU IDs by their corresponding\n        Greengenes ID. Default: desc \n    -o <output>\n        Output path for the corrected community files (in same format as\n        input), with relative abundance expressed in percent. Default:\n        out_copyrighted.txt \n    -t <total>\n        File containing the total microbial abundance to be corrected by the\n        average trait value, e.g. 16S rRNA quantitative PCR numbers to be\n        corrected by the average 16S rRNA copy number in each community.\n        This file should be tab-delimited and contain two columns: community\n        name, and total abundance. Using this option will produce two\n        additional output files, one containing the corrected total\n        microbial abundance, and other the absolute abundance of each taxon\n        in the <input> (in the same format as <input>): assuming an <output>\n        called 'out_copyrighted.txt', these files will be named,\n        respectively, 'out_copyrighted_total.tsv' and\n        'out_copyrighted_combined.txt'. \n    -v  Verbose mode. Display trait value assignments. You should probably\n        use this option and make sure that your taxa are processed as\n        intended. \nHELP & FEEDBACK\n  Mailing list\n    New releases of CopyRighter, usage help and suggestions are discussed on\n    this mailing list: <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/copyrighter> \n  Bugs\n    All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this program is no\n    exception.
