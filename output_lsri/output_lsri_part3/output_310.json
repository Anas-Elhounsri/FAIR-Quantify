        "value": "\"Cliquely\" is tool that enables the exploration of the co-occurrence patterns of proteins across a wide range of 4,742 fully sequenced genomes from the three domains of life. The data underneath Cliquely covers more than 23 million proteins divided into 404,947 orthologous clusters.  \nBased on an entry protein of interest, the data set is used to construct a co-occurrence graph based on phylogenetic profiles, with edge weights representing co-occurrence probabilities. Users can direct Cliquely to work with the entire underlying data set, or specifically in the context of Bacteria, Archaea, or Eukaryota. The Bron\u2013Kerbosch algorithm is then used in order to detect maximal cliques in this graph, i.e. fully-connected subgraphs representing meaningful biological networks from different functional categories.  Cliquely's results shed light on functional relationships between proteins and protein families, in the context of different levels of taxonomic resolution and with unprecedented underlying data set. \n"

The user is asked to enter\nchoices - entry sequence, *Probability* (*P<sub>co</sub>*, in the range 0-1),\n*Max clique size*, *Max cliques*, dropdown menu for the \\\"*Search in*\\\"\noption. The program\\'s defaults is *P<sub>co</sub>* =0.7, this will perform well\nin in most cases, but users are encouraged to run Cliquely for a range\nof *P<sub>co</sub>* values, and choose the best *P<sub>co</sub>* for their purposes.\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21021560/149641219-b3519907-d2a9-4357-922f-544105b3034d.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\n2. After you have filled all of the required fields you may click on\n\\\"Search cliques\\\" and the program will start to calculate the cliques\nof the entered FASTA sequence, this process may take a few minute.\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21021560/149641223-f6a735f0-a75a-4f3f-a227-e8359e361f82.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\n3.
