The C++ code can be compiled and used as a static library without Matlab/Octave or Python. It is used by both the MATLAB and Python versions of Titta under the hood (Titta users can access it directly through the [`Titta.buffer` property](#properties)). \nBesides providing access to the same tracker functionality as the Tobii Pro MATLAB SDK, it has two main features: (1) more complete and granular access to the data streams: (a): support for both consuming (destructive) and peeking (non-destructive) data streams; (b): support for only accessing or clearing specific parts of the tracker's data streams; and (c) data provided as structs-of-arrays instead of arrays-of-structs which makes data access significantly simpler and is much more memory efficient. The second main feature is (2) asynchronous calibration methods, allowing to issue non-blocking method calls for all stages of the calibration process, such that the interface can remain responsive. It furthermore offers GNU Octave support, which the MATLAB SDK has dropped since version 1.10, and provides eye openness data alongside data in the gaze stream instead of in a separate stream that the user then has to link up later themselves. Finally, other functions implemented in [`TittaMex`](#titta-tittamex-tittapy-classes) provide return values that are a bit friendlier to use in MATLAB/Octave, in the author's opinion (e.g. `double`s which are MATLAB's native data type instead of `single`s) and no use of MATLAB classes to just hold plain data. \nOn the Python side, besides the above benefits, use of the `Titta` C++ wrapper in [`TittaPy`](#titta-tittamex-tittapy-classes) prevents issues where data is lost with the Tobii Python SDK's callback-style interface if the user does not sleep or yield often enough in their code, and also provides data from the various streams as a dict-of-lists instead of a list-of-dicts, which in the author's opinion is easier to use, and is straightforwardly transformed to a `pandas.DataFrame`, or saved to an HDF5 file.\n \n"

Here are instructions for these two routes:\n1. Using Git\n    1. install git from https://git-scm.org if you don't already have it. If you do not\n       like using the command line/terminal, consider using a graphical git tool such as\n       [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/), which is available free for non-commercial use.\n    1. Download Titta and its dependencies in one go using the following command:\n       `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git://github.com/dcnieho/Titta.git`.\n    1. Should this not work due to your git version being too old, try executing the\n       following commands:\n       ```\n       git clone git://github.com/dcnieho/Titta.git`\n       cd Titta\n       git submodule update --init --recursive\n       ```\n       If you have already cloned Titta but do not have the MatlabWebSocket submodule populated yet,\n       issuing the `git submodule update --init --recursive` command will take care of that.\n1. Manual download:\n    1. First download Titta and place it, unzipped if necessary, in your preferred folder.\n    1. Then download MatlabWebSocket (available from https://github.com/jebej/MatlabWebSocket). Download the [currently tested version](https://github.com/jebej/MatlabWebSocket/tree/7454ab1564d3142a643a4d381f67206698abb8d6).\n    1. Put the MatlabWebSocket directory inside Titta at the right location:\n      `<tittaRootDir>/talkToProLab/MatlabWebSocket`).\n1. When running on Windows, ensure you have the latest version of the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) installed. This is the most likely cause of errors like \"The specified module could not be found\" when loading the TittaMex file.\n \n"

Unfortunately, the Pro upgrade license key is no longer sold by Tobii Pro.

Interact with the eye tracker using the below API.\n5. When calling `Titta.calibrate()`, a participant setup and calibration and validation interface is shown. For each screen, several keyboard hotkeys are available to activate certain functionality. By default, the hotkey for each button is printed in the button's label. It can be configured to different keys with the `settings.UI.button` options [listed below](#supported-options). In addition, a few global hotkeys are available. These are documented below in the API documentation of the `Titta.calibrate()` method. A more advanced participant setup, calibration and validation interface intended especially to enable work with participants who are unable to follow instructions such as infants and non-human primates is provided by the `Titta.calibrateAdvanced()` function. The validation screen of both interfaces lists the data quality of the gaze signal recorded during validation, see below for [a description of the reported data quality metrics](#validation-screen).\n6. Example analysis scripts for the recorded data (fixation classification and AOI analysis) are [also provided](demo_analysis).\n"

These metrics are also converted to text by `Titta.getValidationQualityMessage()` and this text is stored as a timestamped message in the Titta message stream (see `Titta.getMessages()`) as part of the validation procedure. This message as well as the calibration data from which it is generated is stored to file by most of the data saving functions in Titta (see details in the documentation of each function, it depends on the format's capabilities). See [this script](demo_analysis/a_validationAccuracy.m) for an example of extracting the data quality metrics of a validation from the `.mat` files stored by `Titta.saveData()`.\n\nFor validation, by default, 0.5 s of gaze data is collected per validation point (see [`settings.val.collectDuration`](#supported-options)). The metrics calculated for the data of each validation point are decribed below. The metrics are calculated in the private function `getDataQuality()` inside [`Titta.m`](Titta.m) separately for the left and right eye (if both are recorded).\n\n|Metric|data field|description|\n|---|---|---|\n|Offset (accuracy)|`acc1D` and `acc2D`|The \"accuracy is the closeness of the gaze position reported by the eye-tracking setup to the actual gaze position of the participant\" ([Niehorster, Santini et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-019-01307-0)), which in Titta is operationalized as the average offset of the recorded gaze positions from the validation target. `acc1D` is the average of the Euclidian distances of each sample from the target, whereas `acc2D` contains the average signed horizontal and vertical offsets from the target (these can be zero when `acc1D` is not, for instance when the gaze samples spread evenly around a validation target).|\n|SD (precision)|`STD1D`|\"Precision is defined as the closeness of a set of repeated gaze position measurements obtained under identical conditions (i.e., obtained from an eye that has not rotated)\" ([Niehorster, Zemblys et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01400-9)). STD indicates the spatial spread of a sequence of gaze points (more precisely it is a measure of dispersion around the centroid of a sequence of gaze positions). As per equation 2 in [Niehorster, Zemblys et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01400-9), it is computed as the square-root of the sum of the horizontal and vertical variance of the recorded gaze positions.|\n|RMS (precision)|`RMS1D`|RMS in Titta refers to RMS-S2S precision, or \"the root mean square of the displacement between successive gaze positions\", which loosely speaking gives an indication of how spiky the gaze signal is ([Niehorster, Zemblys et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01400-9)).|\n|Data loss|`dataLoss`|Data loss (for an extensive discussion, see [Hooge et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-022-02010-3)) is calculated as the percentage of recorded gaze samples that is marked as invalid by the eye tracker.|\n"
