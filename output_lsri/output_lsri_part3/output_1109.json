If pak gives you the error `Bad GitHub credentials` then either update your GitHub personal access token (or equivalent), or use devtools.\n\nOnce everything is installed and the various inputs are assembled, running InvertypeR is straightforward. The function `invertyper_pipeline()` will create composite files for an individual, attempt to discover putative inversions using [BreakpointR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/breakpointR.html) and the genotype them if desired, and of course genotype a user-provide list of putative inversions as well. It can also save the composite files as .RData files and write any inversions it finds to UCSC Genome Browser files along with the relevant Strand-seq reads. \n\nMany of these steps can also be run separately: for example, `create_composite_files()` creates composite files and `invertyper()` does the actual genotyping once composite files and putative inversions (genomic regions to genotype) are identified. \n\nOne important argument is `adjust_method`, which controls how InvertypeR tries to adjust the provided inversion coordinates before or after genotyping. This is useful because published inversion coordinates are often inaccurate, so both inverted and non-inverted Strand-seq reads will be caught during the genotyping step. If you want to genotype the exact coordinates you provided with no alterations, choose `adjust_method=\"raw\"`. But InvertypeR can also try to find better coordinates for putative inversions by looking for switches in the orientation of Strand-seq reads nearby the coordinates provided. This can be done only for inversions that had confident non-reference genotypes when the original coordinates were used (`adjust_method=\"deltas\"`), or it can even be done for less confident inversions to see whether there was a problems with the coordinates provided (`adjust_method=\"all\"`).\n\nFor more detail about the various functions in the InvertypeR package, for example for the main wrapper script, write `?invertyper_pipeline` or `?create_composite_files`, etc.\n"

Most commonly, a large (real) inversion or reference misorient can reorient so many reads that InvertypeR has trouble identifying strand states nearby, so it just doesn't use reads from that region or chromosome. The solution is to find the coordinates of those regions (typically using [BreakpointR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/breakpointR.html)), and provide them to InvertypeR using the `soft_mask` argument. Reads from those regions will appear in composite files and be used for inversion calling (so the large inversion/misorient won't be overlooked), but they won't be used to identify strand states to MAKE the composite files. This often appears as a chromosome that has way fewer reads than other chromosomes (see below). However, some variation in coverage between chromosomes is expected, especially when a low-coverage chromosome in one composite file (e.g., Watson-Watson, or WW) has high coverage in the other composite file (e.g., Watson-Crick or WC). \n\nFor humans, the big inversion on chr8 very occasionally causes this problem, or in some males the large inversion at the start of chrY. The coordinates for these using GRCh38 are chr8:8129404-12608295 and chrY:6240762-9910296, respectively. Even if you don't expect to have composite file creation issues, it would be reasonable to put them in a BED file and pass them to InvertypeR using `soft_mask` as a preventative measure. \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/vincent-hanlon/InvertypeR/blob/main/composite_errors.png\" width=680>\n<strong>Figure 1. </strong><em>An example of a non-human WW composite file with an error caused by reference assembly misorients on chromosome 16 (green bumps). </em>\n<br>\n<br>\n\nOther rare issues: If you know that a large heterozygous inversion (>2 Mb) is present in your sample but it doesn't appear in the WC composite file (or it appears, but with an unclear strand switch that has high background), something may be wrong with phasing.

These links usually expire after a week or so, but they can be quite useful for exploring inversion calls. The linked ideograms are created by running accessory R/bash/perl scripts as described below.\n\nDependencies:\n  - *tool (version we use)*\n  - R (3.5.1)\n  - R package dplyr (0.8.5)\n  - R package gridExtra (2.3)\n  - R package ggplot2 (3.3.0)\n  - R package data.table (1.12.8)\n  - R package psych (2.0.9)\n  - ImageMagick (7.0.10-0)\n  - python package img2pdf (0.4.0)\n  - perl package PDF::API2 (2.038)\n  - perl package LWP::UserAgent (6.49)\n  \n(Courtesy of Victor Guryev and Carl-Adam Mattsson)\n\nThese scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/mattssca/haploplotR), along with more detailed instructions. In brief, clone the repository, install the dependencies, put an InvertypeR output file in the `in/` directory, and put the browserfiles for the WW and WC composite files (from `write_browser_files()`, below) in the `in/bed_reads/` directory. Then run `bash haploplot_run.sh`. A PDF ideogram linked to a UCSC Genome Browser session will be created automatically.\n\nThe required browserfiles can now be created as follows, if `create_composite_files()` or `invertyper_pipeline()` were run with `save_composite_files=T`:\n\n```\nload(\"./WW_composite_file.RData\")\nload(\"./WC_composite_file.RData\")\nwrite_UCSC_browser_files(WW_reads=WW_composite_file, WC_reads=WC_composite_file, paired_reads=TRUE)\n```\n"

        "value": "Composite file creation isn't perfect. The function `create_composite_files()` generates a PDF of each composite file created, which you should inspect for anomalies. Most commonly, a large (real) inversion or reference misorient can reorient so many reads that InvertypeR has trouble identifying strand states nearby, so it just doesn't use reads from that region or chromosome. The solution is to find the coordinates of those regions (typically using [BreakpointR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/breakpointR.html)), and provide them to InvertypeR using the `soft_mask` argument. Reads from those regions will appear in composite files and be used for inversion calling (so the large inversion/misorient won't be overlooked), but they won't be used to identify strand states to MAKE the composite files. This often appears as a chromosome that has way fewer reads than other chromosomes (see below). However, some variation in coverage between chromosomes is expected, especially when a low-coverage chromosome in one composite file (e.g., Watson-Watson, or WW) has high coverage in the other composite file (e.g., Watson-Crick or WC). \n\nFor humans, the big inversion on chr8 very occasionally causes this problem, or in some males the large inversion at the start of chrY. The coordinates for these using GRCh38 are chr8:8129404-12608295 and chrY:6240762-9910296, respectively.
