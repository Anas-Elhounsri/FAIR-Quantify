It is capable of detecting novel STR expansions, that is expansions where there is no STR in the reference genome at that position (or a different repeat unit from what is in the reference). It can also detect STR expansions that are annotated in the reference genome. STRling uses kmer counting to recover mis-mapped STR reads. It then uses soft-clipped reads to precisely discover the position of the STR expansion in the reference genome. \n"

These loci are then genotyped in all samples.\r\n* Assign reads to bounds based on original cluster distances\r\n* provide STR disease loci for hg38\r\n* change default: no soft-clipped reads required for reporting loci\r\n* count repeats in overlapping reads (not just spanning) and don't report very high depth regions\r\n* only count STR loci that pass some size criteria when deciding if unplaced reads should be allocated\r\n* update bin file to hold version, frag dist, etc.\r\n* update linear models\r\n* Force reporting of loci from input files even if they have insufficient supporting reads (useful for comparing individuals across cohorts)\r\n\r\n## Minor features\r\n\r\n* Suppress reporting of several messages and output of read files to debug mode (spanning in particular can be very large for joint calling)\r\n* change column order of -bounds.txt to make it valid bed format and add header\r\n* add option to manually limit window for bounds\r\n* read both bounds and bed files as input at call and merge stage\r\n* anchored lm returns NaN when sum_str_counts is 0\r\n* set all bam threads to 0. Addresses #32 htslib error\r\n* basic end to end test run in CI for a single sample and 2 joint\r\n* update simulation to use merge and different insert sizes",
