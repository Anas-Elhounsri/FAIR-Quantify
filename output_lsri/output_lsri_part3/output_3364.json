The `padded` prefix allows for padding to be apart of the model, so no 16 padding logic is required. However, the layer used is incompatible with matlab, thus the matlab version has no pre-padding.\n\nThe `mimicknet_phantom_verasonics.h5` models were generated with only phantom data from verasonics.\n\nA notebook and sample data is provided under `examples` for use in the following environments:\n - [`matlab`](https://github.com/Ouwen/MimickNet/blob/master/examples/matlab_example_2019a.m)\n\n[Dr. Mark Palmeri's](https://github.com/mlp6) liver and kidney images are provided as test examples (Thanks Mark!)\n"
