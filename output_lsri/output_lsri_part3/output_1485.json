        "value": "# Contributing to this project.\n\nThis document is intended to be a brief cheatsheet for people wanting to contribute.\n\nWe have some short guides on how to use git, docker, and singularity etc.\nFor now while we're still developing the first version of the pipeline, this document is fine.\nOnce we publish (version 1), we'll need to re-organise these guidelines a bit to follow something more like the [git workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) model.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease don't edit the files in the wiki directly, modify them from this github repo.\nThe changes will be automatically pushed to the wiki when we make a new release.\n\nWe do this because we use version numbers the documentation a lot, so we use a tool to automatically change the version as we go.\nIt's not really practical to run this separated across multiple repos.\n\nAs you're writing documentation, make sure that your version numbers match the version of the current pipeline.\nAlso make sure that your file will be matched by one of the rules in the `.bumpversion.cfg` file.\nContact us if you need help with this :)\n\n\n## Git\n\nGit is a version control tool.\nIt tracks differences of *lines* between changes of text documents.\n\nThe basic workflow for using git with other people goes a bit like this:\n\n1. Clone (or fork and then clone) the repository to your computer with `git clone`.\n2. Create a new branch just for yourself with `git checkout -b my_branch_name`.\n3. Create changes to the code, or add or delete files.\n4. Add the files that you've created or modified to be tracked by git using `git add`.\n   This is called staging. It's like a declaration that these are changes that I want to keep.\n5. Commit the staged changes to your branch using `git commit`.\n   This creates a semi-permanent record of the files in the branch.\n6. Pull any changes to the master branch that your co-workers have made from github with `git pull`.\n   This will attempt to merge any changes with your changes, and you may have to resolve merge conflicts if you have both modified the same lines.\n7. Push your new branch with your special features added to the repository with `git push`.\n8. Create a \"pull-request\" to merge your branch with the master branch.\n   This allows other team members to review your changes, and it will check for merging conflicts again.\n9. Accept the pull request, to merge the branch back into master and make your changes available to other people.\n10. Repeat steps 3-9 using the your existing branch (or delete it and create a new branch if you want to rename it, the changes are now in master).\n\n\n#### important commands\n\nHere are some copy-pastable examples that you might use.\n\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:ccdmb/predector.git ./predector\n```\n\n\"Clone\" the repository to your computer to a new folder `predector`.\n\n\n```bash\ngit branch my_new_branch\ngit checkout my_new_branch\n\n# Shorthand for the two commands above\ngit checkout -b my_new_branch\n```\n\nCreate a new branch called `my_new_branch` and then tell git that you want to work in that new branch.\nTo switch back to the `master` branch (or any other branch or commit id) you can use:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master\n```\n\nIf you have made changes to a file that you haven't `commit`ted or `add`ed yet,\nyou can revert the file back to the last `commit`ed version by checking out the `HEAD` (the most recent commit in this branch).\nFor example say you had edited `README.md` and wanted to discard those changes.\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -- README.md\n```\n\nWould reset the file to the last commit state.\n\nTo \"stage\" files that you have modified and want to keep track of:\n\n```bash\n# Add all files in the current working directory\ngit add -A\n\n# Add a specific file with changes to be tracked.\ngit add README.md\n\n# Add a whole directory\ngit add bin/\n```\n\nTo see what files you have `add`ed, and that you have modified but not yet added you can check its \"status\".\n\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\n\nIf you decide that you want to unstage something that you've staged and haven't yet `commit`ed you can use.\nE.G. say you decided that you didn't want to stage the changes to files in `bin/` yet.\n\n```bash\ngit reset HEAD bin/\n```\n\nYour modifications will still be there but the file is no-longer engaged to be `commit`ed.\n\n\nWhen you're finished making changes you can `commit` the staged changes.\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"This is a message describing briefly what changes you've made.\"\n```\n\nIf you don't include the `-m` flag it will open up your default text-editor (usually nano) and you'll have to write a message in there.\nMake sure that any text after `-m` either doesn't have spaces or is quoted.\n\nTo integrate any changes that other people have made on the github repository `master` branch into your current branch.\n\n```bash\ngit pull origin master\n```\n\n`origin` is the name of the remote repository that you want to pull from.\nWhen you called `git clone` earlier, it automatically puts the github uri in the remotes names `origin`.\nYou can have multiple remotes, but we'll just be using `origin`.\nSo this command merges the content of the master branch into your currently checked out branch.\nTo merge master into your master branch, you first need to `checkout` master.\nTo merge a different branch, change `master` to the branch that you want.\n\nWhen you call `pull`, git will attempt to merge the changes into a single coherent set.\n**If** you and another person have both modified the same lines, you might receive a \"merge conflict\".\nDon't worry! It's not as complicated as you might think.\n\nGit will tell you which files have the conflicts and will mark the offending regions like so.\n\n\n```\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nThis might be some text in your current branch that you have modified.\n=======\nThis might be some text on the remote master branch that someone else has modified\nthat is in the same position in the file.\n>>>>>>> remote:master\n```\n\nTo resolve a merge conflict you need to manually merge the two chunks (separated by `=======`).\nUsually this involves deleting one option and keeping the other.\n\nOnce you've fixed the merge conflict blocks, you `add` the changes and `commit` them to your branch as you did before.\nIf any blocks with that `<<< HEAD` etc structure are still in your code, git will raise an error and tell you to fix it.\n\n\nTo \"push\" your changes to the remote repository you can do:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin my_new_branch\n```\n\nNote that the first time you push a new branch to the remote you should use the `-u` flag, to tell git that we want to track changes to this branch.\n\n```bash\ngit push -u origin my_new_branch\n```\n\n\nIf your changes are ready to be shared and for other people to use, you can open a pull-request on github to merge your branch into master.\n\n\nTo continue working you can just stay in the same branch and continue to create pull requests into master when you're ready to share.\nMore fancy people will create a new branch for every new \"feature\" that is going to be implemented, and those branches get removed when the new feature is finished and merged.\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe will try to follow the [\"semver\" guidelines](https://semver.org/).\n\nWe're using [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to automatically handle version increases.\nBecause we have to store the version in several places, doing this manually is very error prone so we let a program handle it all for us.\n\nVersions follow the standard semver `major.minor.patch` versioning scheme with optional `dev`, `alpha`, and `beta` pre-releases.\nIn the context of a bioinformatics pipeline, I interpret the tags like this:\n\n- \"Major\" version changes should be reserved for restructuring the pipeline, or major changes to the output formats.\n  E.G. Adding a lot of new analyses, removing analyses, new summarization and ranking methods etc.\n- \"Minor\" version changes are stable releases that don't really change the analysis or result formats much.\n  E.G. Updated versions and/or parameters for software or databases, performance upgrades, retrained models with new databases, new utilities or reporting features.\n- \"Patches\" are used for bug-fixes and very minor changes.\n- Pre-releases will be mostly for making sure that continuous integration stuff is working (e.g. conda environment pushes and docker automated builds) and for final checks before saying that something is \"stable\".\n  They'll also be useful if you're trying to debug the CI stuff, since we can create `-dev.1`, `-dev.2` versions to trigger builds on dockerhub but indicate that they aren't proper releases.\n  We should run `beta` releases through a few different realistic datasets to make sure everything is ok.\n  If you're sure that everything is ok, you can just skip through the pre-release stuff and straight into a patch release.\n\n\n#### Example version change commands\n\nWe have some copy-pastable commands that you can use below, but note that these will update several files, commit those changes, tag them with the new version, and push the changes and tags to github.\nYou'll need to be in the git repository root directory to run the commands because it looks for a file called `.bumpversion.cfg`.\nFor major and minor releases, you should add a brief message using the `--tag-message` argument.\nYou can also add a `--commit-message` if you like.\n\nTo bump the patch version:\n\n```bash\n# version 0.0.1\nbump2version patch\n# version 0.0.2-dev\n```\n\nBump the release version:\n\n```bash\n# version 0.0.1-alpha\n\nbump2version release\n# version 0.0.1-beta\n\nbump2version release\n# version 0.0.1\n\nbump2version release\n# version 0.0.2-dev\n\nbump2version release\n# version 0.0.2-alpha\n```\n\n\nTo trigger the automated builds but not indicate a stable version, use a pre-release:\n\n```bash\n# BEFORE: version 0.0.1-alpha\nbump2version pre\n# AFTER: version 0.0.1-alpha.1\n\n# BEFORE: version 0.0.1-beta.2\nbump2version pre\n# AFTER: version 0.0.1-beta.3\n\n# BEFORE: version 0.0.1\nbump2version pre\n# AFTER: version 0.0.2-dev\n```\n\n\nTo skip the pre-releases you need to manually specify what it should be updated to.\nIt's my feeling that the pre-releases should only ever be skipped for patch releases and when they have been pretty thoroughly tested.\nDon't just go straight from `0.1.1` to `0.2.0`, use `bump2version minor` instead to go to `0.2.0-alpha`.\n\n```bash\n# BEFORE: version 0.0.1-alpha\nbump2version --new-version 0.0.1\n# AFTER: version 0.0.1\n# Remember that alpha is a PRE-release\n\n# BEFORE: version 0.0.1\nbump2version --new-version 0.0.2\n# AFTER: version 0.0.2\n\n# If the version is already beta, you should just use release.\n# BEFORE: version 0.0.1-beta.4\nbump2version release\n# AFTER: version 0.0.1\n```\n\n\n## Conda\n\nWe use conda as our main \"supported\" way of distributing dependencies.\nYou can find more information in the `conda` directory where we store some of our own recipes to build conda packages.\nPreference packages in `conda-forge` or `bioconda` over packaging something yourself.\nMy hope is to get those packages into `bioconda` when I have some more time.\n\nIf you're developing the pipeline or adding new software, conda is probably the easiest way to run the pipeline because you can modify the environment easily.\nBut to test that everything is working correctly, i'd suggest building the containers and running there.\nThis is because it's easy to get software dependencies leaking in from your own computer, which means that the commands might fail for someone else on a different computer.\nSince containers try to provide the bare minimum, you have greater assurance that the conda environment (and therefore all containers) contains everything needed to run the pipeline.\n\n\n## Docker\n\nDocker is a type of container virtualisation system.\nIt is useful because it gives us a consistent environment on different computers, which means fewer installations and weird headache bugs.\n\nNextflow handles most of what we need to run the pipeline with nextflow, but if you just want to try out some commands that aren't installed on your computer you can run it in the docker container.\n\nThe downside to docker is that it requires root permission to use, and to relieve that requirement is a security issue.\n\n\nAs an example I'll use the existing [bedtools container](https://hub.docker.com/r/biocontainers/bedtools/).\n\n```bash\nsudo docker pull biocontainers/bedtools\nsudo docker run --rm -v \"${PWD}:/data:rw\" -w /data biocontainers/bedtools bedtools intersect -a left.bed -b right.bed\n```\n\nBreaking this apart. We first `pull` the container from dockerhub and `run` a command inside the container.\n`--rm` tells docker that we'd like it to remove the container (not the image) after it has finished running.\n`-v \"${PWD}:/data:rw` tells docker that we'd like to mount our current working directory to `/data` inside the container, and that we'd like it to be read-writable (`rw`).\nWe also set the working directory (`-w`) inside the container to be `/data` (where we mounted the files in our current working directory), so we've replicated our current state.\nIf you don't tell docker to mount your data like this, you won't be able to access your local files.\n\n\nTo view which images you have pulled you can use `sudo docker images`.\n\nTo run commands inside a container interactively, you need to add the `-i -t` flags.\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run --rm -it -v \"${PWD}:/data:rw\" biocontainers/bedtools bash\n```\n\nYou can now interact with the container as if it was your own terminal.\n\n\n## Singularity\n\nSingularity is similar to docker, it's a bit simpler for bioinformatics but isn't as well documented or popular.\n\nIt also doesn't require root permission to use, which makes it much easier to stay safe while developing.\n\nSingularity can run existing docker images, so anything that's available on dockerhub is fine.\nI'll use the same bedtools image.\n\n```bash\n# Pull the most recent version of the image and save it locally in singularitys format to bedtools.sif\nsingularity pull bedtools.sif docker://biocontainers/bedtools:latest\n\nsingularity exec ./bedtools.sif bedtools intersect -a left.bed -b right.bed\n```\n\nThis does the same thing as the docker example, but singularity mounts common paths and your current working directory for you so you don't need to worry as much.\n\n\nYou can also interactively work with singularity containers.\n\n```bash\nsingularity shell ./bedtools.sif\n```\n\nThere is a bit of a catch with singularity.\nBecause the containers are essentially immutable, you can't normally read or write to system directories, which includes some temporary file directories (Technically there is a way, but I haven't really been able to get it working).\nIn practice this means that you can't install software inside a singularity container after it's been built, and for commands that use temporary files you should explicitly set the temporary directory using a flag or the `TMPDIR` environment variable.\n`sort` always catches me out with this.\nIf you get an error about 'read-only' filesystems, this is what that's about.\n"

If you are updating to use a new version of the pipeline, you should also re-build the software environment for the new version.\n\nTo remove old versions of the software environment:\n\n```\n# conda\nconda env remove -n predector\n# or if you installed to a directory\nconda env remove -p /path/to/conda/env\n\n# docker\nOLD_VERSION=1.1.1\ndocker rmi -f predector/predector-base:${OLD_VERSION}\ndocker rmi -f predector/predector:${OLD_VERSION}\n```\n\nSingularity container files can simply be deleted if you like.\nDocker commands may require sudo depending on how your computer is set up.\n\n\n### 1. Install Conda, Docker, or Singularity\n\nWe provide automated ways of installing dependencies using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments (linux OS only), or [docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) or [singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) containers.\n\nPlease follow the instructions at one of the following links to install:\n\n- https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html\n- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n- https://sylabs.io/guides/\n\n> We cannot support conda environments on Mac or Windows.\n> This is because some older software included in SignalP 3 and 4 is not compiled for these operating systems, and being closed source we cannot re-compile them.\n> Even windows WSL2 does not seem to play well with SignalP 4.\n> \n> Please use a full Linux virtual machine (e.g. a cloud server or locally in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)) or one of the containerised options.\n\nIf you are running conda, we can also build the environment using [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\nFunctionally there is no difference between mamba and conda environments, but mamba is faster at building the environment.\nJust install mamba into your base `conda` environment (or install [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) instead of miniconda) and select the `mamba` option later.\n\n> Please note. We **strongly** recommend the containerised environments (docker or singularity) if the option is available to you.\n> The vast majority of issues we've helped people with have been related to poor isolation from the host environment or broken conda dependencies (which we have little control over other than vigilance).\n> Containers sidestep both of these issues.\n> We're more than happy to support conda and help you with any issues, but if you want to avoid issues I suggest using docker or singularity.\n\n\n### 2. Download the proprietary software dependencies\n\nPredector runs several tools that we cannot download for you automatically.\nPlease register for and download each of the following tools, and place them all somewhere that you can access from your terminal.\nWhere you have a choice between versions for different operating systems, you should always take the **Linux** version (even if using Mac or Windows).\n\n- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-3.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 3.0\n- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-4.1/9-Downloads.php#) version 4.1g\n- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-5.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 5.0b\n- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-6.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 6.0g \"fast\" **\\*currently optional**\n- [TargetP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/TargetP-2.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 2.0\n- [DeepLoc](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc-1.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 1.0\n- [TMHMM](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 2.0c\n- [Phobius](http://software.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/request.cgi?project=phobius) version 1.01\n\nNote that DTU (SignalP etc) don't keep older patches and minor versions available.\nIf the specified version isn't available to download, another version with the same major number _should_ be fine.\nBut please also let us know that the change has happened, so that we can update documentation and make sure our installers handle them correctly.\n\nI suggest storing these all in a folder and just copying the whole lot around.\nIf you use Predector often, you'll likely re-build the environment fairly often.\n\n> We've been having some teething problems with SignalP 6. Until this is resolved I've made installing and running it optional.\n> You don't have to install SignalP6, though I recommend you try to.\n\n\n### 3. Build the conda environment or container\n\nWe provide an install script that should install the dependencies for the majority of users.\n\nIn the following command, substitute the assigned value of `ENVIRONMENT` for `conda`, `mamba`, `docker`, or `singularity` as suitable.\nMake sure you're in the same directory as the proprietary source archives.\nIf the names below don't match the filenames you have exactly, adjust the command accordingly.\nFor singularity and docker container building you may be prompted for your root password (via `sudo`).\n\n```bash\nENVIRONMENT=docker\n\ncurl -s \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7/install.sh\" \\\n| bash -s \"${ENVIRONMENT}\" \\\n    -3 signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z \\\n    -4 signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz \\\n    -5 signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz \\\n    -6 signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz \\\n    -t targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz \\\n    -d deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz \\\n    -m tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz \\\n    -p phobius101_linux.tar.gz\n```\n\nThis will create the conda environment (named `predector`), or the docker (tagged `predector/predector:1.2.7`) or singularity (file `./predector.sif`) containers.\n\n**Take note of the message given upon completion**, which will tell you how to use the container or environment with Predector.\n\nIf you don't want to install SignalP 6 you can exclude the `-6 filename.tar.gz` argument.\n\nThe install script has some minor options that allow you to customise how and where things are built.\nYou can also save the install script locally and run `install.sh --help` to find more information.\n\n```\n-n|--name         -- For conda, sets the environment name (default: 'predector').\n                     For docker, sets the image tag (default: 'predector/predector:1.2.7').\n                     For singularity, sets the output image filename (default: './predector.sif').\n-c|--conda-prefix -- If set, use this as the location to store the built conda\n                     environment instead of setting a name and using the default\n                     prefix. This is useful if the location that conda is installed in is restricted somehow,\n                     or if it isn't available as a shared drive if on a cluster.\n--conda-template  -- Use this conda environment.yml file instead of downloading it from github.\n                     Only affects conda installs.\n-v|--version      -- The version of the pipeline that you want to\n                     setup dependencies for. Note that this may not work in\n                     general, and you're recommended to use the install.sh\n                     script for the targeted version.\n```\n\nNote that the `-s` in `bash -s` is a bash flag rather than for our install script.\nIt is only necessary if the script is coming into bash from stdin (as in the `curl -s URL | bash` command), and it tells bash that any [further arguments should go to the script rather than the bash runtime itself](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash).\nIf you are running like `bash ./install.sh ...` you don't need the `-s`.\n\n\n### 4. Install NextFlow\n\nNextFlow requires a bash compatible terminal, and Java version 8+.\nWe require NextFlow version 21 or above.\nExtended install instructions are available at: [https://www.nextflow.io/](https://www.nextflow.io).\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash\n```\n\nOr using conda:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c bioconda nextflow>=21\n```\n\n### 5. Test the pipeline\n\nUse one of the commands below using information given upon completion of dependency install script.\n**Make sure you use the environment that you specified in [Step 3](#3--Build-the-conda-environment-or-container).**\n\nUsing conda:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run -profile test -with-conda /home/username/path/to/environment -resume -r 1.2.7 ccdmb/predector\n```\n\nUsing docker:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run -profile test,docker -resume -r 1.2.7 ccdmb/predector\n\n# if your docker configuration requires sudo use this profile instead\nnextflow run -profile test,docker_sudo -resume -r 1.2.7 ccdmb/predector\n```\n\nUsing singularity:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run -profile test -with-singularity path/to/predector.sif -resume -r 1.2.7 ccdmb/predector\n\n# or if you've build the container using docker and it's in your local docker registry.\nnextflow run -profile test,singularity -resume -r 1.2.7 ccdmb/predector\n```\n\n## Extended dependency install guide\n\nIf the quick install method doesn't work for you, you might need to run the environment build steps manually.\nIt would be great if you could also contact us to report the issue, so that we can get the quick install instructions working for more people.\n\nThe following guides assume that you have successfully followed the steps 1, 2, and 4, and aim to replace step 3.\n\n### Building the conda environment the long way\n\nWe provide a conda environment file that can be downloaded and installed.\nThis environment contains several \"placeholder\" packages to deal with the proprietary software.\nEssentially, these placeholder packages contain scripts to take the source files of the\nproprietary software, and install them into the conda environment for you.\n\n**It is necessary to run both of the code blocks below to properly install the environment.**\n\nFirst we create the conda environment, which includes the non-proprietary dependencies and the \"placeholder\" packages.\n\n```bash\n# Download the environment config file.\ncurl -o environment.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7/environment.yml\n\n# Create the environment\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate predector\n```\n\nTo complete the installation we need to run the `*-register` scripts, which install the proprietary source archives you downloaded yourself.\nYou can copy-paste the entire command below directly into your terminal.\nModify the source tar archive filenames in the commands if necessary.\n\n```bash\nsignalp3-register signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z \\\n&& signalp4-register signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz \\\n&& signalp5-register signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz \\\n&& signalp6-register signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz \\\n&& targetp2-register targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz \\\n&& deeploc-register deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz \\\n&& phobius-register phobius101_linux.tar.gz \\\n&& tmhmm2-register tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz\n```\n\nIf any of the `*-register` scripts fail, please contact the authors or raise an issue on github (we'll try to have an FAQ setup soon).\n\n\n### Building the Docker container the long way\n\nFor docker and anything that supports docker images we have a [prebuilt container on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/predector/predector-base) containing all of the open-source components.\nTo install the proprietary software we use this image as a base to build on with a new dockerfile.\nTo build the new image with the proprietary dependencies, you need to run the command below which can all be copy-pasted directly into your terminal.\nModify the source `.tar` archive filenames in the command if necessary.\nDepending on how you installed docker you may need to use `sudo docker` in place of `docker`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7/Dockerfile \\\n| docker build \\\n  --build-arg SIGNALP3=signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z \\\n  --build-arg SIGNALP4=signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz \\\n  --build-arg SIGNALP5=signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz \\\n  --build-arg SIGNALP6=signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz \\\n  --build-arg TARGETP2=targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz \\\n  --build-arg PHOBIUS=phobius101_linux.tar.gz \\\n  --build-arg TMHMM=tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz \\\n  --build-arg DEEPLOC=deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz \\\n  -t predector/predector:1.2.7 \\\n  -f - \\\n  .\n```\n\nYour container should now be available as `predector/predector:1.2.7` in your docker registry `docker images`.\n\n\n### Building the Singularity container the long way\n\nThere are a few ways to build the singularity image with the proprietary software installed (the filename `predector.sif` in the sections below).\n\nIf you only have singularity installed, you can build the container directly\nby downloading the `.def` file and setting some environment variables with the\npaths to the proprietary source archives.\nThe following commands will build this image for you, and can be copy-pasted directly into your terminal.\nModify the source tar archive filenames if necessary.\n\n```bash\n# This is used to emulate the --build-args functionality of docker.\n# Singularity lacks this feature. You can unset the variables after you're done.\nexport SIGNALP3=signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z\nexport SIGNALP4=signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz\nexport SIGNALP5=signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz\nexport SIGNALP6=signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz\nexport TARGETP2=targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz\nexport PHOBIUS=phobius101_linux.tar.gz\nexport TMHMM=tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz\nexport DEEPLOC=deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz\n\n# Download the .def file\ncurl -o ./singularity.def https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7/singularity.def\n\n# Build the .sif singularity image.\n# Note that `sudo -E` is important, it tells sudo to keep the environment variables\n# that we just set.\nsudo -E singularity build \\\n  predector.sif \\\n  ./singularity.def\n```\n\nIf you've already built the container using docker, you can convert them to singularity format.\nYou don't need to use `sudo` even if your docker installation usually requires it.\n\n```bash\nsingularity build predector.sif docker-daemon://predector/predector:1.2.7\n```\n\n\nBecause the container images are quite large, `singularity build` will sometimes fail if your `/tmp` partition isn't big enough.\nIn that case, set the following environment variables and remove the cache directory (`rm -rf -- \"${PWD}/cache\"`) when `singularity build` is finished.\n\n```bash\nexport SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=\"${PWD}/cache\"\nexport SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=\"${PWD}/cache\"\nexport SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHEDIR=\"${PWD}/cache\"\n```\n\n\n## Copying environments to places where you don't have root user permission\n\nWe can't really just put the final container images up on dockerhub or singularity hub,\nsince that would violate the proprietary license agreements.\nSo if you don't have root user permission on the computer (e.g. a supercomputing cluster) you're going to run the analysis on you can either use the conda environments or build a container on a different computer and copy the image up.\n\n\nIf the option is available to you, I would recommend using the singularity containers for HPC.\nSingularity container `.sif` files can be simply copied to whereever you're running the analysis.\n\n\nSome supercomputing centres will have [`shifter`](https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/shifter/overview/) installed, which allows you to run jobs with docker containers. Note that there are two versions of `shifter` and nextflow only supports one of them (the nersc one).\nDocker containers can be saved as a tarball and copied wherever you like.\n\n```bash\n# You could pipe this through gzip if you wanted.\ndocker save predector/predector:1.2.7 > predector.tar\n```\n\nAnd on the other end\n\n```bash\ndocker load -i predector.tar\n```\n\n\nConda environments should be able to be built anywhere, since they don't require root user permission.\nYou should just be able to follow the instructions described earlier.\nJust make sure that you install the environment on a shared filesystem (i.e. one that all nodes in your cluster can access).\n\nThere are also options for \"packing\" a conda environment into something that you can copy around (e.g. [conda-pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/)), though we haven't tried this yet.\n\n\nHopefully, one of these options will work for you.\n"

        "description": "A DEVELOPMENT RELEASE. Use at your own risk.\r\nThis is for me to test the pipeline in numerous environments so that I can track down the SignalP issue described in #92, and #93.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\nWe've removed Pfamscan as Pfam seems to be undergoing some changes and the old pfamscan script doesn't always work.\r\nI have plans to enable integration of interproscan results shortly.\r\n\r\nFixes a bug causing only a subset of PHI-base searches to be run.\r\n\r\nUpdated the installation and links in documentation for Phobius as the source has moved (thanks to @markusHaferkamp for reporting this).\r\nUpdated installer to use SignalP 6.0h.\r\n\r\nImproved error reporting for SignalP 3 and 4. These programs sometimes fail silently, causing cryptic errors down the road about Dmatrix types in xgboost.\r\nI still haven't been able to reproduce the segfaults observed by some people, so i can't find the cause.\r\nBut this will at least be clearer as to what's going on.\r\n\r\nRelated to signalp3. The Dmatrix datatypes are now explicitly set, so even if SignalP3 doesn't give any results you'll be able to get some ranked outputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ccdmb/predector/compare/1.2.7...1.2.8-alpha",

There are still known issues with 6.0e so I was waiting for the update, but it's probably worth having this now.\r\n- Fixed a bug in decode_seqs that could cause error if only one file goes into it. (in which case it will be symlinked as just the extension, so the file looks like a dotfile and isn't captured by the glob.\r\n- Added support to not install signalp6 in the environment. In this case the pipeline will automatically detect that it isn't installed and skip the analysis.\r\n- Added flags to not do perform the analyses: signalp 6, pfamscan, dbcan searches, effectordb searches, phibase searches.\r\n- Added flag to control the batch size for signalp6 to control memory usage.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ccdmb/predector/compare/1.2.3...1.2.4",
