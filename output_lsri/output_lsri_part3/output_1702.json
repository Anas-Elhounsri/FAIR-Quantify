Then proceed as follows:\n\nAfter cloning Panache's repository, the container can be built and launched running ```bash start.sh``` (with your sudo rights enabled; this will both create a build version and serve it with nginx).\n\n**The web interface will be available after 4-ish minutes once everything is built.** If you are impatient and want to see what is happening live, you can also run the same command that is in ```start.sh``` without the ```-d``` option, which hides the standard output from the generated container.\nAccess the visualization through your [localhost](localhost:8080/) (by default a dev version will be served throught port 8080 and a prod version through port 1337).\n\nThe visualization could be served on a custom IP when specified inside the nginx.conf file, instead of (or alongside with) localhost.\n"
