Please search on both the [*MRtrix3* community forum](http://community.mrtrix.org/search)\n   and the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues)\n   to see if anybody else has lodged a similar observation.\n\n1. How confident are you that the behaviour you have observed is in fact a\n   genuine bug, and not a misunderstanding?\n\n   -  *Confident*: Please [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues/new);\n      select the \"bug report\" issue template to get started.\n\n   -  *Not so confident*: That's fine! Consider instead creating a new topic\n      on the [*MRtrix3* community forum](http://community.mrtrix.org/);\n      others can then comment on your observation and determine the\n      appropriate level of escalation.\n\n## Requesting a new feature\n\nPlease search the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues)\nto see if anybody else has made a comparable request:\n\n   -  If a corresponding issue already exists, please add a comment to that\n      issue to escalate the request. Additionally, describe any\n      aspect of that feature not yet described in the existing issue.\n\n   -  If no such listing exists, then you are welcome to create a [new\n      issue](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues/new) outlining the\n      request. Be sure to select the \"feature request\" option to get started\n      with writing the Issue.\n      \n## Asking questions\n\nGeneral questions regarding *MRtrix3* installation, usage, or any other\naspect that is not specific to the *MRtrix3* *code*, should be directed to\nthe [community forum](http://community.mrtrix.org/). Also consider perusing\nthe [online documentation](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for\nthe software, in case your issue has already been described there.\n\n## Contribution of content\n\nThanks for your interest in making direct contributions to *MRtrix3*!\nWe are excited to expand the breadth of researchers involved in improving\nand expanding this software, and to ensure that all who make such\ncontributions receive appropriate acknowledgement through Git.\n\nThe instructions below give an overview of how to go about generating a\nproposed change to *MRtrix3*. Making your first contribution to an\nopen-source project can certainly be daunting. The *MRtrix3* developers\nare however more than willing to be engaged in the process for those\nwithout experience in Git or GitHub.\n\n#### Classification of contribution\n\nWe here classify three distinct types of contributions. For any particular\nproposed contribution, the classification here will influence the advice\nto be provided in subsequent sections of this document.\n\n1. *Fixing a bug*\n\n   If the current code behaviour is *unambiguously incorrect*.\n\n   If there does not already exist a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues)\n   describing the bug, consider reporting the bug as a standalone Issue\n   prior to progressing further; that way developers can confirm the issue,\n   and possibly provide guidance if you intend to resolve the issue yourself.\n\n2. *Adding or altering features*\n\n   If any of the following are true:\n\n   -  The current code behaviour is considered incorrect or non-ideal,\n      and could be improved, but is nevertheless *functional* in its\n      current state;\n\n   -  The proposed change would *alter* the output data generated by\n      a command;\n\n   -  The proposed change improves the *performance* of a particular\n      command or process, but does not change its output.\n\n   -  The proposal involves a novel addition to the repository that\n      is inconsequential for the operation of any existing command.\n\n3. *Documentation*\n\n   If you wish to make changes to the [*MRtrix3* documentation](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n#### Generating content\n\n1. If you have not already done so, you will need to create a *fork* of\n   the [*MRtrix3* repository](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3)\n   into your GitHub account, where unlike the main *MRtrix3* repository,\n   you will have full write access to make the requisite changes.\n\n1. Create a Git branch that is named appropriately according to the\n   modifications that are being made. The existing code branch on which\n   this new derived branch should be based depends on the nature of the\n   proposed change:\n\n   -  If your changes involve *fixing a bug* in existing *MRtrix3*\n      functionality, then your code should be based on the \"`master`\"\n      branch.\n\n      Once merged, these changes will become immediately available to any user\n      building *MRtrix3* from source via the default `master` branch, whether\n      from freshly cloning that source code or from updating their code. It\n      will additionally be included in the next tag release of *MRtrix3*,\n      including \"*patch*\" releases, i.e. \"`3.0.x`\" (see [this\n      page](https://semver.org/) for a full description of release versioning)\n\n      This can be done with the following commands:\n\n      ```\n      $ git checkout master\n      $ git checkout -b fix_feature\n      ```\n\n      (name your new branch appropriately)\n\n   -  If your changes involve *adding or altering features*, then your\n      code should be based on the \"`dev`\" branch. \n\n      Once merged, such code will only be propagated to users who elect to\n      explicitly check out the code on the \"`dev`\" branch when building *MRtrix3*\n      from source, which will almost exclusively be the core development team.\n      It will additionally be included in the next *minor* release of\n      *MRtrix3*, i.e. \"`3.x.0`\" (*patch* releases, i.e. \"`3.0.x`\", do *not*\n      include changes that have been merged onto the \"`dev`\" branch). (see\n      [this page](https://semver.org/) for a full description of release\n      versioning)\n\n      This can be done with the following commands:\n\n      ```\n      $ git checkout dev\n      $ git checkout -b add_feature\n      ```\n\n      (name your new branch appropriately)\n\n   -  If only making changes to the *MRtrix3* *documentation*, then the\n      appropriate base branch will depend upon the nature of the changes\n      being proposed and the urgency of the update. For instance, if providing\n      a minor correction to spelling / grammar, or fixing an erroneous\n      hyperlink, then a direct merge to `master` is likely appropriate.\n      Conversely, if the changes are non-trivial, and it makes more sense for\n      the changes to be made as part of an *MRtrix3* update rather than\n      immediately, then `dev` may be the more appropriate base branch. If\n      the answer to this question in the context of your proposed changes is\n      unclear to you, then please generate an [Issue](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/issues)\n      to facilitate direct discussion with the *MRtrix3* core development\n      team (ideally before commencing the implementation of changes, as\n      incorrect selection can sometimes be laborious to resolve later).\n\n1. Generate one or more Git commits that apply your proposed changes to\n   the repository.\n\n   Before commencing writing or modifying code, you may wish to read the\n   [coding conventions](#coding-conventions) section at the bottom of this\n   page.\n\n   -  Individual commits should ideally have a clear singular purpose,\n      and not incorporate multiple unrelated changes. If your proposed\n      changes involve multiple disparate components, consider breaking\n      those changes up into individual commits.\n\n      Conversely, if multiple code changes are logically grouped with /\n      linked to one another, these should ideally be integrated into a\n      single commit.\n\n   -  Commits should contain an appropriate message that adequately\n      describes the change encapsulated within.\n\n      If the change demands a longer description, then the commit message\n      should be broken into a synopsis (less than 72 characters, ideally less\n      than 50) and message body, separated by two newline characters (as this\n      enables GitHub to parse them appropriately). Please follow the\n      [suggestions on this page](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) to\n      make your git commit messages as useful as possible.\n\n      For single-line commits, this can be achieved at the command-line using\n      the `git commit -m` option:\n\n      `$ git commit -m 'mrconvert: fix problem in datatype handling'`\n\n   -  Where relevant, commit messages can also contain references to\n      GitHub issues or pull requests (type the \"`#`\" character followed\n      by the issue / PR number), and/or other individual commits (copy\n      and paste the first 8-10 characters of the commit hash). This will\n      result in GitHub automatically generating bi-directional hyperlinks\n      between the various pages, which greatly assists in navigating\n      around related discussions.\n\n   -  If multiple persons have contributed to the proposed changes, it is\n      possible to modify individual Git commits to have [multiple\n      authors](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors),\n      to ensure that all contributors receive appropriate acknowledgement.\n\n   As a general rule: Git commits and commit messages should be constructed\n   in such a way that, at some time in the future, when one is navigating\n   through the contribution history, the evolution of the code is as clear\n   as possible.\n\n1. Check that your modified code does not prevent *MRtrix3* from\n   passing existing tests, or introduce any other issues (unless otherwise\n   specified, all files referenced below are in the *MRtrix3* root directory):\n\n   -  If adding or modifying C++ code, make sure that script \"`./check_syntax`\"\n      executes successfully.\n\n   -  If adding or modifying Python code, make sure that script\n      \"`./run_pylint`\" executes successfully.\n\n   -  If there is a chance of your modifications altering the observable\n      behaviour of one or more existing commands, make sure that script\n      \"`./run_tests`\" executes successfully. When running this script you\n      must specify the test(s) to be run: you can either specify an\n      individual command or unit test, or execute tests for all\n      \"`binaries`\" or all \"`scripts`\" (especially important if modifying\n      code that is not specific to an individual command, or modifying\n      a command that is utilised by Python scripts).\n\n   -  If your changes involve the addition of one or more novel commands,\n      or the modification of help page information of an existing command,\n      then you will need to run script \"`./docs/generate_user_docs.sh`\"\n      and generate a commit that adds the resulting updates to the\n      list of available commands and command documentation page(s).\n\n   -  If making changes to the online documentation, then you should ideally\n      generate the documentation on your local system, and manually inspect\n      it for any formatting issues. Instructions for doing so can be found\n      in \"[`docs/README.md`](https://github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3/blob/master/docs/README.md)\".\n\n1. For code contributions, if possible, a unit test or reproducibility\n   test should be added. This can be used to:\n\n   -  Demonstrate appropriate behaviour of novel functionality;\n\n   -  Prove that a demonstrable error with existing code is resolved\n      with the revised code (i.e. *fixing a bug*);\n\n   -  Preclude regression of the behaviour of that code in the future\n      (which can in some instances occur with changes to seemingly\n      unrelated code).\n\n   For tests that require the addition of raw data to the\n   [`test_data`](https://github.com/MRtrix3/test_data) or\n   [`script_test_data`](https://github.com/MRtrix3/script_test_data)\n   repositories, please coordinate with the *MRtrix3* core development\n   team.\n\n#### Creating a Pull Request\n\nOnce you are content with the additions / modifications that you have made\nto the repository content, the next step is to propose that those changes be\nmerged into the main *MRtrix3* repository. This involves setting up a\n\"Pull Request\", which proposes merging the changes that you have made in your\nrepository fork into the relevant branch of the main *MRtrix3* repository.\nIt additionally enables both discussion with the core development team\nregarding those changes, and explicit code review.\n\nThe \"*head*\" branch of the Pull Request should be the Git branch on your\nfork of the repository within which you have performed the relevant changes.\nThe \"*base*\" *repository* should be the main *MRtrix3* repository; however,\nthe base *branch* will depend on the nature of the contribution:\n\n-  If *fixing a bug*, then the base branch should be \"`master`\"\n   (just as was used when first constructing the branch in your fork).\n\n-  If *adding or altering features*, then the base branch should be\n   \"`dev`\" (just as was used when first constructing the branch in your\n   fork).\n\n-  If making changes to the *MRtrix3* *documentation*, then the base\n   branch should be the same branch as was used when first constructing\n   the working branch on your fork.\n\nIn the initial post of your Pull Request, you should include in your text\nreferences to any other Issues or Pull Requests that you consider relevant\nto the discussion, as this greatly facilitates reader comprehension (and\nthis may indeed include yourself in the future). Simply including the text\n\"`#xxxx`\" (replacing \"`xxxx`\" with the number of the relevant Issue /\nPull Request) will result in GitHub automatically creating bi-directional\nhyperinks between the relevant pages.\n\n-----\n\n## Coding conventions\n\nWhile we do not have strict enforced coding conventions in *MRtrix3*, the\naccepted conventions should be self-evident from the code itself. So while\nsome flexibility in coding style is permitted, substantial deviations\nfrom such may result in a request during the Pull Request phase to make\ncorresponding revisions.\n\nA few explicit notes on such:\n\n-  For both C++ and Python, indentation is achieved using two space\n   characters.\n\n-  Newline characters are Unix-style (\"`LF`\" / '`\\n`'); any changes that\n   introduce Windows-style newline characters (\"`CR LF`\" / \"`\\r\\n`\")\n   will need to be edited accordingly.\n\n-  In Python, variable / class / module names are enforced through\n   `pylint`. Script \"`run_pylint`\" in the *MRtrix3* root directory\n   will test any code modifications against these expectations.\n\n-  If the operation of your code is not trivially self-apparent,\n   please endeavour to comment appropriately.\n\n-  Do not leave excess newline characters at the end of a file.\n"
