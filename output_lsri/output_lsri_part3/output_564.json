This was created using [`pyinstaller`](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/), and just bundles together all the required packages. It must be run from within the Scripts directory, as with the regular scripts. While it's been tested on several machines, this is not as actively maintained as the core scripts, and is included here for users who don't wish to engage with the command line even a little.",
