Then, a MATLAB figure opens up waiting for a click on the first pixel of the opted boundary. After clicking on the initial pixel of the desired path, as the user moves the mouse along the path, the smallest cost path based on the brightness of pixels is displayed.He should drag the mouse on the path so as to discover a route which best fits that path and click on whenever he observes that the route has become inappropriate. This process proceeds until the entire path is acquired. The user should press the enter key at this time to close the figure. To facilitate moving between boundaries by the user, we have made colored lamps demonstrating the state of each boundary. The green color indicates that the boundary is acquired completely and the red color is the sign of not yet acquired boundaries.\n\nIn the Manual-Grid tab, the user chooses the to-be-segmented boundary and enters the number of adequate vertical lines by which that boundary should be gridded. After that, a gridded B-Scan opens up in a figure asking the user to click the boundary exactly on the plotted vertical lines. When finished, the interpolated boundary is depicted.\n\nIn the Correction tabs, the user can correct the defective boundaries in each method. The user should first click on the beginning and end of the intended path for correction. This path is omitted and gridded by vertical lines the number of which should be set by the \u201cGrid\u201d textbox. The following steps is exactly like the Manual-Grid layer segmentation. When finished, the corrected boundary is replaced.\n\n\"voldata.vol\" is a proper data sample with a \".vol\" format for a real test.\n"
