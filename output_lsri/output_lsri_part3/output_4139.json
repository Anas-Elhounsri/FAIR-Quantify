When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via [Issues](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d/issues), email (xiaoyu.liang@yale.edu), or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. \n\n## Report a bug\n\nBefore reporting a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d/issues). \n\n* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Windows 10 10.0, Mac OS 10.15.6).\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\n\n## Propose an idea \n\nHave an idea for a new i2d feature? Take a look at the [package main page](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d) and [issues](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d/issues) to see if it is included or suggested. If not yet, suggest your idea as an [issue on i2d](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d/issues). While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n* Give an example of possible.\n\n## Improve the package documentation\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code. If you want to improve a function description or make any change of the function, we recommend you to upload a new function with a new name. \n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d/tree/master/R/).\n2. [Upload the function documentation](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d/tree/master/R/).\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/XiaoyuLiang/i2d) and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.\n3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n    * Write and test your code.\n    * Document your code.\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).\n"
