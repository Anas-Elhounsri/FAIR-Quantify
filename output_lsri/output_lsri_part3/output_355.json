MS-Decipher also provides useful tools for the visualization of PSMs in the result and the generation of the scorer files. \nMS-Decipher is written in the cross-platform Java programming language, with a GUI written in JavaFX. It has been packaged as an application, and put in a folder with other necessary configuration files and a java runtime environment (jre 11). Instructions on software installation and operation, common problems and other issues could be found in the documentations. \n \n"

In this strategy, theoretical O-glycan Y-ion patterns are constructed to match the experimental Y-ions in O-glycopeptide spectra, which enables the determination of the mass of some glycans and results.\r\nThis search mode, the O-Search-pattern, has been implemented into our database search software, MS-Decipher, and is recommended for the searching of O-glycopeptide spectra acquired by sceHCD (stepped collision energy higher-energy collisional dissociation).\r\n\r\nArticle: [O\u2011Search-Pattern: A Searching Tool Utilizing the Y\u2011Ion Pattern to Enhance O\u2011Glycopeptide Identification for the Analysis of O\u2011GalNAc Glycoproteome](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c00012)\r\n\r\n",

By clicking on the icons at the right side and below of \u2018Parameter File\u2019, parameter files and MS Data files could be added. Then after selecting the maximum threads allocating to the software from the text field in the bottom of the panel, the search task will be started by clicking on the \u2018start\u2019 button, which is labeled in green arrows.\n\n* Report Search Results\n  <br>\nValidated results could be generated from the second panel. Paths of raw result files and output file can be selected through the buttons at the top left and bottom of the panel. Thresholds and other options, including whether to use percolator, FDR, score threshold, etc., could be modified on the right side. The report task is started similarly as the previous panel.\n\n* Edit Parameters\n  <br>\nParameter files could be created, modified and saved in the third panel. Users is able to set plenty of parameters here. The detailed description of params are listed in the instruction file in each release.\n\n* View PSMs in Results\n  <br>\nWe provide tools for viewing the results obtained from MS-Decipher. By choosing the \u2018PSM Viewer\u2019 in the \u2018Toolbox\u2019 panel, an additional window will pop up. Result files, together with corresponding MS data files can be selected from the \u2018File\u2019 option. Then special result of PSM and the matched ions will be shown in the spectrum. Species, charges of ions, colors and other settings could be modified through \u2018Settings\u2019 in \u2018Edit\u2019 option.\n\n* Generate Scorer File for Rank Score\n  <br>\nSince MS-Decipher adopts the rank score algorithm, which utilizes special scorer files to calculate scores for each match, we provide a scorer generator in the last panel. Result file and its corresponding parameter file and data file could be selected, and the generating task starts by clicking the start button.\n\n* View Task Progress\n  <br>\nThe task progress is displayed in the task progress view at the bottom of each panel in real time (except for the parameter editor).\n\n* Scoring Protocol\n  <br>\n  It\u2019s important to note that the \u2018Protocol\u2019 option is used to select the scoring file for the Rank Score algorithm. For detailed information, please see the articles related to RankScore algorithm: (Kim et al., 2008; Kim and Pevzner, 2014). In short, the scoring step is proceeded based on the scoring file. \n"
