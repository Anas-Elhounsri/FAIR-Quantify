While we push a new version to CRAN, please feel free to use the development version from GitHub. Apologies for the inconvenience. \n* In version 2.3.0, we updated the `rapidopgs_multi()` and `gwascat.download()` functions. For  `rapidopgs_multi()`, we udpated it to accomodate changes on [susieR](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR). Now sample size is required for all files, and the `pi_i` argument has been deprecated. We also opened the possibility to apply R\u00e1pidoPGS to non-European ancestries. For `gwascat.download()`, we updated the method, which wasn't working anymore to extract data from GWAS catalog. It now works interactively, providing the users advice on which file to choose. We also updated the hg38 LD blocks file, as it was updated in its original repository.\n* In version 2.2.0, we updated hg38 LD blocks from liftovered Berisa & Pickrell to recomputed MacDonald et al. 2022 (https://github.com/jmacdon/LDblocks_GRCh38, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.04.483057v1).\n* In development version 2.1.0.9009 we fixed a bug derived from automatically supplying \"nref\" to SuSIE in `rapidopgs_multi()`, which is no longer required.\n* In development version 2.1.0.9008 we fixed a change in the hard-coded url to download 1000G panel from the official server to meet a change in versioning (v5a -> v5b) at the source.\n* In development version 2.1.0.9007 we fixed a bug caused by changes in behavior of `runsusie()` in `rapidopgs_multi()` that used to supply an extra zero element which is not supplied anymore.\n* In development version 2.1.0.9006 we fixed an error popping up when `rapidopgs_multi()` is not supplied input of data.table class, and removed a deprecated argument in `runsusie()` internal function that was preventing `rapidopgs_multi()` to run properly.\n* In development version 2.1.0.9005 we fixed a change in the hard-coded url to download 1000G panel from the official server to meet a change in versioning for sex chromosomes at the source.\n* In version 2.1.0 we added a functionality to `rapidopgs_multi()`, which now allows users to use their own LD matrices instead of computing them on the go from a reference panel. For European datasets, we recommend downloading UK Biobank LD matrices kindly provided by Priv\u00e9 et al., which can be accessed [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/European_LD_reference/13034123). \n"

This involved adding some arguments (N, sample size), and removing others (pi_i, prior probability, now automatically computed by SuSiE). We also now allow the user to supply their own LD block file for non-European GWAS.\n- Fixed `gwascat.download()` to accommodate the new GWAS catalog file structure. Now it is more interactive, providing extra flexibility.\n- Updated vignettes.\n- Updated hg38 LD blocks file from its original repository, which was also updated.\n",
