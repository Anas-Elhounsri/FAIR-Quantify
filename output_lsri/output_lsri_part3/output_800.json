        "value": "The GAI model has two major components. The first is a seasonal flight path model, which describes the seasonal variation in observed counts of individuals throughout a survey season. This is referred to as `a_choice` by the rGAI package, in reference to the use of the letter 'a' to denote this aspect of the model in its 2016 introductory paper (linked above). The options are the use of normal mixtures, a stopover model, or the use of splines. The second major component is the distribution of counts themselves. Either poisson, negative binomial, or zero-inflated poisson distributions can be selected. This aspect of the model is referred to as `dist_choice` by the rGAI package. The below set of simple examples are designed to illustrate using the `fit_GAI` function, to fit GAI models to your own data, as well as how to plot these outputs. Far more detail is available in the package vignette, including the use of covariates, and bootstraps, to produce confidence intervals on quantities of interest.\n\n```\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"calliste-fagard-jenkin/rGAI\", quiet = F)\n\n# The rGAI package comes with an example data set, which we will use to illustrate basic functionality:\nlibrary(rGAI)\ndata(example_data)\ndata(example_par)\n\n# Defining a_choice settings for mixture and stopover models. B refers to the number of broods\n# in the model (i.e. the number of components in the mixture). shared_sigma = TRUE assumed \n# all mixture components have the same variance:\nmy_options <- list(B = 3, shared_sigma = T)\n\n# Now, fitting the model:\nmy_mixture_GAI <- fit_GAI(start = example_par,\n                          DF = example_data, a_choice = \"mixture\",\n                          dist_choice = \"ZIP\", options = my_options,\n                          verbose = T, hessian = T)\n\n# Print the MLEs to show the model has fitted correctly:\nmy_mixture_GAI$par\n\n# We can plot the fitted model using R's inbuilt plot function.
