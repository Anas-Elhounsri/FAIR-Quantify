Unfortunately, mapping data to such a terminology is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge of both the dataset and the terminology. A viable alternative can be the reuse of codebooks - published dataset definitions which, in some cases, have already been mapped to a terminology. We designed the iCRF Generator, a tool which makes it easy to generate interoperable Case Report Forms (iCRFs) for several major EDCs, including Castor and REDCap. The tool currently provides access to multiple codebooks stored online in ART-DECOR and OpenEHR, such as: \n* The Basic Health Data Set (Basisgegevensset Zorg), which is the national standard hospitals will use to exchange electronic healthcare record data\n* RIVM\u2019s population screening colorectal cancer and cervical cancer\n* The pathology Colon biopsy and Colonrectum carcinoma protocols from PALGA, the Dutch national pathology registry.  \nBy using the definitions from such codebooks, a user ensures interoperability with all datasets using these definitions, thus increasing the FAIRness of the data.  \n***Learn more about the iCRF Generator in the [publication](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-81). If you use the iCRF Generator for your project, please cite the paper!***\n \n"

In the original version, when you selected languages, you were given the codebooks in these languages. In the new version, you select a main language and alternative languages. You are presented the codebook in the main language and the CRFs are also generated in the alternative languages using these same items.\n  * Improved selection of codebooks. You can now search for codebooks based on multiple search parameters\n* Easier to customise some aspects (see the Customising the iCRF Generator section):\n  * Originally, the iCRF Generator had a codebooks.txt where you could add codebooks. This has been moved to an Excel file, iCRFSettings.xlsx\n  * Additionally, this file contains languages and validation messages for some languages. You may want to add validation messages for your particular language here, since it currently contains only Dutch and English.\n    * Note: these messages are currently used by ODM-XML and Castor. We aim to add them to other EDCs as well when appropriate.\n* Updated the OpenClinica 3 functionality, which was outdated compared to the other EDCs.\n* Added LibreClinica to the list of EDCs - this uses the OpenClinica 3 functionality. \nNew in 1.2.6:\n* ART-DECOR made some changes which breaks the download of codebooks; instead of http, https has to be used. The file containing the default codebooks is updated with this change. If you don't feel like grabbing the new distribution, you can also just update the codebooks.txt file in the cache directory - change any http to https and you should be fine.  \nNew in 1.2.4 / 1.2.5:\n* Log4j updated to newest version for security reasons \nNew in 1.2.3:\n* Updated to new Apache POI library to fix an issue an OpenClinica CRF and EMX model refused to show the save dialog\n* New RIB logo\n* Cosmetic change to the hyperlink layout on page 3 of the wizard \nNew in 1.2:\n* **Fix for the Mac Catalina gatekeeper issue** See the Running the program chapter below for updated Mac instructions. Let us know if it doesn't work!\n* Support for EMX model output, allowing you to use the iCRF Generator for e.g. Molgenis Catalogue\n* Updated the codelist selection panel, which had some performance issues\n* Added new codebooks, such as the 2020 ZIBs\n* Added a customisable timeout in the Settings. Default is 2 minutes, but there may still be a timeout, as ART-DECOR can be very slow (they're working on it...). After the first time it will of course be cached locally.  \n* Added a small hyperlink \"i\" next to all the codebooks on page 1, which links to the codebook's ART-DECOR page \n"

Molgenis team are creating a 2.0 version of their model, which is not included here yet.\n* ODM-XML: generated files validate. Depending on where you want to use the file, specific ODM-extensions may be necessary\n  \nAdditional EDCs may be added at some point if there is sufficient demand and I know the import definitions (Alea, OC4, Research Manager, etc).\n \n"

        "description": "The NWO-Funded 2.0 version of the iCRF Generator includes many new features and improvements:\r\n* Support for OpenEHR - Specifically, we've added codebooks from ckm.openehr.org\r\n* Support for CDISC's ODM-XML\r\n* Improvements to the User Interface:\r\n  * Change in the iCRF Generator's flow. In the original version, when you selected languages, you were given the codebooks in these languages. In the new version, you select a main language and alternative languages. You are presented the codebook in the main language and the CRFs are also generated in the alternative languages using these same items.\r\n  * Improved selection of codebooks. You can now search for codebooks based on multiple search parameters\r\n* Easier to customise some aspects (see the Customising the iCRF Generator section):\r\n  * Originally, the iCRF Generator had a codebooks.txt where you could add codebooks. This has been moved to an Excel file, iCRFSettings.xlsx\r\n  * Additionally, this file contains languages and validation messages for some languages. You may want to add validation messages for your particular language here, since it currently contains only Dutch and English.\r\n    * Note: these messages are currently used by ODM-XML and Castor. We aim to add them to other EDCs as well when appropriate.\r\n* Updated the OpenClinica 3 functionality, which was outdated compared to the other EDCs.\r\n* Added LibreClinica to the list of EDCs - this uses the OpenClinica 3 functionality.",
