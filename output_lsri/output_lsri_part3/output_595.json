To determine the P-site within ribosome footprints at nucleotide resolution, the precise estimation of its offset with respect to the protected fragment is necessary.  \n __riboWaltz__ is an R package for calculation of optimal P-site offsets, diagnostic analysis and visual inspection of ribosome profiling data. Taking advantage of a two-step algorithm where offset information is passed through populations of reads with different length in order to maximize offset coherence, __riboWaltz__ computes with high precision the P-site offset. __riboWaltz__ also provides a variety of graphical representations, laying the foundations for further accurate RiboSeq analyses and improved interpretation of positional information. \n"

BAM based on transcript coordinates can be generated alinging the reads i) directly against transcript sequences or ii) against standard chromosome sequences and forcing the outputs to be translated in transcript coordinates. \n The first option can be easily handled by many aligners (e.g. Bowtie), given a reference FASTA file where each sequence represents a transcript, from the beginning of the 5' UTR to the end of the 3' UTR.

However, it is possible to assign new names to the samples during their acquisition thanks to the *name_samples* parameter.

The PO is defined as the distance between the extremities of a read and the first nucleotide of the P-site itself. `psite` processes all samples separately starting from reads mapping on the reference codon (either the start codon or the second to last codon, specified by *start*) of any annotated coding sequences. Read lengths-specific POs are inferred in two steps. First, reads mapping on the reference codon are grouped according to their length, each group corresponding to a bin. Reads whose extremities are too close to the reference codon are discarded (see the *flanking* parameter). For each bin temporary 5' and 3' POs are defined as the distances between the first nucleotide of the reference codon and the nucleotide corresponding to the global maximum found in the profiles of the 5' and the 3' end at the left and at the right of the reference codon, respectively. After the identification of the P-site for all reads aligning on the reference codon, the POs corresponding to each length are assigned to each read of the dataset. Second, the most frequent temporary POs associated with the optimal extremity (see the *extremity* parameter) and the predominant bins are exploited as reference values for correcting the temporary POs of smaller bins. Briefly, the correction step defines for each length bin a new PO based on the local maximum, whose distance from the reference codon is the closest to the most frequent temporary POs. For further details please refer to the __riboWaltz__ article, available [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006169).\n \n For each sample `psite` prints on the screen the extremity chosen for the computation of the P-site offsets and the value upon which the correction is based. The offsets computed by `psite` are stored in a data table. Note: a non-filtered list of data tables is used as input in the following examples.

The regions around the reference codon defined by the *flanking* parameter are shaded. \n    reads_psite_list <- psite_info(reads_list, psite_offset)\n\t\n `psite_info` attaches to each data table four columns reporting i) the P-site position with respect to the 1st nucleotide of the transcript, ii) the P-site position with respect to the start and the stop codon of the annotated coding sequence (if any) and iii) the region of the transcript (5' UTR, CDS, 3' UTR) that includes the P-site. Please note: for transcripts not associated with any annotated CDS the position of the P-site with respect to the start and the stop codon is set to NA.

        "description": "Updates related to the Version 2.0. of **riboWaltz**:\r\n\r\n- major upgrades for all functions generating graphical outputs. The many features shared across these functions ensure a consistent syntax and the same structure of the outputs. The following parameters are now included in all functions:\r\n  - _sample_ and _multisamples_ to specify how to handle one or multiple samples along with replicates (if any). _sample_ is no more optional and must be always specified.\r\n  - _plot_style_ to define the number of plots returned and their arrangement. This parameter offers different graphical options tailored to the specific function being considered.\r\n  - _transcripts_, _length_range_ and _cl_ to restrict the analysis and visualization to subpopulations of transcripts and/or reads.\r\n- the outputs associated with the previous functions share the same structure and include the ggplot object(s), the raw data for each sample/replicate and the data obtained by averaging the replicates (if any) and reported in the plot.\r\n- _contrast_sample_ introduced in *codon_usage_psite*.\r\n- _scale_factors_ introduced in *rlength_distr*, *rends_heat*, *metaprofile_psite* and *metaheatmap_psite*.\r\n- _plot_title_ removed from *metaprofile_psite* and *metaheatmap_psite*.\r\n- _label_sample_ removed from *region_psite*.\r\n- all functions can take grangeslit objects as input.\r\n- *psite_info* now checks the P-site positioning with respect to the read extremities. If the P-site is too close to one end of the corresponding read (<4 nts i.e., no space is left for the A-site or the E-site), that read and all of the same length are discarded.\r\n - _granges_  was replaced with _output_class_ for funtions *length_filter*, *duplicates_filter*, *psite_info*, *bamtolist* and *bedtolist* and requires no more a logical value but a character string.\r\n- several bugs fixed.\r\n- documentation updates.\r\n\r\nThank @heylf for his effort in making **riboWaltz** available through Conda.",

Whith the default parameters, `codon_usage_psite` returns one or multiple bar plots of the resulting codon usage indexes, highlighting the start and stop codons and labelling each bar with the corresponding triplet and amino acid.

Note that when *frequency_normalization=TRUE* the low frequency of the three stop codons often leads to codon usage indexes higher for these triplets than for the others. To avoid potential biases in the interpretation of the data we can discard the stop codons from the plot by *include_stop_codons=FALSE*, as shown in the following example: \n  \n\t\tinput_samples <- list(\"S1\" = c(\"Samp1\", \"Samp2\"))\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\texample_cu_barplot <- codon_usage_psite(reads_psite_list, mm81cdna,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t sample = input_samples,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t multisamples = \"average\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t plot_style = \"facet\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t fastapath = \"path/to/transcriptome/FASTA/file\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t fasta_genome = FALSE,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t frequency_normalization = TRUE,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t include_stop_codons = FALSE) \n\t\texample_cu_barplot[[\"plot_S1\"]]\n\t![example_cu_barplot](https://github.com/LabTranslationalArchitectomics/riboWaltz/blob/master/vignettes/example_cu_barplot3.png)  \n  \n \n`codon_usage_psite` can be exploited for investigating alterations of ribosome translocation at specific codons by comparing empirical codon usage from multiple samples or multiple populations of reads (e.g. with different length). The parameter *contrast_sample* specifies the sample(s) (if any) to be considered when comparing the codon usage indexes between:\n * two samples in *sample*;\n * one sample and 64 triplet-specific values provided by the user (see parameter *codon_values*).\n\nWhen *contrast_sample* is specified and sets of codon usage indexes are compared, `codon_usage_psite` automatically generates a scatter plot where each dot represents a codon, optionally labelled with the corresponding triplet or amino acid. The plot includes the regression line based on the coordinates of the dots and the Pearson correlation coefficient. In both cases a specified number of dots can be labeled by the the corresponding triplet or amino acid symbol (see parameters *label_scatter*, *label_number* and *label_aminoacid*). Using the usual list of samples\n\n\tinput_samples <- list(\"S1\" = c(\"Samp1\", \"Samp2\"),\n\t\t\t      \"S2\" = c(\"Samp3\", \"Samp4\", \"Samp5\"))\n\nwe first investigate if, and to which extent, the normalized codon usage indexes of sample S1 differs from the normalized codon usage indexes of sample S2.\n\n\texample_cu_barplot <- codon_usage_psite(reads_psite_list, mm81cdna,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsample = input_samples,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrast_sample = c(\"S1\", \"S2\"),\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfastapath = \"path/to/transcriptome/FASTA/file\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfasta_genome = FALSE,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrequency_normalization = FALSE) \n\texample_cu_barplot[[\"plot\"]]\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/LabTranslationalArchitectomics/riboWaltz/blob/master/vignettes/example_cu_scatterplot1.png\" width=\"350\" />\n</p>\t\n\nWe then compare the empirical codon indexes associated with sample S1, not normalized, with the mouse codon usage bias values (downloaded from http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon, based on the frequency of synonymous codons in coding DNA regions). The structure of the required data table passed to *codon_values* (here named \"cub_mouse\") is as follows:\n  \n|  codon  |  value  |\n|:------:|:------:|\n|  UUU  |  17.2  |\n|  UCU  |  16.2  |\n|  UAU  |  12.2  |\n|  UGU  |  11.4  |\n|  UUC  |  21.8  |\n|  UCC  |  18.1  |\n|  ...  |  ....  |\n  \nHere the resulting plot:\n  \n\texample_cu_barplot <- codon_usage_psite(reads_psite_list, mm81cdna,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsample = input_samples,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontrast_sample = \"S1\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcodon_values = cub_mouse,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfastapath = \"path/to/transcriptome/FASTA/file\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfasta_genome = FALSE,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrequency_normalization = FALSE,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel_scatter = TRUE, label_number = 5) \n\texample_cu_barplot[[\"plot\"]]\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/LabTranslationalArchitectomics/riboWaltz/blob/master/vignettes/example_cu_scatterplot2.png\" width=\"350\" />\n</p>  \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
