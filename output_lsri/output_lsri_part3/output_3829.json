Using `sccoda.util.comp_ana.CompositionalAnalysis(..., reference_cell_type=\"automatic\")` selects a suitable reference cell type.

See #19\r\n\r\n**Enhancements**\r\n- Streamlined the models in `sccoda.model.other_models` to use the same functions\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\n- Fixed a bug when importing the ancom model from skbio\r\n\r\n**Documentation and tutorials**\r\n- Added a tutorial on how to use `sccoda.model.other_models`\r\n- Added a tutorial section for `sccoda.util.data_visualization.rel_abundance_dispersion_plot`\r\n- Added an advanced tutorial section on selecting credibly changing cell types via cycling over all possible references",
