Searchlight2 automates this step, allowing your project to proceed rapidly and with minimum fuss. It accepts standard bulk, GEOmx and psuedo-bulk RNA-seq inputs, and produces a wide range of outputs. Searchlight2 uses a pre-built workflow system, allowing it to deeply explore data from any experimental design or organism. Its range of outputs include:\n1. Plots and analysis, such as volcano, MA, PCA, heatmaps, top gene bopxplots, pathway analysis, upstream regulator analysis, overlap analysis, expression density, fold-vs-fold, signature analysis, and more.\n2. Results presented as publication quality png and svg files, collated into reports. Which include ready-made methods and legends. \n3. Statistical analysis data files and lists of significant, signature or enriched genes and pathways\n4. R scripts for all plots.\n5. An R Shiny app, making it easy for wet-lab scientists to modify each plot visually.\n6. An R-snippet database allowing users change the default appearance of plots. \n\nSearchlight2 is 100% automated, and executed as a single command. It has been designed by project bioinformaticians, and is highly sympathetic to the needs of wet-lab scientists and bioinformatic service providers. It can complete analysis projects in minutes, so you can focus on interpretation.\n\n<br>\n"

Firstly, it validates the input files and combines them into a single \u201cmaster gene table\u201d, from which the downstream analysis is based. Next, it iterates through each workflow, generating: intermediate files; statistical analysis result files; per plot and per workflow R scripts, plots; a report in HMTL; and finally a Shiny app. \n"

Setting up the input files is the most fiddly step first time round, but only takes a few minutes to do. **All input files for Searchlight2 must be tab delimited.** \n* Expression Matrix (EM). Any standard matrix of expression values (TPM, RPKM, Rlog, etc). With genes by row and samples by column. The first column should be the gene ID (Ensembl, Refseq, etc). There must be a header row, and the first header must be \"ID\". Not case-sensitive, ignoring the quotes. The remaining headers should be the sample names. Sample names can't start with a number and can only include numbers, letters and underscore (_). [Here is an example EM file.](https://github.com/Searchlight2/Searchlight2/blob/master/sample_datasets/EM.tsv) \n* Differential expression table(s) (DE). Any standard differential expression table (DESeq2, EdgeR, etc). With the genes by row and the columns trimmed down to include only: gene ID, log2 fold change, p-value and adjusted p-value (in this order). There must be a header row with the headers as exactly: \"ID\", \"Log2Fold\", \"P\", \"P.Adj\". Not case sensitive, ignoring the quotes. The ID type must be the same as the expression matrix. I.e. you can't use ensembl IDs for the expression matrix and Refseq for the differential expression tables. Please supply one differential expression table per comparison. [Here is an example DE file.](https://github.com/Searchlight2/Searchlight2/blob/master/sample_datasets/WT_vs_KO.tsv) \n* Sample sheet (SS). A standard tab delimited sample sheet listing each sample by name in the first column and the sample group it belongs to in the second. There must be a header row with the headers as exactly: \"sample\", \"sample_group\". Not case-sensitive, ignoring the quotes. If you have several layers of sample groupings (such as cell type and also treatment and also age) you may include additional coulmns, under any header that you wish.

A typical background annotation file for the organism and transcriptome build, listing all genes. We supply several of these with the software and they can easily be generated from Ensembls biomart. Genes should be in rows and specific annotation by column. The file must only have the annotations: Gene ID, Gene Symbol, Chromosome, Start position, Stop position and Biotype (type of gene). There must be a header row with the headers as exactly: \"ID\", \"Symbol\", \"Chromosome\", \"Start\", \"Stop\", \"Biotype\". Not case-sensitive, ignoring the quotes. If you are unsure as to the gene symbol, just use the ID. If you are unsure at to the biotype simply put \"gene\" in every cell for that column. Please be aware, for every unique biotype (e.g. coding_gene, linc_RNA, etc) you enter Searchlight2 will perform and entire additional analysis (as well as a single combined), which can be slow. For that reason **we recommend to have all biotypes set as \"gene\" in you BG file**, for your first few runs.

        "value": "So far, we have considered the sitation where we have several independant pairwise comparisons, which we have treated seperately (e.g. WT vs KO and KO vs KO_rescue). However, often it is desirable to ask how several groups of samples compare to each other in more a combinatorial or whole experiment sense. For example: what changes between WT and KO or what changes between KO and KO + rescue is interesting, but it does not tell us the extent to which the rescue returns the KO phenotype to WT. For this we would need to expore all three groups together. This can be achieved using the multiple differential expression (MDE) workflow, which is included via the --mde parameter. The --mde parameter has the following format: \nThe first sub-parameter is straightforward. --name= is simply a name for the workflow output folder. This as usual cannot start with a number and must include only letters, numbers and underscore (\\_). The second sub-parameter takes a moment to consider. The --mde parameter allows two or more differential comparisons to be compared to each other simultaneously. This second sub-parameter tells Searchlight2 exactly which differential comparisons to include in the MDE. It does so by listing the specific numerator=,denominator= combination of each DE to be included. This DE must also be included in a valid --de parameter. For the sample dataset the broken down command might look like this: \nIt is clear to see that to set-up the --mde all that we really needed to do was copy \"numerator=,denominator=\" from each --de parameters and substitute the , for a \\*. This is Searchlight2s' way of understanding that we wish to include these two DE comparisons in a MDE. In this example Searchlight2 will use both sets of differential data and all WT, KO and KO_rescue samples to generate and explore signatures. It will additionally provide summaries and a formal overlap analysis between the two differential comparisons. \nSome examples of the types of plots expected are shown below.  \n**It is very important to note** that there is no upper limit to either the number of DE's that can be included in a single MDE or the number of different MDE workflows that can be included in a single run of Searchlight2. Each different combination will ask a slightly different set of questions of the data. Our previous example (WT, KO, KO_rescue) included only two DE's and so there was only one possible combination of MDE. However, let us now consider a more complicated example. In a dataset with WT, KO and KO_rescue in two different tissues - skin and tendon we will have six groups of samples. We could have between 4 and 9 pertinent comparisons depending on the questions we wish to ask. Our broken down command might look like this: \nThis is obviously starting to appear unweildy. However, it is worth noting that this complexity originates with the experimental design. In fact, Searchlight2 helps to simplify this by formally breaking the analysis down into useful components. That all of these reports will be generated does not mean that the user will wish to look them immediatley. They are readily available should the disucssion move in that direction. If we look at the --mde parameters we can see that many different, but speific research questions are being asked at once. Such as does rescue reverse the KO in skin or in tendon (skin_rescue_effect, tendon_rescue_effect). Does the KO influence the same genes in skin as it does tendon (KO_comparison). Is the rescue effect comparable between skin and tendon (rescue_comparison). Finally, if we look at all of the important genes across the whole experiment what do we see (all)? The experiment starts to become easier to handle when viewed this way. Especially as once executed (after 15 minutes or so of runtime) each of these questions and more will be fully answered. After discussion, panel selection and minor plot tweaking final manuscript figures can be quickly assembled. \n"

This is purely visual, and does not affect the results.  \n**A further and highly useful feature of ,order=** is that it can be used to add sample groups that are not necessarily part of the DE or MDE - without actually affecting the result. For example, in a DE comparing WT to KO we might might want to know: at the genes that differ between WT and KO exclusively how do they behave in KO_rescue? To anser this we could use: \nThis feature is particularly useful when using DE files generated from complex linear models, as it allows interaction terms (such as age, sex, etc) to be plotted alongside the differential terms.  \n"

        "value": "<a name=\"FAQ\"></a>\n\n<br>\n\n**Does Searchlight 2 check my input data?** Yes. Searchlight2 thoroughly checks the integrity and format of all input data. Files which are in the wrong format (for example don't include numbers where they should, or the correct headers) are reported. In addition, all input parameters are checked for format.\n\n<br>\n\n**I am interested in exploring coding genes separately from non-coding genes. Can I do this?** Yes, Searchlight2 includes biotypes in the background file, and automatically runs a separate analysis for each type. Simply supply a background file with the appropriate biotypes. See ([basic input files](#Basic_input_files) for more information).\n\n<br>\n\n**I have used linear modeling with interaction terms for my differential expression. Which workflow does this fall under?** Though the interaction terms have been included in your model it is still a differential expression analysis (DE). Such models simply consider a pairwise interaction taking into account the effect of the interaction terms. It can however be useful to visualise the interaction terms alongside the differential results. This can be achieved using the order= sub-parameter\n\n<br>\n\n**There are plots in the plot folder but they don't appear in the report. All I see is a blank space. What\u2019s going on?** The typical issue in this case is that either you are looking at a zipped version of the entire results folder (it must be unzipped). Or the report.html file has been moved somehow from its original folder. It must be located in the same directory as the plots folder. If neither of these are the case, please contact us. \n\n<br>\n\n\n**I ran Searchlight2 but I can't see any plots in the plots folder. What\u2019s going on?** Most likely the root cause is missing R libraries or an unforeseen bug in one of the plots in the R script. This will have a knock-on effect as Searclight2 runs the workflow R-scripts. Firstly ensure that you have installed all of the libraries listed in [Download and first time setup](#Download_and_first_time_setup). Next, try running the R script for the plots in question (e.g. plots/workflow.r) in R and investigating the error directly. If you cannot fix this easily, please contact us.\n\n<br>\n\n**My computer is not connected to the web, does this matter?** No. Searchlight 2 does not connect to anything external whatsoever, at any point. This is a deliberate design feature.\n\n<br>\n\n**I want to use p values instead of adjusted p values. Can I do this?** Yes, If you wish to use P values instead of adjusted P simply \u201cmunge\u201d your file. I.e. replace the adjusted p values with the p values in the differential expression file. The format of each file is fixed \u2013 to make sure the user understands what they are doing, but its up to the user what they put in it.\n\n<br>\n\n**I am using a custom background file, and don\u2019t have both gene IDs and gene symbols, nor gene biotypes what can I do?** As above though the format of each file is fixed it is up to the user what goes in. Try simply using the same values for IDs and symbols. Provided it matches the expression matrix and any differential expression files it doesn\u2019t actually matter what is in these columns. So long as you are comfortable with what you are inputting. The same logic applies to biotypes, simply set them all to \u201cgene\u201d. \n\n<br>\n\n**I have an issue that is not covered by the manual or FAQ.** Don\u2019t we all! Email us directly using the contact provided. Though we are a small team we will try to respond ASAP.\n\n<br>\n"

The next (and final) step is to set-up and run the command. Searchlight2 can be executed by navigating to the /Searchlight2/Software/ folder and running: \n\n<br>\n\n```\npython Searchlight2.py \n```\n\n<br>\n\nThis will throw an error as you have not yet added the input parameters. Searchlight2 parameters have the format --parameter,sub-parameter=value. The key parameters are: \n\n<br>\n\n```\n--out path=my_desired_output_path\n--bg file=path_to_my_background_file\n--em file=path_to_my_expression_matrix_file\n--ss file=path_to_my_sample_sheet_file\n--de file=path_to_my_differential_expression_file,numerator=sample_group_1,denominator=sample_group_2\n```\n\n<br>\n\nMostly this is straightforward, except for the --de parameter which requires the additional sub-parameters: \"numerator=\" and denomintor=\". Here you are expected to enter the names of the two sample groups that are being compared differentially. For example: if the DE file was of a comparison between WT and KO samples, we would enter numerator=KO,denominator=WT. The numerator should always be the sample group where a positive fold change in the DE file means an increase in expression. **It is very important to note** that the values entered into numerator= and denominator= (in this case KO & WT) must also be in the sample_group column of the sample sheet. With the same spelling. **Furthermore all paths must be complete from \"root\"** and not abbreviated from the working directory. Don't forget to wrap file paths in \"\" if they contain spaces. **Importantly, do not put spaces between sub-parameters.**\n\n<br>\n\nTo execute Searchlight2 using the provided sample dataset we might run the following. In this example we have simply placed Searchlight2 into a downloads folder, where we will also store the results. This will execute a comprehensive Searchlight2 analysis, producing statistical analysis, intermediate files, plots, reports, r-code and a Shiny app.\n\n<br>\n\n```\npython Searchlight2.py --out path=/home/john/Downloads/results --bg file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/backgrounds/mouse_GRCm38.p6.tsv --em file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/EM.tsv --ss file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/SS.tsv --de file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/DE_WT_vs_KO.tsv,numerator=KO,denominator=WT\n```\n\n<br>\n\nBroken down the command looks like this. \n\n<br>\n\n```\npython Searchlight2.py \n--out path=/home/john/Downloads/results \n--bg file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/backgrounds/mouse_GRCm38.p6.tsv \n--em file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/EM.tsv \n--ss file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/SS.tsv \n--de file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/DE_WT_vs_KO.tsv,numerator=KO,denominator=WT\n```\n\n<br>\n\nThe default settings for deciding statistical significance are p.adj <= 0.05 and an absolute log2 fold change of >= 0.5 (i.e. at least 1.58 fold). These can be altered by using the log2fold= and p.adj= sub-parameters of the --de parameter. For example, re-running the sample command with the following would use a p.adj cut-off of 0.01 and no log2 fold cut-off:\n\n<br>\n\n```\n--de file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/DE_WT_vs_KO.tsv,numerator=KO,denominator=WT,p.adj=0.01,log2fold=0\n```\n\n<br>\n\nBy default Searchlight will look for R in the computers path file. On an Ubuntu or Mac machine this is equivalent to running the RScript command in the terminal. You can explicitly specify the path to the RScript command using the --r command:\n\n```\n--r path=\"C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.2.3\\bin\\Rscript.exe\"\n```\n\n**This is necessary if you are using a Windows machine** or if Searchlight runs successfully to completion, but no plots appear in the plots folders or report.\n\n<br>\n\nSome examples of the types of plots expected are shown below. See later sections of this guide for extensive additional analysis types, such as pathway, regulator and signature analysis.\n\n<br>\n\nExample figure 1            |  Example figure 2\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n<img src=https://github.com/Searchlight2/Searchlight2/blob/master/media/Slide1.JPG  width=\"500\">  |  <img src=https://github.com/Searchlight2/Searchlight2/blob/master/media/Slide2.JPG  width=\"500\">\n\n<br>\n\n\n"

The next (and final) step is to set-up and run the command. Searchlight2 can be executed by navigating to the /Searchlight2/Software/ folder and running: \n\n<br>\n\n```\npython Searchlight2.py \n```\n\n<br>\n\nThis will throw an error as you have not yet added the input parameters. Searchlight2 parameters have the format --parameter,sub-parameter=value. The key parameters are: \n\n<br>\n\n```\n--out path=my_desired_output_path\n--bg file=path_to_my_background_file\n--em file=path_to_my_expression_matrix_file\n--ss file=path_to_my_sample_sheet_file\n--de file=path_to_my_differential_expression_file,numerator=sample_group_1,denominator=sample_group_2\n```\n\n<br>\n\nMostly this is straightforward, except for the --de parameter which requires the additional sub-parameters: \"numerator=\" and denomintor=\". Here you are expected to enter the names of the two sample groups that are being compared differentially. For example: if the DE file was of a comparison between WT and KO samples, we would enter numerator=KO,denominator=WT. The numerator should always be the sample group where a positive fold change in the DE file means an increase in expression. **It is very important to note** that the values entered into numerator= and denominator= (in this case KO & WT) must also be in the sample_group column of the sample sheet. With the same spelling. **Furthermore all paths must be complete from \"root\"** and not abbreviated from the working directory. Don't forget to wrap file paths in \"\" if they contain spaces. **Importantly, do not put spaces between sub-parameters.**\n\n<br>\n\nTo execute Searchlight2 using the provided sample dataset we might run the following. In this example we have simply placed Searchlight2 into a downloads folder, where we will also store the results. This will execute a comprehensive Searchlight2 analysis, producing statistical analysis, intermediate files, plots, reports, r-code and a Shiny app.\n\n<br>\n\n```\npython Searchlight2.py --out path=/home/john/Downloads/results --bg file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/backgrounds/mouse_GRCm38.p6.tsv --em file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/EM.tsv --ss file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/SS.tsv --de file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/DE_WT_vs_KO.tsv,numerator=KO,denominator=WT\n```\n\n<br>\n\nBroken down the command looks like this. \n\n<br>\n\n```\npython Searchlight2.py \n--out path=/home/john/Downloads/results \n--bg file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/backgrounds/mouse_GRCm38.p6.tsv \n--em file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/EM.tsv \n--ss file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/SS.tsv \n--de file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/DE_WT_vs_KO.tsv,numerator=KO,denominator=WT\n```\n\n<br>\n\nThe default settings for deciding statistical significance are p.adj <= 0.05 and an absolute log2 fold change of >= 0.5 (i.e. at least 1.58 fold). These can be altered by using the log2fold= and p.adj= sub-parameters of the --de parameter. For example, re-running the sample command with the following would use a p.adj cut-off of 0.01 and no log2 fold cut-off:\n\n<br>\n\n```\n--de file=/home/john/Downloads/Searchlight2/sample_datasets/DE_WT_vs_KO.tsv,numerator=KO,denominator=WT,p.adj=0.01,log2fold=0\n```\n\n<br>\n\nBy default Searchlight will look for R in the computers path file. On an Ubuntu or Mac machine this is equivalent to running the RScript command in the terminal. You can explicitly specify the path to the RScript command using the --r command:\n\n```\n--r path=\"C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.2.3\\bin\\Rscript.exe\"\n```\n\n**This is necessary if you are using a Windows machine** or if Searchlight runs successfully to completion, but no plots appear in the plots folders or report.\n\n<br>\n\nSome examples of the types of plots expected are shown below. See later sections of this guide for extensive additional analysis types, such as pathway, regulator and signature analysis.\n\n<br>\n\nExample figure 1            |  Example figure 2\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\n<img src=https://github.com/Searchlight2/Searchlight2/blob/master/media/Slide1.JPG  width=\"500\">  |  <img src=https://github.com/Searchlight2/Searchlight2/blob/master/media/Slide2.JPG  width=\"500\">\n\n<br>\n\n\n"
