        "value": "We develop a network regularized logistic regression model, GuidingNet, to predict DNA methyltransferases\u2019 (DNMTs) genome-wide binding by integrating gene expression, chromatin accessibility, sequence, and protein-protein interaction data. GuidingNet accurately predicted methylation experimental data validated DNMTs\u2019 binding, outperformed single data source based and sparsity regularized methods, and performed well in within and across tissue prediction for several DNMTs in human and mouse. Importantly, GuidingNet can reveal transcription co-factors assisting DNMTs for methylation establishment. This provides biological understanding in the DNMTs' binding specificity in different tissues and demonstrate the advantage of network regularization. In addition, GuidingNet achieves good performance for chromatin regulators\u2019 binding other than DNMTs and serves as a useful method for studying chromatin regulator binding and function.\n \n"

And chromatin accessibility data as a matrix with element by sample dimensions. TF binding strength are calculated from motif scan algorithm. TF expression specificity score is calculated from gene across tissues expression data. GC content is the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) in a DNA region. PPI and co-expression network are extracted from protein-protein interaction and gene across tissues expression data respectively. The training labels are from ChIP-seq data.\n \n"
