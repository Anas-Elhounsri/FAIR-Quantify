The main data matrices required by the function should have measurements for one sample in each row, and each column should correspond to one variable.\n\nWhen calling the function, the package automatically estimates the (differential) correlation matrices, and performs permutation and parametric tests as instructed by the user. The user may run the function multiple times (with different arguments) on multiple datasets by assigning a different name to each run; each run can be visualized by selecting it from a dropdown menu in \\texttt{viz.html}.\n\nAfter the R code finishes running, you can open ```viz.html``` in your **current R working directory** from your local browser ([Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)/[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/)) for visualizations of the estimates. Although less interesting, under your **current R working directory**, the ```plots``` folder contains some static graphs and heatmaps for your reference.
