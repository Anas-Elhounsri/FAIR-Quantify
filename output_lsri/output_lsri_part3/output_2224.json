It can make use of highly-parallel processors such as those in graphics cards (GPUs) found in many PCs. \nThe project involves an open API and fast implementations of a library for evaluating phylogenetic likelihoods (continuous time Markov processes) of biomolecular sequence evolution. \nThe aim is to provide high performance evaluation 'services' to a wide range of phylogenetic software, both Bayesian samplers and Maximum Likelihood optimizers. This allows these packages to make use of implementations that make use of optimized hardware such as graphics processing units. \nSupport for BEAGLE is experimental or in development for the following packages: \n"
