The .csv file from sigEvl function will contain an ordered table. Output of both of these two functions have the following contents:\n\n**query** This provides the file path of the query file that had been compared with the hit file.\n\n**hit** This provides the file path of the hit file that had been compared with the query file.\n\n**jaccard_index** This provides the jaccard index score between the query file and the hit file. The jaccard index provides the relative similarity between each file pairing, and indicates the relative amount of overlap of locations for two bed files over the total locations of both bed files. An index of 0 indicates no similarities and 1 indicates an identical file; thus, the greater the jaccard index, the more similar the files are.\n\n**pi_score** This provides the pi score between the query file and the hit file. The pi score takes into account the significance of the similarity using the p-value, and is calculated using the jaccard index mean ratio (real jaccard index/mean of generated background file jaccard indexes) multiplied by the negative logarithm of the p-value. The larger the pi score, the more significant the similarities between the query file and the hit file are.\n\n**p_value** This provides the p-value of the query bed file jaccard index in relation to a generated amount of background jaccard indexes. Essentially, the p-value is created by comparing the real jaccard index to the jaccard indexes of randomly generated background bed files. The p-value signifies how significant the jaccard index between the database file and the query bed file is, and how it compares to jaccard scores generated solely by random chance. This value increases in relability as the parameter n increases. The smaller the p-value, the more significant the jaccard index between the database file and the query bed file is.\n\n**five number summary** This provide a general statistical summary of the jaccard indexes of the background bed files that were generated. The background files are created with the same length as the query file, and their locations are randomly generated. By deriving jaccard indexes of these randomly generated background files, we get an idea of the significance of the similarity (determining whether this similarity may or may not have been due to statistical chance or if the similarity differs from random expectation).\n"
