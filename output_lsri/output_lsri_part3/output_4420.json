There are many ways to contribute, such as writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code that can be incorporated into PlantSeg itself.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo set up the development environment, run:\n\n```bash\nmamba env create -f environment-dev.yml\nconda activate plant-seg-dev\n```\n\nTo install PlantSeg in development mode, run:\n\n```bash\npip install -e . --no-deps\n```\n\n## Coding Style\n\nPlantSeg uses _Ruff_ for linting and formatting. _Ruff_ is compatible with _Black_ for formatting. Ensure you have _Black_ set as the formatter with a line length of 120.\n\n## Before Submitting a Pull Request\n\n### Run Tests with `pytest`\n\nEnsure that `pytest` is installed in your conda environment. To run the tests, simply use:\n\n```bash\npytest\n```\n\n### Check Syntax with `pre-commit`\n\nThe PlantSeg repository uses pre-commit hooks to ensure the code is correctly formatted and free of linting issues. While not mandatory, it is encouraged to check your code before committing by running:\n\n```bash\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n\nCommit messages are important. Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.\n\nFor efficiency, pytest is not included in the pre-commit hooks. Please run the tests separately.\n"

        "value": "# Installation\n\n## Prerequisites for Conda package\n\n* Linux, Windows, macOS (not all features are available on macOS)\n* (Optional) Nvidia GPU with official Nvidia drivers installed for GPU acceleration\n\n## Install Mamba\n\nThe easiest way to install PlantSeg is by using the [conda (Anaconda)](https://www.anaconda.com/) or\n[mamba (Miniforge)](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package manager. We recommend using `mamba` because it is faster and usually more consistent than `conda`.\n\n=== \"Linux\"\n\n    To download Miniforge open a terminal and type:\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -L -O \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\n    bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\n    ```\n\n    Then install by typing:\n\n    ```bash\n    bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\n    ```\n\n    and follow the installation instructions.\n    Please refer to the [Miniforge repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) for more information, troubleshooting and uninstallation instructions.\n    The miniforge installation file `Miniforge3-*.sh` can be deleted now.\n\n=== \"Windows/macOS\"\n    The first step required to use the pipeline is installing mamba. The installation can be done by downloading the installer from the [Miniforge repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). There you can find the download links for the latest version of Miniforge, troubleshooting and uninstallation instructions.\n\n## Install PlantSeg using Mamba\n\nPlantSeg can be installed directly by executing in the terminal (or PowerShell on Windows). For `conda` users, the command is identical, just replace `mamba` with `conda`.\n\n=== \"Linux/Windows\"\n\n    * NVIDIA GPU version, CUDA=12.x\n\n        ```bash\n        mamba create -n plant-seg -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch pytorch-cuda=12.1 pyqt plant-seg --no-channel-priority\n        ```\n\n    * NVIDIA GPU version, CUDA=11.x\n\n        ```bash\n        mamba create -n plant-seg -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.8 pyqt plant-seg --no-channel-priority\n        ```\n\n    * CPU version\n\n        ```bash\n        mamba create -n plant-seg -c pytorch -c nvidia -c conda-forge pytorch cpuonly pyqt plant-seg --no-channel-priority\n        ```\n\n=== \"macOS\"\n\n    * Apple silicon version\n\n        ```bash\n        mamba create -n plant-seg -c pytorch -c conda-forge python=3.11 pytorch::pytorch pyqt plant-seg --no-channel-priority\n        ```\n\nIf you used older versions of PlantSeg, please delete the old config files in `~/.plantseg_models/configs/` after installing new PlantSeg.\n\nThe above command will create new conda environment `plant-seg` together with all required dependencies.\n\nPlease refer to the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) website for more information on the available versions of PyTorch and the required CUDA version. The GPU version of Pytorch will also work on CPU only machines but has a much larger installation on disk.\n\n## Optional dependencies\n\nIf you want to use the headless mode of PlantSeg, you need to install `dask[distributed]`:\n\n```bash\nconda activate plant-seg\nmamba install dask distributed\n```\n\nSome types of compressed tiff files require an additional package to be load correctly (e.g.: Zlib, ZSTD, LZMA, ...).\nTo run PlantSeg on those stacks, you need to install `imagecodecs`.\nIn the terminal:\n\n```bash\nconda activate plant-seg\npip install imagecodecs\n```\n\nExperimental support for SimpleITK watershed segmentation has been added to PlantSeg version 1.1.8.\nThese features can be used only after installing the SimpleITK package:\n\n```bash\nconda activate plant-seg\npip install SimpleITK\n```\n"
