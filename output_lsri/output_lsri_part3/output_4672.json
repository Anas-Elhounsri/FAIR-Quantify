As with radiometric terrain flattening, this module relies also on a DEM, in combination with the precise orbit determination applied in step 1.\nThe output of this module is gamma_0 in geographic coordinates with 10 m pixel spacing.\nAnother step often useful for SAR data processing is spatial speckle filtering. However, due to the approach taken in this manuscript, that is, calculating median backscatter over multiple acquisitions, smoothing of speckle effects takes place implicitly in the time, instead of in space, thus not causing any further loss of geometric detail.\n"
