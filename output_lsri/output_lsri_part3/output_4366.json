Thanks so much for your time and consideration. It's rad people like you that make Graphein such a cool computational biology tool.\n\nI wrote this contributor's guide to help newcomers feel welcome. Getting started with a new project can be complicated and I wanted to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute and as easy as possible for me to help.\n\nCurrently any sincere pull request is a good request.\nGraphein is still evolving so there are so many way to contribute!\nHere's a list of ideas but feel free to suggest anything I may have forgotten to include.\n\n* Feature requests - especially cool new algorithms with citations.\n* Visualisation, plots, analysis functions\n* Featurisition utils\n* Devops features. Github action bots, linters, deployment, etc.\n* Unit and integration tests.\n* Writing, editing, and translating tutorials, documentation, or blog posts.\n* Auditing for accessibility.\n* Bug reports.\n* Bug triaging.\n* Community management.\n* Art! Dreams! Your excellence!\n* Code that can be pulled into Graphein itself.\n\n## Contributor guidelines\n\n#### Excellence, and the contributor's code of conduct\n\nFirst up, most importantly we have a contributor's code of conduct. For some reason the internet is a dehumanizing experience and it's easy to forget that aside from the bots we're all humans on this thing. Approach each other with kindness. Please read our [contributor's code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and when in doubt just remember our one true rule as once spoken by the ever so wise duo of Bill and Ted.\n\n`Bill: Be excellent, ... to each other, ...`\n\n`Ted: and party on, dudes! [sic]`\n\n![Abraham Licoln saying, \"Be Excellent to each other and party on dudes!\". [sic]](https://media.giphy.com/media/ef0zYcF7AKu4b0Sns6/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\n\n#### Do-ocracy\n\nGraphein runs on do-ocracy. Do-ocracy is a simple concept. If you don't like something you don't need permission to fix it, you can just go ahead and fix it! If you actually want to merge your fix, or contribute in someway that benefits everybody, it'd really, really, really help if you got some light consensus from the rest of the Graphein development community but hey, if you really need to do something then you just gotta do it! Just don't expect me to merge it if it doesn't meet our technical criteria or isn't quite right for Graphein.\n\n#### Technical requirements\n\nPart of what makes Graphein so special is that we have standards. DNA is already spaghetti code on its own and we just don't need to add to that.\n\nAll successfully merged pull requests must meet the following criteria:\n\n* All current tests must pass.\n\n* At least one new test must be written to prove that the merged feature works correctly.\n\n* At least one new example must be written to demonstrate the merged feature in our docs.\n\n* Build tests must pass for all currently supported systems and package managers. Linux, Mac OSX, Windows, etc.\n\n* Code must be clean, readable, and commented. How you do that is up to you!\n\nDon't worry if you submit a pull request and all the tests break and the code is not readable. We won't merge it just yet and then you can get some feedback about what needs to be changed before we do!\n\n#### Be welcoming\n\nAs one final guideline please be welcoming to newcomers and encourage new contributors from all walks of life. I want Graphein to be for everyone and that includes you and people who don't look, sound, or act like you!\n\n## Your first contribution\n\nUnsure where to begin contributing to Graphein? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:\n\n[Beginner issues](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22beginner%22+) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.\n\n[Good first issues](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein/contribute) - issues which are good for first time contributors.\n\n[Help wanted issues](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.\n\n[Feature requests](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein/labels/enhancement) - before requesting a new feature search through previous feature requests to see if it's already been requested. If not then feel free to submit a request and tag it with the enhancement tag!\n\n#### Working on your first Pull Request?\n\nYou can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\nYou can also check out [these](http://makeapullrequest.com/) [tutorials](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/).\n\nAt this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:\n\n## Getting started\n\nFor something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:\n\n1. Create your own fork of the code.\n2. Make a branch in your fork\n3. Do the changes in your fork's branch.\n4. Send a pull request.\n\n### Virtual Environments and Development Containers\n\nIn order to simplify the development experience, and environment setup, the Graphein Github repository comes packaged to support *Github CodeSpaces* and [*VSCode Development Containers*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started). *Github CodeSpaces* will give you ability to spin up a Github hosted instance of Ubuntu that would allow you run, test, develop Graphein from the browser. *VSCode Development Containers* in turn will allow your installation of VSCode to spin up a docker instance of Ubuntu on your computer and automatically mount your code onto it so that you continue developing on this docker instance that has all the required development environment setup.\n\n### Recommended Plugins\n\nWhether you're a beginner with Python or you're an experienced developer, You should see the suggestions popup automatically when you goto the *Plugins* tab in VSCode. Using these plugins can help accelerate the development experience and also allow you to work more collaboratively with other Graphein developers.\n\n## How to report a bug\n\n#### Security disclosures\n\nIf you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. I've yet to set up a security email for this so please in the interim DM me on twitter for my email [@arian_jamasb](https://twitter.com/arian_jamasb) or grab my contact from my [website](jamasb.io).\n\nIn order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:\n\n* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?\n* Can I disable something for other people?\n\nIf the answer to either of those two questions are \"yes\", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer \"no\" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just DM me [@arian_jamasb](https://twitter.com/arian_jamasb) for my personal email until I can set up a security related email.\n\n#### Non-security related bugs\n\nFor non-security bug reports please [submit it using this template!](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)\n\n## How to suggest a feature or enhancement\n\nIf you want to suggest a feature it's as easy as filling out this [issue template](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=), but before you do please [check to see if it's already been suggested!](https://github.com/a-r-j/graphein/labels/enhancement)\n\n## How add a recommended VSCode Plugin\n\nGraphein comes with a set of recommended plugins for VSCode. If you have suggestions that will simplify life for the Graphein dev community, consider doing a pull-request after modifying `.vscode/extensions.json`.\n\n## In closing\n\nThanks, for reading and I'm super psyched to see what you'll do with Graphein!\n"
