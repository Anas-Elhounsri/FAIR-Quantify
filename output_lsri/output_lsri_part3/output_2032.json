We recommend executing DeCiFer on multi-processing computing machines as the running time will scale down nearly proportionally with the number of parallel jobs, which can be specified with the argument `-j`. If the parameter is not specified, then DeCiFer will attempt to use all available CPUs; however, when using a computing cluster, we strongly recommend the user to always specifies `-j` in order to match the number of requested CPUs and avoid computing competition. Finally, note that also required memory also scales with the number of parallel processes; however in all previous tests on thousands of mutations with high number of parallel processes, DeCiFer never required more than 80GB of RAM. Please lower `-j` in case of exceeding memory.\n\n<a name=\"demos\"></a>"

These CIs have been corrected for multiple tests. Specifically, for each cluster, we find the lower CI by finding the X=[0.025/(number of hypothesis tests)] quantile, where the number of tests corresponds to (number of clusters)\\*(number of samples for patient). The same procedure is used for the upper CI, by finding the quantile that corresponds to 1-X.\n\nThese cluster CIs may also be found in the output file ending in `_cluster.CIs.tsv`. This file contains this information in a more condensed format, reporting only the upper and lower CIs for each cluster for each sample (in column `f_lb` and `f_ub` respectively). These numbers may contain \"NaN\" if no mutations were assigned to that particular cluster.\n\nThe file ending in `_model_selection.tsv` shows how decifer selected the best value of K clusters. \n\nLastly, the file ending in `_Outliers_output.tsv` contains SNVs that were flagged as outliers: the variant allele frequency (VAF) of the SNV was more than 1.5 (default) standard deviations away from the VAF of the assigned cluster center. Users may change this behavior via the `--vafdevfilter` option. This default behavior filters out noisy data or germline contamination that manifests as e.g. SNVs being assigned to the truncal cluster yet having very low DCF values in the `point_estimate_DCF` column of the output file.\n\n<a name=\"requirements\"></a>"

        "value": "- We recommend to initially select a reasonably high maximum number of clusters with option `-K`, e.g. a number that is ~2-3 times as large as `(number of samples for the patient)+2`. Further increase `-K` if the selected best number of clusters is close to the maximum limit.\n- DeCiFer outputs the decreasing objective function which is used to select the number of clusters based on the Elbow criterion; if the function is still substantially decreasing near the selected maximum number of clusters please try to further increase this value.\n- You can adapt the sensitivity of the Elbow criterion by adjusting the corresponding `--elbow` parameter. In our experience, decreasing this value to ~0.002 gives better results for whole-genome sequences collected from ~5 samples from the same tumor; elbow values higher than this can result in overclustering with clusters containing visually distinct groups of DCF/CCF values.\n- Although DeCiFer performs model selection to select the best number of K clusters, given the specified range of clusters from `--mink` to `--maxk` and the `--elbow` parameter, you can use the `--printallk` to print the output for all values of K specified. One output file is printed per value of K, each ending in `_K#.tsv` where `#` is the number of clusters. This can be useful to quickly explore how results may vary with different sensitivities, compared to re-running DeCiFer with different `--elbow` values.\n- If DeCiFer is taking more than a few days to run -- from having many SNVs, many samples, or both -- using fewer restarts (e.g. `--restarts 10`) *may* be a sensible solution. We have observed very similar results for some datasets using a value of 100 and a lower value of 10.\n- Beta: use the `--conservativeCIs` flag to have DeCiFer compute CIs that are wider and more conservative. This approach uses the DCF point values of the mutations assigned to a cluster to compute the cluster's CIs. Specifically, we compute the median of the distribution of DCF values (one for each mutation assigned to the cluster) and use bootstrap resampling to calculate CIs. To be conservative, we use the minimum and maximum observed median across 10,000 bootstrap replicates, instead of the medians that correspond to e.g. 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles.\n\n<a name=\"development\"></a>"
