Defaults to 1e-6.\n- `learning_rate`: dictates how large an update to the weights will be. If you find the loss function oscillating, try setting a lower value.

        "value": "ADMIXTURE allows reusing computations in the _projective analysis_ mode, in which the `P` (`F`, frequencies) matrix is fixed to an already known result and only the assignments are computed. Due to the nature of our algorithm, assignments can be computed for unseen data by simply feeding the data through the encoder. This mode can be run by typing `infer` instead of `train` right after the `neural-admixture` call.\n\nFor example, assuming we have a trained Neural ADMIXTURE (named `nadm_test`) in the path `./outputs`, one could run inference on unseen data (`./data/unseen_data.vcf`) via the following command:\n\n```console\n$ neural-admixture infer --name nadm_test --save_dir ./outputs --out_name unseen_nadm_test --data_path ./data/unseen_data.vcf\n```\n\nFor this command to work, files `./outputs/nadm_test.pt` and `./outputs/nadm_test_config.json`, which are training outputs, must exist. In this case, only a `.Q` will be created, which will contain the assignments for this data (the parameter of the flag `out_name` will be used to generate the output file name). This file will be written in the `--save_dir` directory (in this case, `./outputs`).\n"

The path of the file is specified using the `--init_file` argument.\n- `--freeze_decoder`: indicates that the decoder weights will be frozen during training.\n\nIf the second argument is skipped, then the decoder weights will be updated and the solution won't yield exactly the same `P`/`F` matrix that was used as input.\n"

This can be very benificial, especially when dealing with large imbalances in the data (_e.g_ data contains 1K samples from Pop1 and 50 samples from Pop2).\n\nIn order to use the supervised mode, the flag `--supervised` must be passed when invoking the software, along with a `--populations_path` pointing to the file where the ancestries are defined. The latter file must be a single-column, headerless, plain text file where row `i` denotes the ancestry for the `i`-th sample in the data. The character `-` must be used for samples whose ancestry is missing/unknown. If validation data is provided, then the corresponding populations file path must be passed through the `--validation_population_path` argument.\n\nThe supervised mode works by adding a scaled classification loss to the bottleneck of the algorithm (Equation 5 of the paper). The scaling factor can have a big impact on the performance. If it is too small, then the supervised loss will have little impact on the training, so results would be similar to an unsupervised run. On the other hand, if it is too large, then the supervision will dominate training, making the network overconfident in its predictions: essentially, one would get only binary assignments. The default value of the scaling factor is _\u03b7=0.05_, and can be controlled using the parameter `--supervised_loss_weight`.\n\nBasically, if on validation data you are getting single-ancestry estimations when you expect admixed estimations, try setting a smaller value for the supervised loss scaling factor _\u03b7_ (`--supervised_loss_weight`) and/or a larger value for the L2 penalty term _\u03bb_ (`--l2_penalty`, defaults to 0.0005); and vice versa.\n\nMoreover, note that the initialization method chosen will have no effect, as the supervised method is always used when using the supervised version.\n"
