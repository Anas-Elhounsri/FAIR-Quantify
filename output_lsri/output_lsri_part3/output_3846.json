[Contact us](mailto:liqing.tian@stjude.org) if your bam is based on other reference version.\n- `genome` is either `GRCh37-lite` or `GRCh38_no_alt`. CICERO only support the two human reference genome versions.\n- `refdir` is the reference file directory specific to CICERO. Download [Reference Files](#reference) below. e.g. `-r /home/user/software/CICERO/reference_hg38/` or `-r /home/user/software/CICERO/reference_hg19/`\n- `outdir` is user defined output file folder.\n- `junctions` is the junctions file output from RNApeg. See [Generate Junctions](#junctions) below. CICERO can detect fusion by analysis of splice junction reads. If this option is omitted, fusions generated by small deletions may be missed as these events may lack the soft-clipped reads.\n- `threshold` CICERO first detects all soft-clipped positions supported by >=2 reads from bam file. For sample with <=threshold (default 200,000) soft-clipped positions, CICERO will detect fusions based on these soft-clipped positons; otherwise, to speed-up CICERO running, CICERO will detect fusions based on soft-clipped positions supported by >=sc_cutoff (3, default for optimize mode, see below) reads. For sample with lots of soft-clipped positions, a smaller threshold will speed-up CICERO running, however, some fusion events (i.e. only supported by 2 reads) may be missed.\n- `sc_cutoff` controls the number of soft clip reads required to support a putative site. The default is 2, but for samples with large numbers of soft clip reads, it may be desirable to require additional support to reduce the computational time required.\n- `sc_shift` sets the threshold for considering events to be the same site.\n- `optimize` defaults to ON. This sets `sc_cutoff` to 3 for samples where the number of soft clip sites exceeds 200,000. It also sets `sc_shift` to 10 which sets the distance to consider events the same.\n- `-no-optimize` turns optimizations off. This can increase sensitivity, but increases the computational requirements.\n\nThe final CICERO fusion result file will be located at `<outdir>/CICERO_DATADIR/<sample name>/final_fusions.txt`. Use the following [guide](https://university.stjude.cloud/docs/genomics-platform/workflow-guides/rapid-rnaseq/#interpreting-results) to interpret the results.\n\nTo visualize CICERO fusion output you can load the final fusion output file at https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/FusionEditor/.\n"
