        "value": "Glimmer-MG is a system for finding genes in environmental shotgun DNA\nsequences. Glimmer-MG (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov ModelER -\nMetaGenomics) uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) to identify the\ncoding regions and distinguish them from noncoding DNA. The IMM\napproach, described in our Nucleic Acids Research paper on Glimmer 1.0\nand in our subsequent paper on Glimmer 2.0 , uses a combination of\nMarkov models from 1st through 8th-order, weighting each model\naccording to its predictive power. Glimmer uses 3-periodic\nnonhomogenous Markov models in its IMMs. \nGlimmer-MG addresses the challenges of metagenomics gene\nprediction. Prediction model training is the main reason Glimmer3\ncannot be applied to metagenomics sequences. Rather than rely on GC%\nto find evolutionary relative genomes for training, Glimmer-MG instead\nfinds phylogenetic classifications using Phymm and parameterizes gene\nprediction models using those classifications. Glimmer-MG also\nclusters the sequences using Scimm, which groups together sequences\nthat are likely from the same organism. Analogous to iterative schemes\nthat are useful for whole genomes, Glimmer-MG retrains prediction\nmodels within each cluster on the initial gene predictions before\nmaking a final set of predictions. To account for fragmented genes,\nGlimmer-MG incorporates a model for gene length, in which partial\ngenes are carefully handled. Finally, Glimmer-MG can predict\ninsertions and deletions in the sequence by branching into a different\nframe at low quality base calls such as homopolymer runs in 454\nsequences. \nReference:\nKelley DR, Liu B, Delcher A, Pop M, Salzberg S.\nGene prediction with Glimmer on metagenomic sequences augmented by\nphylogenetic classification and clustering.\nNucleic Acids Research, 40:1 e9 (2012). \n"
