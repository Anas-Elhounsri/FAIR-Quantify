This file\nis used by default and can be edited to change PyHDX default settings.\n\nAlternatively, users can create additional `.yaml` configuration files in this directory, after\nwhich the scripts ``local_cluster.py`` and ``serve.py`` prompt the user for which file to use.\n\nThe section ``server`` configures the panel server settings. In this section the additional keys\n``port`` and ``websocket_origin`` can be added, which are passed to ``panel.serve``. See the panel \n[Deploy and Export](https://panel.holoviz.org/user_guide/Deploy_and_Export.html) deploy section for \nmore information.\n\n"

Default color transforms can be changed with the `ColorTransformControl` control panel.\r\n- The NGL protein viewer is now implemented as `ReactiveHTML`, obviating the need for custom bokeh models\r\n- Timepoint zero is by default not selected\r\n- The template was updated to the `FastGridTemplate`.\r\n\r\n**New features:**\r\n- Scatterplot of RFU values per residue.\r\n- Create differential HDX \u0394\u0394G comparisons directly.\r\n- Download .zip session file and restore session from session file.\r\n- Download \u0394G/\u0394\u0394G proplot/matplotlib graphs (linear_bars, scatter, rainbowclouds) in .png, .pdf. .svg or .eps format.\r\n- Export data tables as hex color code tables (for supported tables)\r\n- Export of pymol coloring scripts for RFU values\r\n\r\n**Refactors:**\r\n- `deltaG` was refactored to `dG` (`ddG` for `deltadeltaG`)\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n- `csv_to_dataframe` now also accepts `BytesIO` objects\r\n- `local_cluster.default_cluster` now accepts additional kwargs\r\n- Various bugfixes\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Jhsmit/PyHDX/compare/v0.4.0b4...v0.4.0b5",
