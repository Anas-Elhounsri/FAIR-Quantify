In other words, you are feeding WASP the exact curve that you want to calculate the writhe of, and the axis curve calculation is skipped. This allows WASP to be used more generally if you wish to calculate an axis curve for your DNA structure using some other method prior to using WASP to calculate the writhe or if you want to analyze the writhing of a curve that is not DNA or not a result of a MD trajectory (i.e. coronal flux ropes or rod filaments). This format consists of tab spaced cartersian (x,y,z) coordinates on each line with no whitespace between lines. It is important to note that the number of points on the curve should be the same in every frame, as WASP has no way of telling otherwise. When using general format trajectories, some functionalities of WASP are unable to be used such as the ability to stride. See the general format example below for more information. \n"

However, several arguments are worthy of further explanation:\n\n**deleteatoms:** This argument specifies how many points should be deleted *on each side* of an axis curve and should be used (carefully) with open/linear DNA structures, i.e. DNA structures whose ends are not joined. For example, specifying `20` for the deleteatoms argument will delete 20 points from each end of the axis, deleting a total of 40 points. ***deleteatoms should be set to 0 if the DNA structure is closed (circular/knotted) or if the autodelete argument is being used instead***.\n\n**autodelete (-ad):** An alternative to **deleteatoms** that attempts to automatically remove stray axis points by starting the axis routine one full helical turn into the DNA structure on both sides. This argument is meant to be used with open/linear DNA structures and **deleteatoms** should be set to 0 if **autodelete** is used.\n\n**closed (-c, --closed):** This argument can be used to instruct WASP to use a separate routine for evaluating the polar writhe when analyzing closed DNA structures. At this time, the closed writhe routine and the regular polar writhe routine **(-pw)** are equivalent, so this argument is not necessary. \n\n**smooth (--smooth):** Enables a smoothing routine used to improve accuracy when calculating Wp and Wp\\* (recommended)\n\n**debug (-d, --debug):** Writes the backbone atoms used for axis curve calculation and the generated axis curve to separate trajectory files. These trajectory files are XYZ trajectory files that meet the specifications required to be read by VMD. This option is useful for determining how many atoms to delete from an axis curve if analyzing a linear DNA helix with the **deleteatoms** option.\n"
