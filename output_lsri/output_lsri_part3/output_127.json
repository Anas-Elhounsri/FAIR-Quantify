To critically assess the influence of individual cells on the calculated summary statistics, and to detect heterogeneous cell populations or possible confounding factors, such as misclassified or -tracked objects, a direct mapping of gained statistical information onto the actual image data is necessary. VisuStatR allows to visualize time-resolved motility parameters or any other summary statistic onto images in R. Originally, this package was intended to be used with live-cell microscopy images and cell-tracking data. But in general VisuStatR can be used with any kind of data supplying a dataframe with trackIds, time and spatial coordinates (2D/3D), as well as numeric or discrete mapping parameters and corresponding images.\n \n"

        "value": "VisuStatR is especially designed for experimentalists and non-expert users to allow the visual inspection of their tracking and imaging data. The package does not perform automatic image analysis or object tracking itself. It rather allows the combined visualization of raw imaging data with calculated summary statistics to explain specific characteristics and evaluate possible artifacts. Thereby, it supports imaging and tracking software, such as Fiji/TrackMate (Schindelin et al., *Nat. Meth.* 2012, Berg et al. *Nat. Meth.* 2019), and analysis tools, such as CelltrackR (Wortel et al., *ImmunoInf.* 2021), by allowing the combined visualization of their individual outputs within the raw image data. To this end, VisuStatR is able to select and zoom-in on specific objects and tracks using different display modes. \n- the original stacks of 2D/3D images analyzed (with VisuStatR supporting `tiff`, `png`, and `jpeg` or any other image format supported by the `magick` library)  \n- the obtained tracking data  \n- the summary statistics that are evaluated on the image data  \n- when using the Shiny app the tracking data and summary statistics need to be supplied as a `csv`-file   \nThe package acts as a wrapper for annotating provided images with several, modifiable `ggplot2`-layers. With `visustat_frame()`, continous and discrete parameters can be mapped individually on color, shape and size for one timepoint. `visustat_summary()` allows to create a corresponding plot of all given statistics for the whole range of the provided data. A time-resolved image-series can be created with `visustat_all()` which allows to combine mapped frames and summary plots created by `visustat_frame()` and `visustat_summary()`. The output of all functions are `ggplot2`-objects which can further be manipulated in a common manner.\n \n"
