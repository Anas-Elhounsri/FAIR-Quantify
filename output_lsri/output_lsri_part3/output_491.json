        "description": "## Much simpler download of databases\r\n\r\nreCOgnizer relied on `--download-resources` and `--skip-downloaded` parameters for setting up its databases. \r\n\r\n`--download-resources` instructed reCOgnizer to download the files required for its execution, and `--skip-downloaded` instructed it to ignore already downloaded files, if there had simply been the mistake of removing one file.\r\n\r\nNow, reCOGnizer relies on the `recognizer_dwnl.timestamp` to check if databases have already been downloaded. If the file exists, it skips installation. If the file doesn't exist, reCOGnizer will remove all available files, and download everything.\r\n\r\n## COG2KO conversion more reliable\r\n\r\nPreviously, reCOGnizer built the cog2ko conversion as a collection of all KOs available for each protein mapping to the specific COG.\r\n\r\nNow, reCOGnizer uses a similar approach to cog2ec conversion, where it will only assign a KO to a COG where over half of instances of that COG have that particular KO.\r\n\r\nThis obtains a more reliable COG2KO conversion, while keeping KOs for a considerable number of COGs.\r\n\r\nAlso removes the intermediate `ssv` files outputted during construction of the cog2ko database.\r\n\r\n## New parameters --test-run and --output-rpsbproc-columns will usually not be needed\r\n\r\n`--test-run` parameter had to be implemented as consequence of a simpler database downloading. When set, reCOGnizer runs in an abnormal fashion, which is required for the tests at GitHub. reCOGnizer will move the [`cdd.tar.gz` file](https://github.com/iquasere/reCOGnizer/blob/master/ci/cdd.tar.gz) available in the repo, and use it as a valid `cdd.tar.gz` file.\r\n\r\n`--output-rpsbproc-columns` will output the `Superfamilies`, `Sites`, `Motifs` columns, which are usually empty for almost all annotations.\r\n\r\n## Removed some unnecessary files\r\n\r\n`recognizer.log` was produced at working directory. It only included `rpsblast` outputs, mainly for error assessment. Users can obtain that information by running reCOGnizer with the `--debug` parameter, and manually running the faulty commands.\r\n\r\n`taxonomy.rdf` was obtained as part of building `taxonomy.tsv`. Now, reCOgnizer removes it after it outlived its usefulness.\r\n\r\n## Some fixes\r\n\r\nreCOGnizer was not reporting the download of files when the `--quiet` flag was set, except when the files had already been downloaded, and it removed them.\r\n\r\nAlso updated regexes to new format, the `r'regex'` format.",
