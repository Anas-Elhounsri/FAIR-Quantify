It is easier to use a Python-aware [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) to automate this for you. \n\n* Organize your code into functions to facilitate testing and so that methods can be called from other scripts.\n\n* Isolate the main loop of your code under `if __name__ == '__main__'` to be executed only if the script is being run at the top level (from the command line). \n\n* Try to use `argparse` to provide help documentation for command line execution.\n\n* Use lowercase with underscores to separate words for function and variable names.  Do not use [camel-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).\n\n* Every function should open with a [docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257).  If the function is very brief with a small number of self-explanatory arguments, then a one-line docstring is fine.  Otherwise, use a multi-line docstring.  Use `:param varname: description` entries to document arguments. Use `:return: type, description` entries to document return values.   \n\n\n## Committing your code\n\n* Do not push commits to the `master` branch.  All development should be tracked in the `dev` branch and then merged into `master` after it has been tested.  \n* If you are trying to implement something new that can potentially break parts of the code that other developers may be working on, then [create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) and merge it into `dev` after you have finished building and testing the code. \n* Please try to write concise and informative [commit messages](https://xkcd.com/1296/).\n\n\n## Front-end Testing \n\n* Front-end testing is carried out using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). \n* For the purposes of this project, Cypress needs to be installed via direct download. An installation guide can be found [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Direct-download). \n* The `baseUrl` is currently set as `\"http://127.0.0.1:8001/`. Changes to it can be made in `Cypress.json`.\n\n## Semantic Versioning\n\nWe follow [semantic versioning specifications](https://semver.org/). \n\nThe version number (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) consist of the:\n* `MAJOR` version - For changes that break backward compatibility. For example, modifying the JSON data structure required for running the front-end of CoVizu\n* `MINOR` version - For backwards compatible features additions and other minor changes such as modifying documentation\n* `PATCH` version - For backwards compatible bug fixes \n\nWhen opening a pull request, please specify the type of change (`major`, `minor` or `patch`) in the title. _e.g_ `patch: bug fixes for the search interface`."

You need to disable authorization. \n* To enable/disable authorization, open the afore-mentioned `mongod.conf` configuraiton file.\n* Add (remove) the following lines to the bottom of the config file to enable (disable) authorization\n```\nsecurity:\n  authorization: enabled\n```\n#### _NOTE_ : That `whitespace` between `authorization:` and `enabled` might be crucial. \n* After editing those lines, restart the `MongoDB daemon`. \n* To confirm that you've succesfully enabled(disabled) authorization, open `mongosh` without any auth token.\n    * `$ mongosh`\n* Switch to the `admin` database \n    * `$ use admin`\n* View all the databases \n    * `$ show databases`\n* If `MongoDB` prints out something like this then you've succesfully disabled (unsuccesfully enabled) authentication.\n```\nadmin> show databases\nadmin     180.00 KiB\nconfig    108.00 KiB\nlocal     120.00 KiB\n```\n* If instead, `MongoDB` prints out something like this then you've succesfully enabled (unsuccesfully disabled) authentication.\n```\nadmin> show databases\nMongoServerError: command listDatabases requires authentication\n```\n___________________\n\n\n## Creating user accounts\n* On first install, we need to create a `admin` account, and a `covizu` acccount (readonly). To do so, first disable authorization in the `mongod.conf` configuration file\n* Then ensure that your `.env.dev` or `.env.prod` file contains the environment variables for the following\n```\nDATA_FOLDER='data'\nADMIN_USERNAME='admin'\nADMIN_PASSWORD='supersecretpassword'\nCOVIZU_USERNAME='covizu'\nCOVIZU_PASSWORD='supersecretpassword'\nDB_URL='localhost:27017'\n```\n* Before creating the user accounts, first we check for any existing user accounts of the same name as our `ADMIN_USERNAME` or `COVIZU_USERNAME`. Run the following `nodejs` script.\n    * `$ npm run delete-users`\n* To confirm that there are no user accounts with conflicting names open the `mongosh` \n    * `$ mongosh`\n    * `test> use admin`\n    * `test> show users`\n* After deleting any existing user accounts, run the following script\n  * `$ npm run create-users`\n\n\n* Once your user accounts are created, edit the `config` file to enable authorization and restart the service. \n\n## Populating the database\n* If you haven't already, obtain the following data files from our main server at https://filogeneti.ca/covizu/data/:\n* `timetree.nwk`\n* `dbstats.json`\n* `clusters.json`\nand save your local copies under `covizu/data/`.\n* To import these data files into our `MongoDB` database run the following script\n    * `$ npm run update-db1`\n* This will create our primary database and import the `JSON`/`text` records into it.\n* Once the import script has finished executing, start the server by executing the following script\n    * `$ npm run start-db1`\n* Navgiate your browser to `localhost:8001` to verify that it works. \n* If that went well, then run the next script to setup our secondary database\n    * `$ npm run update-db2`\n* After executing the import script, start the server with a connection to the secondary database\n    * `$ npm run start-db2`\n\n## Updating the database\n* To update the database, first obtain the new data files from `https://filogeneti.ca/covizu/data` and replace the files in `covizu/data`\n* If your `node` server is currently using the primary (secondary) database then update the secondary (primary) database\n    * `$ npm run update-db2` (`$ npm run update-db1`) \n* After updating the secondary (primary) database, close the currently running server which is still serving data from the primary(secondary) database and restart the server with a connection to the secondary (primary) database\n    * `$ npm run start-db2` (`$ npm run start-db1`)\n* On the next batch of new data, update the primary (secondaary) database and restart the node server with a connection to the primary (secondary) database\n\n\n## Some useful `mongosh` shell commands\n* To open `mongo` CLI in non-authenticated mode\n    * `$ mongosh`\n* To open `mongo` CLI as an `admin`\n    * `$ mongosh --username admin --authenticationDatabase admin`\n\n* To view all users\n    * Connect as `admin` ()\n    * `use admin`\n    * `show users`\n\n* To delete an existing user `\"myusername\"`\n    * Connect as `admin`\n    * `use admin`\n    * `show users` \n    * `db.dropUser('myusername')`\n\n* To view all collections within a database `\"mydatabase\"` \n    * Connect as `admin`\n    * `use mydatabase`\n    * `show collections`\n\n* To drop the database `\"mydatabase\"`\n    * Connect as `admin`\n    * `use mydatabase`\n    * `db.dropDatabase()`\n\n* To drop the collection `\"mycollection\"` with the database `\"mydatabase\"`\n    * Connect as `admin`\n    * `use mydatabase`\n    * `db.mycollection.drop()`\n"
