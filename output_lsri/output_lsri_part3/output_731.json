        "value": "This script shows how to use the PeakBot framework. In general, first a PeakBot CNN model is trained from a series of LC-HRMS chromatograms and a list of user-provided reference features that resemble the expected chromatographic peaks. For this, the different chromatographic peak shapes (fronting, tailing, etc.) should be considered so that the new PeakBot model can recognize them correctly. Once the training has finished and satisfying results with respect to the different loss and metric values have been reached, the model can be used to detect all similar chromatographic peaks in new LC-HRMS chromatograms in an untargeted manner. \n\nFor training, different reference features must be specified. A comparison has shown that at least 100 different reference features should be provided. However, this can also be different isotopologs of the same feature. Nevertheless care should be taken to select and specify the many different chromatographic peak forms present in the data. \n\nThe format to specify the list of reference features is a simple tab-separated values (tsv) file with the following columns:\n| RT | MZ | LeftRTBorder | RightRTBorder | MZDeviation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1842 | 555.283089 | 1835 | 1847 | 24.5 |\n\nThe column RT specifies the approximate retention time (peak apex) of the reference feature in seconds. \nThe column MZ specifies the approximate mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio of the reference feature. \nThe column LeftRTBorder specifies the approximate retention time of the start of the reference feature in seconds. \nThe column RightRTBorder specifies the approximate retention time of the end of the reference feature in seconds. \nThe column MZDeviation specifies the approximate m/z deviation of the reference feature (approximately the 95% confidence interval). \n\nThe format to specify the list of wall backgrounds is also a simple tsv file with the following columns:\n| MZ | Rtstart | Rtend | MZdeviation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 119.98628 | 900 | 2200 | 20 |\n\nThe column MZ specifies the approximate m/z of the wall background. \nThe column Rtstart specifies the start of the wall in seconds. \nThe column Rtend specifies the end of the wall in seconds. \nThe column MZdevation specifies the approximate m/z deviation of the wall background (approximately the 95% confidence interval). \n\nA random retention time between Rtstart and Rtend will be used. To specifically train PeakBot for certain wall backgrounds narrow retention time windows can be used. \n\nThe format to specify the list of other backgrounds is also a simple tsv file with the following columns:\n| RTStart | RTEnd | MZLow | MZHigh |\n| --- |--- |--- |--- |\n| 200 | 600 | 800 | 1000 |\n\nThe column RTStart specifies the start of the background area in seconds. \nThe column RTEnd specifies the end of the background area in seconds. \nThe column MZLow specifies the lowest m/z of the background area. \nThe column MZHigh specifies the largest m/z of the background area. \n\nTemplates for these three lists are located in the folder Reference of this manuscript and have the names _template_Peaks.tsv, _template_Walls.tsv, and _template_Backgrounds.tsv. \n\nThe actual values of the reference features and backgrounds in the different reference chromatograms are automatically calculated using a gradient-descend appraoch. Thus, these determined reference feature values can vary from chromatogram to chromatogram. However, care must be taken that no co-eluting compounds (isomers) are present. \n\nPeakBot in general has no difficult data processing parameters. However, the user has to specify the following minimal settings for their chromatograms in order to instruct PeakBot how to train a new model: \n* nosieLevel: signal intensity below which a signal is considered to represent noise.\n* minIntensity: minimum intensity of signals to be used as a local maximum seed.\n* minRT: all scans earlier than this retention time will not be used by PeakBot (e.g. waste).\n* maxRT: all scans later than this retention time will not be used by PeakBot (e.g. column reconditioning).\n* RTpeakWidth: minimum and maximum peak with of a chromatographic peak (list of minimum and maximum value) used by the gradient-descend algorithm.\n* intraScanMaxAdjacentSignalDifferencePPM: the ppm difference between profile mode signals belonging to the same feautre. Here the highest m/z differences should be used.\n* interScanMaxSimilarSignalDifferencePPM: the ppm difference between signals of different scans representing the same profile mode signal.\nThe two parameters intraScanMaxAdjacentSignalDifferencePPM and interScanMaxSimilarSignalDifferencePPM are a bit difficult to evaluate, but can in general be used with the same values. It can be done with any software that visualized LC-HRMS chromatograms. In this respect TOPPView from the OpenMS toolbox (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19425593/) can be used as it allows the user to easily calculate the m/z difference in ppm when selecting two signals and pressing the shift key. Alternatively, PeakBot offers a function to estimate these values automatically (see script estimateParameters.py). \n\nThe following figure illustrates the different reference feature values and LC-HRMS settings. \n![illustration of PeakBot settings](https://github.com/christophuv/PeakBot_Example/raw/main/Parameters.png)\n\n\n"
