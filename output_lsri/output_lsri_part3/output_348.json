        "value": "Networks are vital tools for understanding and modeling interactions in complex \nsystems in science and engineering, and direct and indirect interactions are \npervasive in all types of networks. However, quantitatively disentangling direct \nand indirect relationships in networks remains a formidable task. Here, we \npresent a framework, called iDIRECT (Inference of Direct and Indirect \nRelationships with Effective Copula-based Transitivity), for quantitatively \ninferring direct dependencies in association networks. Using copula-based \ntransitivity, iDIRECT eliminates/ameliorates several challenging mathematical \nproblems, including ill-conditioning, selflooping, and interaction strength \noverflow. \nWith simulation data as benchmark examples, iDIRECT showed high prediction \naccuracies. Application of iDIRECT to reconstruct gene regulatory networks in \n*Escherichia coli* also revealed considerably higher prediction power than the \nbestperforming approaches in the DREAM5 (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering \nAssessment and Methods project, #5) Network Inference Challenge. In addition, \napplying iDIRECT to highly diverse grassland soil microbial communities in \nresponse to climate warming showed that the iDIRECT-processed networks were \nsignificantly different from the original networks, with considerably fewer \nnodes, links, and connectivity, but higher relative modularity. Further analysis \nrevealed that the iDIRECT-processed network was more complex under warming than \nthe control and more robust to both random and target species removal (*P* < \n0.001). \nAs a general approach, iDIRECT has great advantages for network inference, and \nit should be widely applicable to infer direct relationships in association \nnetworks across diverse disciplines in science and engineering. \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "A deeper cause of this behavior is that I chose to implement iDIRECT for unsigned values only. This is because it is difficult to implement iDIRECT for signed values. Suppose two nodes (A and B) are connected through C and D. If I implement iDIRECT with signed values, and suppose the association of path A-C-B is 0.9 and the association of path A-D-B is -0.9. This is highly unlikely in reality, but it almost certainly happens in practice. The resulting nonlinear S- and T-solvers in iDIRECT will perform poorly in this case. By implementing iDIRECT for unsigned values only, I do not need to deal with this unrealistic but difficult case.\n \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "A: In iDIRECT, direct links are interpreted as those with direct association strengths significantly (P < 0.05) different from background noises. Those background noises are estimated by computing the differences between the observed indirect association strengths and the iDIRECT-predicted indirect association strengths of random links below the RMT-determined cutoff.  \nFor example, consider a dataset with 100 OTUs. The total number of pairwise associations is 4,950. Suppose 500 of them are above the RMT cutoff and count as potential links. Let the corresponding total and direct association strength be $w_i$ and $v_i$ (i=1,2,...,500), respectively. Using $w_i$ and $v_i$ (i=1,2,...,500), I can calculate the indirect association strength for the remaining 4,450 association pairs. Let the corresponding total and indirect association strength be $w_i$ and $u_i$ (i=501,502,...,4950), respectively. The difference $v_i = |w_i \\ominus u_i|$ (i=501,502,...,4950) can be used to estimate the background noise, where $\\ominus$ is the inverse operator defined in Eq. (B2) in the supplement (page 21, above line 419). Then we can use the 5% quantile of $v_i$ (i=501,502,...,4950) as a cutoff, $v_{{th}}$. The top 500 links with $v_i < v_{{th}}$ are discarded, since their direct association strength is much smaller than the background noise. Because $v_{{th}}$ is usually smaller, one may even use $w_i$ instead of $v_i$ (i=501,502,...,4950) when determining $v_{{th}}$ to save computation time.\n \n"

For the avoidance of doubt, where the \n            Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the \n            synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image \n            (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of \n            this License.\n        b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such \n            as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or \n            broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed \n            in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and \n            arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in \n            which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along \n            with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and \n            independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a \n            collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be \n            considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this \n            License.\n        c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and \n            copies of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n        d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that \n            offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n        e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, \n            the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work \n            or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and \n            in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, \n            musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, \n            declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or \n            artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a \n            phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first \n            fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the \n            case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n        f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the \n            terms of this License including without limitation any production in \n            the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the \n            mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a \n            book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or \n            other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; \n            a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical \n            composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which \n            are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to \n            cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, \n            sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which \n            are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to \n            photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, \n            sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, \n            architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a \n            compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable \n            work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the \n            extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n        g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this \n            License who has not previously violated the terms of this License \n            with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission \n            from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a \n            previous violation.\n        h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work \n            and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any \n            means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public \n            digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such \n            a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place \n            and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to \n            the public by any means or process and the communication to the \n            public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital \n            performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means \n            including signs, sounds or images.\n        i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including \n            without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of \n            fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of \n            a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other \n            electronic medium.\n    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, \n        limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from \n        limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the \n        copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, \n        Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, \n        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to \n        exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n        a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more \n            Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the \n            Collections; and,\n        b. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated \n            in Collections.\n        c. For the avoidance of doubt:\n            i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions \n                in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or \n                compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor \n                reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any \n                exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n            ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in \n                which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or \n                compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives \n                the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise \n                by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n            iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to \n                collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that \n                the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that \n                administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from \n                any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known \n        or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such \n        modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in \n        other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make \n        Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted \n        by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made \n        subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n        a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms \n            of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource \n            Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You \n            Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any \n            terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the \n            ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted \n            to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not \n            sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to \n            this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of \n            the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or \n            Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective \n            technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a \n            recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to \n            that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) \n            applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does \n            not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made \n            subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, \n            upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, \n            remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), \n            as requested.\n        b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You \n            must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep \n            intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to \n            the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original \n            Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the \n            Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties \n            (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for \n            attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, \n            terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such \n            party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to \n            the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor \n            specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not \n            refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. \n            The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any \n            reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a \n            Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for \n            all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of \n            these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits \n            for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You \n            may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of \n            attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your \n            rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly \n            assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by \n            the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as \n            appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, \n            express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor \n            and/or Attribution Parties.\n        c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be \n            otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute \n            or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any \n            Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other \n            derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial \n            to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR \n        OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY \n        KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, \n        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, \n        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF \n        LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, \n        WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE \n        EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, \n        IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY \n        SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES \n        ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS \n        BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n    7. Termination\n        a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate \n            automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. \n            Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under \n            this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated \n            provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with \n            those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any \n            termination of this License.\n        b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here \n            is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the \n            Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to \n            release the Work under different license terms or to stop \n            distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such \n            election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other \n            license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms \n            of this License), and this License will continue in full force and \n            effect unless terminated as stated above.\n    8. Miscellaneous\n        a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a \n            Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the \n            Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You \n            under this License.\n        b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under \n            applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability \n            of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further \n            action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be \n            reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision \n            valid and enforceable.\n        c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no \n            breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in \n            writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or \n            consent.\n        d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties \n            with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, \n            agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified \n            here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that \n            may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be \n            modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and \n            You.\n        e. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this \n            License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne \n            Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as \n            amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the \n            WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms \n            Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised \n            on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in \n            the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to \n            be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the \n            implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national \n            law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable \n            copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this \n            License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the \n            License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any \n            rights under applicable law.\n"

        "value": "A: For simple networks with few links, one can provide all links and run iDIRECT as in the demo example `demo.py`. For complex networks with many nodes, keeping all the links is both unnecessary and impractical, because one is not interested in the links with association strength below a certain cutoff threshold and the computation takes too much time. To address this problem, when calling the `direct_association` function from iDIRECT package, one can use the optional argument `th` to ignore links with low association strength. The rationale is that the link between two nodes is most probably caused by random association when their association strength is below a cutoff threshold, and the corresponding direct association strength should be zero. For example, to ignore links with total association strength < 0.6, use\n```\nS,err = idir.direct_association(G, th=0.6)\n```\nThen links with a total association strength < 0.6 will never be in the direct association network `S`. To ignore links whose association strength is not in the top 500, use\n```\nS,err = idir.direct_association(G, th=500)\n```\nThen links with a total association strength below the top 500 will never be in the direct association network `S`.\n"

        "value": "The main functions for iDIRECT is included in the script `idirect.pyc`, with \nauxiliary functions in the scripts `file_handler.pyc` and `net_handler.pyc`. A \ndemonstration script `demo.py` is included as a minimal example.\n\nThe modules can be imported by\n```\nimport idirect as idir\nimport file_handler as fh\nimport net_handler as nh\n```\n\nFor debugging purpose, the program starting time is recorded\n```\nfrom time import time\nt0 = time()\n```\n\nThe observed total association network is read from the file `result/demo.txt` \nas a list of weighted edges\n```\nG,n = fh.read_file_weighted_edges(\"result/demo.txt\", t0)\n```\nThe content of the file `result/demo.txt` is shown below\n```\nN1\tN2\t0.7\nN2\tN3\t0.7\nN1\tN3\t0.5\n```\nThe observed total association network G is saved as a dictionary of \ndictionaries\n```\n>>> G\n{'N1': {'N2': 0.7, 'N3': 0.5}, 'N2': {'N1': 0.7, 'N3': 0.7}, 'N3': {'N2': 0.7, 'N1': 0.5}}\n```\n\nThen iDIRECT is called to calculate the direct association network\n```\nS,err = idir.direct_association(G, t0=t0)\n```\nThe direct association network S is also saved as a dictionary of dictionaries\n```\n>>> S\n{'N1': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.055394034573921835}, 'N2': {'N1': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.6963451220087373}, 'N3': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N1': 0.055394034573921835}}\n```\n\nThe direct association network is merged with the total association network and \nthe edges are extracted as a list of tuples containing the source, target, and \nweight of each edge\n```\nS2 = nh.merge(G, S)\nSt = fh.save_sorted_turple(S2, in_file=\"result/demo.txt\")\n```\nThe purpose is to retain the same number of edges as the original observed total \nnetwork as required by the DREAM5 network inference challenge. For this demo \nexample, it has no effect\n```\n>>> S2\n{'N1': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.055394034573921835}, 'N2': {'N1': 0.6963451220087373, 'N3': 0.6963451220087373}, 'N3': {'N2': 0.6963451220087373, 'N1': 0.055394034573921835}}\n>>> St\n[('N1', 'N2', 0.6963451220087373), ('N2', 'N3', 0.6963451220087373), ('N1', 'N3', 0.055394034573921835)]\n```\n\nFinally, the direct association network is saved in the file \n`result/demo_res.txt`\n```\nfh.save_file_weighted_edges(St, \"result/demo_res.txt\")\n```\nThe content of the output file `result/demo_res.txt` is shown below\n```\nN1\tN2\t0.696345122\nN2\tN3\t0.696345122\nN1\tN3\t0.055394035\n```\n"
