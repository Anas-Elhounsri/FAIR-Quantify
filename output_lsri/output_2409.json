        "value": "Biosaur is quite easy to use. To start your first bioasur search use command:\n```sh\nbiosaur YOUR_FILE.mzML\n```\nThis command will start standart biosaur search with default parameters.\nIf you need to specify parameters use `biosaur --help` to identify the required parameter.\n\nSpecial attention to TIMS TOF data.\n\nFirst of all, the .d files should be converted to mzML format using msconvert with option '--combineIonMobilitySpectra'.\n\n**Please, do not use option `--filter \"scanSumming\"`! The latter is often required for MS/MS data analysis but breaks MS1 feature detection.**\n\nThe best way to deal with it is to use `--combineIonMobilitySpectra` with `--filter \"msLevel 1\"` to create an individual mzML file for Biosaur-only analysis. At the current moment, TIMS TOF data has enormous size of files, as well as a huge amount of peaks, so it is highly recommended to use Biosaur `--min_intensity` option to reduce complexity of the analysis. For example, using `--min_intensity 1000` option requires ~10 Gb of RAM memory and 20 mins of processing time on average PC (Intel i7-3930K CPU) when applied to a complex sample dataset containing 8000 MS1 spectra (`200ng_HeLa_50cm_120min_100ms from PXD010012` on the ProteomeXchange). The same data with `--min_intensity 800` filter requires 40 minutes of processing. The analyis of similar data for Orbitrap HF with no ion mobility info and no restrictions on `--min_intensity` takes ~5-10 min. In general, increasing `--min_intensity` reduces Biosaur analysis time and RAM consumption in non-linear way, but at the same time decreases sensitivity of feature detection.\n"
