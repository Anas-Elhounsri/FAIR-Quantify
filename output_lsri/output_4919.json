If you\u2019re unsure about anything, just ask \u2014 or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we\u2019ll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.\n\nOne of our goals is to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors to our projects. Our staff follows the [18F Code of Conduct](https://18f.gsa.gov/code-of-conduct/), and all contributors should do the same.\n\nWe encourage you to read this project\u2019s CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/develop/LICENSE.md), [README](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/develop/README.md) and its [Workflow](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Workflow) process.\n\nIf you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).\n\n## Guidelines\n\n### Contributor Guidelines for Design\n\nWe have provided some guidelines for folks that would like to submit new components to the U.S. Web Design System and the lifecycle those new components will go through. For more detail, please visit the [guidelines on our wiki](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Contribution-Guidelines:-Design).\n\n### Submitting an issue\n\nTo help us get a better understanding of the issue you\u2019re submitting, follow our ISSUE TEMPLATE and the guidelines it describes.\n\n### Submitting a pull request\n\nHere are a few guidelines to follow when submitting a pull request:\n\n1. Create a GitHub account or sign in to your existing account.\n1. Fork this repo into your GitHub account (or just clone it if you\u2019re an 18F team member). Read more about forking a repo here on GitHub:\n[https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)\n1. Create a branch from `develop` that lightly defines what you\u2019re working on (for example, add-styles).\n1. Ensure that your contribution works via `npm`, if applicable.\n1. Once you\u2019re ready to submit a pull request, fill out the PULL REQUEST template provided.\n1. Submit your pull request against the `develop` branch.\n\n[Open an issue](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new) if you have questions or need help with setup.\n\n### Running locally\n\nThe U.S. Web Design System `uswds` package (the zip download and the\nfiles needed to use the Design System on your project) is built primarily with\ntwo [Node.js] tools: [Fractal] and [Gulp]. Once you've cloned this\nrepository, you'll need to install its dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\n**ProTip**: You can also use [Yarn], which tends to install dependencies more quickly than npm.\n\nTo start the [Fractal] live reload server, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm start\n```\n\nThen, visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a web browser to\nperuse the component library. While the server is running, any changes that\nyou make to the component templates or configurations will reload the page\nautomatically.\n\nIf you're working on the JavaScript or CSS, you can run the \"watch\" task in\nanother shell to automatically rebuild the distribution files that Fractal\nreferences with:\n\n```sh\nnpm run watch\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTo run the component unit tests, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nThis will also run [eslint] and [stylelint] to ensure that the JavaScript\nand SCSS source files meet our coding standards. To lint without the unit\ntests, you'll need [Gulp][]. Install it globally (`npm install -g\ngulp-cli`), then run:\n\n```sh\ngulp eslint\ngulp stylelint\n```\n\n(Or, if you don't want to install Gulp globally, you can run `$(npm\nbin)/gulp` instead of `gulp`.)\n\nNote that running the tests also requires an installation of\nChrome v59 or higher (v60 if you're on Windows).\n\n#### Visual regression testing\n\nThe Design System comes with optional tooling for detecting visual regressions,\nwhich can be especially useful if you're refactoring CSS.\n\nThese tests work by comparing current screenshots of the Design System's Fractal\ncomponents to \"golden\" screenshots that represent what the components are\nsupposed to look like.\n\nGolden screenshots are stored on your local development system *only*;\nthey're not version controlled. This means that after making changes to a branch, \nyou can switch to the branch you'd like to compare it to (e.g. the `develop` \nbranch) to generate your golden screenshots.\n\nTo generate the golden screenshots, run:\n\n```\nnode spec/visual-regression-tester.js test --updateGolden\n```\n\nThen, make any CSS refactorings (or switch to a branch that has them).\n\nTo compare the current state of your CSS to the golden screenshots, run:\n\n```\nnode spec/visual-regression-tester.js test\n```\n\nIf the current screenshots don't match their golden counterparts, you will\nbe directed to an HTML file that visually shows the differences between\nany conflicting screenshots.\n\n### Building\n\nTo build the `uswds` package in preparation for releases, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm run prepublish\n```\n\n## Coding guidelines\n\nThe purpose of our coding styleguides are to create consistent coding practices across 18F. The styleguide should be treated as a guide \u2014 rules can be modified according to project needs.\n\nThis project follows the 18F Front End Guide [CSS](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/#css) and [JavaScript](https://pages.18f.gov/frontend/#javascript). Please use this guide for your reference.\n\n### Code coverage\n\nWe use [code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) tools to understand how much of our JavaScript is tested by our [unit test suite](spec/unit). Code coverage is one way (among many) of measuring code _quality_ more generally. Here's how it works for contributions:\n\n1. Each pull request creates a new coverage report on [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/).\n1. Code Climate then posts a status message back to GitHub that lists the coverage percentage on that branch, and the difference between that number and the one last reported on our default branch.\n\nFor JavaScript contributions, we will review the code coverage percentage and change to ensure that the quality of our code is not dramatically affected.\n\nHigh code coverage numbers are generally good, and we would prefer that our coverage increases over time. We will not categorically reject contributions that reduce code coverage, but we may ask contributors to refactor their code, add new unit tests, or modify existing tests to avoid significant reductions in coverage.\n\n## Browser support\nSee [browser support](https://designsystem.digital.gov/getting-started/developers/#browser-support) in the \u201cGetting started: Developers\u201d guidelines.\n\n## Our use of branches\n\nSee the [release documentation](RELEASE.md#release-process) for more information on our git/GitHub release workflow.\n\n## Licenses and attribution\n\n### A few parts of this project are not in the public domain\n\nFor complete attribution and licensing information for parts of the project that are not in the public domain, see [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/develop/LICENSE.md).\n\n### The rest of this project is in the public domain\n\nThe rest of this project is in the worldwide [public domain](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/blob/develop/LICENSE.md).\n\nThis project is in the public domain within the United States, and\ncopyright and related rights in the work worldwide are waived through\nthe [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n### Contributions will be released into the public domain\n\nAll contributions to this project will be released under the CC0\ndedication.
