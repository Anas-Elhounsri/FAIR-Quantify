        "value": "High-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) tandem mass spectrometry can be coupled to several other analytical techniques such as liquid chromatography (LC) and trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS). LC-TIMS-Q-TOF has gained considerable interest since the introduction of the [Parallel Accumulation\u2013Serial Fragmentation (PASEF)](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.TIR118.000900) method in both data-dependent ([DDA](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00932)) and data-independent acquisition ([DIA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-00998-0)). With this setup, ion intensity values are acquired as a function of the chromatographic retention time, ion mobility, quadrupole mass to charge and TOF mass to charge. As these five-dimensional data points are detected at GHz rates, datasets often contain billions of data points which makes them impractical and slow to access. Raw data are therefore frequently binned for faster data analysis or visualization. In contrast, AlphaTims is a Python package that provides fast accession and visualization of unprocessed raw data. By recognizing that all measurements are ultimately arrival times linked to intensity values, it constructs an efficient set of indices such that raw data can be interpreted as a sparse five-dimensional matrix. On a modern laptop, this indexing takes less than half a minute for raw datasets of more than two billion datapoints. Following this step, interactive visualization of the same dataset can also be done in milliseconds. AlphaTims is freely available, open-source and available on all major Operating Systems. It can be used with a graphical user interface (GUI), a command-line interface (CLI) or as a regular Python package. \n"

More details about individual scans of the frames are available in the `PasefFrameMSMSInfo` (for PASEF acquisition) or `DiaFrameMsMsWindows` (for diaPASEF acquisition) tables. This includes quadrupole and collision settings of the frame/scan combinations. \nThe `analysis.tdf_bin` file is a binary file that contains the number of detected ions per individual scan, all detector arrival times and their intensity values. These values are grouped and compressed per frame (i.e. TIMS cycle), thereby allowing fast appendage during online acquisition.\n \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "AlphaTims first reads relevant metadata from the `analysis.tdf` SQL database and creates a Python object of the `bruker.TimsTOF` class. Next, AlphaTims reads the summary information from the `Frames` table and creates three empty arrays: \n* An empty `tof_indices` array, in which all TOF arrival times of each individual detector hit will be stored. Its size is determined by summing the number of detector hits for all frames.\n* An empty `intensities` array of the same size, in which all intensity values of each individual detector hit will be stored.\n* An empty `tof_indptr` array, that will store the number of detector hits per scan. Its size is equal to `(frame_max_index + 1) * scans_max_index + 1`. It includes one additional frame to compensate for the fact that Bruker arrays are 1-indexed, while Python uses 0-indexing. The final `+1` is because this array will be converted to an offset array, similar to the index pointer array of a [compressed sparse row matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_%28CSR,_CRS_or_Yale_format%29). Typical values are `scans_max_index = 1000` and `frame_max_index = gradient_length_in_seconds * 10`, resulting in approximately `len(tof_indptr) = 10000 * gradient_length_in_seconds`. \n* A `quad_indptr` array that indexes the `tof_indptr` array. Each element points to an index of the `tof_indptr` where the voltage on the quadrupole and collision cell is adjusted. For PASEF acquisitions, this is typically 20 times per MSMS frame (turning on and off a value for 10 precursor selections) and once per change from an MS (precursor) frame to an MSMS (fragment) frame. For diaPASEF, this is typically twice to 10 times per frame and with a repetitive pattern over the frame cycle. This results in an array of approximately `len(quad_indptr) = 100 * gradient_length_in_seconds`. As with the `tof_indptr` array, this array is converted to an offset array with size `+1`.\n* A `quad_low_values` array of `len(quad_indptr) - 1`. This array stores the lower m/z boundary that is selected with the quadrupole. For precursors without quadrupole selection, this value is set to -1.\n* A `quad_high_values` array, similar to `quad_low_values`.\n* A `precursor_indices` array of `len(quad_indptr) - 1`. For PASEF this array stores the index of the selected precursor. For diaPASEF, this array stores the `WindowGroup` of the fragment frame. A value of 0 indicates an MS1 ion (i.e. precursor) without quadrupole selection. \nAfter processing this summarising information from the `analysis.tdf` SQL database, the actual raw data from the `analysis.tdf_bin` binary file is read and stored in the empty `tof_indices`, `intensities` and `tof_indptr` arrays. \nFinally, three arrays are defined that allow quick translation of `frame_`, `scan_` and `tof_indices` to `rt_values`, `mobility_values` and `mz_values` arrays.\n* The `rt_values` array is read read directly from the `Frames` table in `analysis.tdf` and has a length equal to `frame_max_index + 1`. Note that an empty zeroth frame with `rt = 0` is created to make Python's 0-indexing compatible with Bruker's 1-indexing.\n* The `mobility_values` array is defined by using the function `tims_scannum_to_oneoverk0` from `timsdata.dll` on the first frame and typically has a length of `1000`.\n* Similarly, the `mz_values` array is defined by using the function `tims_index_to_mz` from `timsdata.dll` on the first frame. Typically this has a length of `400000`. \nAll these arrays can be loaded into memory, taking up roughly twice as much RAM as the `.d` folder on disk. This increase in RAM memory is mainly due to the compression used in the `analysis.tdf_bin` file. The HDF5 file can also be compressed so that its size is roughly halved and thereby has the same size as the Bruker `.d` folder, but (de)compression reduces accession times by 3-6 fold.\n \n"

This installation allows access to all available features of AlphaTims and even allows to modify its source code directly. Generally, the developer version of AlphaTims outperforms the precompiled versions which makes this the installation of choice for high-throughput experiments.\n* [**Docker:**](#docker) Use this installation if you want to use a container based workflow.

The lightweight version of AlphaTims that purely focuses on data accession (no plotting without additional packages) can be installed with:\n\n```bash\npip install alphatims\n```\n\nInstalling AlphaTims like this avoids conflicts when integrating it in other tools, as this does not enforce strict versioning of dependancies. However, if new versions of dependancies are released, they are not guaranteed to be fully compatible with AlphaTims. While this should only occur in rare cases where dependencies are not backwards compatible, you can always force AlphaTims to use dependancy versions which are known to be compatible with:\n\n```bash\npip install \"alphatims[stable]\"\n```\n\nNOTE: You might need to run `pip install pip==21.0` before installing AlphaTims like this. Also note the double quotes `\"`.\n\nAlternatively, some basic plotting functions can be installed with the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install \"alphatims[plotting]\"\n```\n\nWhile the above command does allow usage of the full GUI, there are some known compatability issues with newer versions of bokeh. As such, it is generally advised to not use loose plotting dependancies and force a stable installation with:\n\n```bash\npip install \"alphatims[plotting-stable]\"\n```\n\nWhen older samples need to be analyzed, it might be essential to install the `legacy` version as well (See also the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section):\n\n```bash\npip install \"alphatims[legacy]\"\n```\n\nWhen a new version of AlphaTims becomes available, the old version can easily be upgraded by running e.g. the command again with an additional `--upgrade` flag:\n\n```bash\npip install \"alphatims[plotting,legacy,stable]\" --upgrade\n```\n\nThe following extra options are available:\n\n* `stable`\n* `plotting`\n* `plotting-stable`\n* `legacy`\n* `legacy-stable`\n* `development`\n* `development-stable`\n\nNOTE: Multiple dependancy packs can be installed by comma-separation.

        "value": "AlphaTims can also be installed in editable (i.e. developer) mode with a few `bash` commands. This allows to fully customize the software and even modify the source code to your specific needs. When an editable Python package is installed, its source code is stored in a transparent location of your choice. While optional, it is advised to first (create and) navigate to e.g. a general software folder:\n\n```bash\nmkdir ~/folder/where/to/install/software\ncd ~/folder/where/to/install/software\n```\n\n***The following commands assume you do not perform any additional `cd` commands anymore***.\n\nNext, download the AlphaTims repository from GitHub either directly or with a `git` command. This creates a new AlphaTims subfolder in your current directory.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/MannLabs/alphatims.git\n```\n\nFor any Python package, it is highly recommended to use a [conda virtual environment](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). The best way to install an editable version of AlphaTims is to use AlphaTims' pre-built conda development environment (note that the `--force` flag overwrites an already existing AlphaTims environment):\n\n```bash\nconda env create --force --name alphatims --file alphatims/misc/conda_development_environment.yaml\nconda activate alphatims\n```\n\nAlternatively, a new conda environment can manually be created or AlphaTims can be installed in an already existing environment. *Note that dependancy conflicts can occur with already existing packages in the latter case*! Once a conda environment is activated, AlphaTims and all its [dependancies](requirements) need to be installed. To take advantage of all features and allow development (with the `-e` flag), this is best done by installing both the [plotting dependencies](requirements/requirements_plotting.txt) and [development dependencies](requirements/requirements_development.txt) instead of only the [core dependencies](requirements/requirements.txt):\n\n```bash\nconda create -n alphatims python=3.8 -y\nconda activate alphatims\npip install -e \"./alphatims[plotting-stable,development]\"\n```\n\n***By using the editable flag `-e`, all modifications to the AlphaTims [source code folder](alphatims) are directly reflected when running AlphaTims. Note that the AlphaTims folder cannot be moved and/or renamed if an editable version is installed.***\n\nThe following steps are optional, but make working with AlphaTims slightly more convenient:\n\n* To avoid calling `conda activate alphatims` and `conda deactivate` every time AlphaTims is used, the binary execution (which still reflects all modifications to the source code) can be added as an alias. On linux and MacOS, this can be done with e.g.:\n  ```bash\n  conda activate alphatims\n  alphatims_bin=\"$(which alphatims)\"\n  echo \"alias alphatims='\"${alphatims_bin}\"'\" >> ~/.bashrc\n  conda deactivate\n  ```\n  When `zsh` is the default terminal instead of `bash`, replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc`. On Windows, the command `where alphatims` can be used to find the location of the binary executable. This path can then be (permanently) added to Windows' path variable.\n* When using Jupyter notebooks and multiple conda environments direcly from the terminal, it is recommended to `conda install nb_conda_kernels` in the conda base environment. Hereafter, running a `jupyter notebook` from the conda base environment should have a `python [conda env: alphatims]` kernel available, in addition to all other conda kernels in which the command `conda install ipykernel` was run.\n"

        "value": "Common installation/usage issues include: \n* **Always make sure you have activated the AlphaTims environment with `conda activate alphatims`.** If this fails, make sure you have installed [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and have created an AlphaTims environment with `conda create -n alphatims python=3.8`.\n* **No `git` command**. Make sure [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed. In a notebook `!conda install git -y` might work.\n* **Wrong Python version.** AlphaTims is only guaranteed to be compatible with Python 3.8. You can check if you have the right version with the command `python --version` (or `!python --version` in a notebook). If not, reinstall the AlphaTims environment with `conda create -n alphatims python=3.8`.\n* **Dependancy conflicts/issues.** Pip changed their dependancy resolver with [pip version 20.3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/). Downgrading or upgrading pip to version 20.2 or 21.0 with `pip install pip==20.2` or `pip install pip==21.0` (before running `pip install alphatims`) could solve dependancy conflicts.\n* **AlphaTims is not found.** Make sure you use the right folder. Local folders are best called by prefixing them with `./` (e.g. `pip install \"./alphatims\"`). On some systems, installation specifically requires (not) to use single quotes `'` around the AlphaTims folder, e.g. `pip install \"./alphatims[plotting-stable,development]\"`.\n* **Modifications to the AlphaTims source code are not reflected.** Make sure you use the `-e` flag when using `pip install -e alphatims`.\n* **Numpy does not work properly.** On Windows, `numpy==1.19.4` has some issues. After installing AlphaTims, downgrade NumPy with `pip install numpy==1.19.3`.\n* **Exporting PNG images with the CLI or Python package might not work out-of-the-box**. If a conda environment is used, this can be fixed by running `conda install -c conda-forge firefox geckodriver` in the AlphaTims conda environment. Alternatively, a file can be exported as html and opened in a browser. From the browser there is a `save as png` button available.\n* **GUI does not open.** In some cases this can be simply because of using an incompatible (default) browser. AlphaTims has been tested with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Windows IE and Windows Edge compatibility is not guaranteed.\n* **When older Bruker files need to be processed as well,** the [legacy dependencies](requirements/requirements_legacy.txt) are also needed. However, note that this requires [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools) to be manually installed (on Windows machines) prior to AlphaTims installation! To include the legacy dependencies, install AlphaTims with `pip install \"alphatims[legacy]\"` or `pip install \"alphatims[legacy]\" --upgrade` if already pre-installed.\n* **When installed through `pip`, the GUI cannot be started.** Make sure you install AlphaTims with `pip install \"alphatims[plotting-stable]\"` to include the GUI with stable dependancies. If this was done and it still fails to run the GUI, a possible fix might be to run `pip install panel==0.10.3` after AlphaTims was installed.\n* **Some external libraries are missing.** On some OS, there might be libraries missing. As an exmaple, the following error message might pop up: `OSError: libgomp.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`. This can be solved by installing those manually, e.g. on Linux: `apt-get install libgomp1`. \n"

Each option can be called with a double dash `--` followed by a long name, while common options also can be called with a single dash `-` followed by their short name. It is indicated what type of parameter is expected, e.g. a `DIRECTORY` for `--output_folder` or nothing for `enable/disable` flags. Defaults are also shown and all parameters will be saved in a log file. Alternatively, all used parameters can be exported with the `--export_parameters` option and the non-required ones can be reused with the `--parameter_file`.\n\n***IMPORTANT: Please refer to the [CLI manual](alphatims/docs/cli_manual.pdf) for detailed instructions on the usage and troubleshooting of the stand-alone AlphaTims CLI.***\n"
