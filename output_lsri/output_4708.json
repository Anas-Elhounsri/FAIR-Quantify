Through the shiny interface, the donor, recipient, and sample allele matrix can be quickly compared through interactive data tables. Overall donor integration percentages are displayed. Additionally, chimerism can be calculated from double donor cord blood transplantation. The data is available for download to help verify the integrity of the data.\n \n"

The initial use after starting the program will take the longest (file menu starts at the hard drive level, longer to navigate), but subsequent inputs will be quick due to the program remembering the previously selected files. \nThe Directory structure is as follows: \n* PatientName/Date/CD3/sdata.txt (for post-transplantation data)\n* PatientName/ddata.txt (for pre-transplantation donor data, single donor)\n* PatientName/rdata.txt (for pre-transplantation recipient data)\n* PatientName/d1data.txt (for pre-transplantation donor 1 data, double donor)\n* PatientName/d2data.txt (for pre-transplantation donor 2 data, double donor)\n\t\nExample: \n    patientID\n    |___>ddata.txt\n    |___>rdata.txt\n    |___>Date\n         |___>cd3\n         |    |___>sdata.txt\n         |___>cd33\n              |___>sdata.txt\n              \n**Rchimerism depends on selection of the folder with \"sdata.txt\", and assumes that the donor and recipient files are located 2 directories above.
