The ims files contains one series, and\nfor simplicity, the structure is generated without a series index in the hierarchy with the following commands::\n\n bioformats2raw  --series 0 --scale-format-string '%2$d/'  Human_Spleen_Panel1.ims Human_Spleen_Panel1.zarr\n bioformats2raw  --series 0 --scale-format-string '%2$d/'  Human_Spleen_Panel2.ims Human_Spleen_Panel2.zarr\n bioformats2raw  --series 0 --scale-format-string '%2$d/'  Human_Spleen_Panel2.ims Human_Spleen_Panel3.zarr\n\nThese images will be registered based on the common \"Hoechst\". The name of the channels are lost in this conversion from\nImaris to OME-NGFF ZARR. Some conversions produce \"omera\" metadata in the ZARR file which contains channel labels, which\ncan be used. When the channel labels are unavailable, the channel index can be used such as the following commands::\n\n python -m sitkibex registration --affine \"Human_Spleen_Panel2.zarr@3\" \"Human_Spleen_Panel1.zarr@2\" tx_p2_to_p1.txt\n python -m sitkibex registration --affine \"Human_Spleen_Panel2.zarr@3\" \"Human_Spleen_Panel3.zarr@4\" tx_p2_to_p3.txt\n\nThe quick 2D visualization can be run similarly to the NRRD example. The OME-NGFF ZARR files are not supported for\nwriting, so the resample command can produce NRRD files as well.\n\n"
