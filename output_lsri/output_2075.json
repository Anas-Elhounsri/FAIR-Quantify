        "description": "**Summary:** 0.14.0 adds ontology-based autosuggestions to the experimental annotation feature, category labeling in the main graph/embedding, and a number of bug fixes and incremental improvements.\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n* The experimental annotations feature is augmented with the ability to autosuggest labels from an ontology.   Ontology is specified from an `.obo` file.   See the `--experimental-annotations-ontology` command line flag.\r\n* Main embedding (graph) display enhanced with the ability to display category names over the center of the constituent cells.  Enabled/disabled by a new UI button in the button bar.\r\n* When launched, cellxgene will inform users when a new version is available on PyPi.org.  This check may be bypassed with the new `--no-upgrade-check` command line option.\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n* Labels / names in the user interface will now display in a sorted order, including embedding names, annotation names, and categorical annotation values.\r\n* Various internal build updates and improvements.\r\n* Fonts needed by the application are now served by the internal web server, rather than relying on internet connectivity.\r\n* Javascript and Python package dependencies updated.\r\n* FAQ link removed from Info menu\r\n* All large histograms will now have a consistent number of bins (PR #1086)\r\n* User-created annotations may now contain additional characters (now allow alphanumeric, plus -_.() and single spaces.  Fixes issue #1113.\r\n* The recent `0.7.*` release of the anndata module is incompatible with cellxgene. This release pins the anndata dependency to 0.6.22post1 (the most recent compatible version).\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n* A significant number of bug fixes to experimental annotations, including #1050, #1057, #1036, #1055 and others.\r\n* Annotation file name, specified by `--experimental-annotations-file`, will now allow file names containing a hyphen.   Fixes issue #1072\r\n* Fixed bug which would cause user-created annotations to lose the (mandatory) `unassigned` category.  Fixes issue #1090\r\n* Various layout and whitespace improvements throughout the app.\r\n* Added missing python `requests` package to requirements.\r\n* Fixed bug that would crash if the user created an annotation name which was the same as another existing annotation name.  Fixes issue #1112\r\n* Ensure that all user-created annotation labels are correctly saved, without transformation, to the annotations CSV file.  There were several labels (eg, 'nan') which would not be saved correctly to the annotations CSV file.  Fixes issue #1111.\r\n* Some sequences of actions caused the `undo` button to behave unpredictably. This is fixed by #1099  \r\n",

        "description": "Summary: this release adds three major features, in addition to a number of bug fixes and other features:\r\n* The location of the H5AD file may be specified as a URL, in addition to the currently supported file path\r\n* Anndata \"backed\" mode is supported via `--backed` command line option\r\n* A new experimental feature: the ability to create new categorical metadata for cells, aka cell annotations.\r\n\r\nAdded\r\n* `cellxgene launch` command now accepts a URL as well as file paths. Example: \"cellxgene launch http://\u2026\" Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and with optional package installations, S3 and GS URLs. (#920)\r\n* New command line option, --backed, will load H5AD file in \"backed\" mode.  This uses less memory, and loads faster.  However, it will dramatically increase the time required to load expression histograms or compute differential expression. This feature is most useful to explore metadata and embeddings for very large datasets, or to load only the embedding and metadata on computers with limited memory.  This mode is diabled by default.\r\n* New command line option, `--about`, provides a means to link out to more information about the dataset. The link provided on the command line will appear in the application info menu, and as a link in the dataset title (upper left, next to logo) (#907)\r\n* New command line option, `--disable-diffexp`, will cause on-demand differential expression (top N gene finding) to be disabled in the application. This is useful when exploring very large datasets, where the differential expression calculation is likely to be extremely slow or unusable due to memory exhaustion. Differential expression is enabled by default.\r\n* Hovering the cursor over a category name will highlight cells in the gene expression scatterplot (previously only highlighted cells in the embedding graph).   (#900)\r\n* [_Experimental feature, may be incomplete or unstable_] Added capability to label cells with new metadata (categorical annotations).  This feature is enabled with the \"--experimental-label-file\" command line option, which requires a CSV file name.  User-created metadata will be saved to this file.  We would love feedback on this feature - please submit via GitHub issues.\r\n\r\nChanged\r\n* Pip install for `prepare` sub-command is now separate from default installation. If you wish to use prepare, install via `pip install cellxgene[prepare]`.   See getting started guide for more info. (#887, #889)\r\n* Improved layout when strings are long.  Will now break/truncate data set title, category name, etc. (#858, #909)\r\n* Improved the formatting for histogram axis labels, better handling of large numbers (#913)\r\n* Significant improvements to the embedding and gene expression plots, including reduction in CPU usage, zoom/pan constraints, a new rendering method designed to highlight meaningful data and improve overall usability/visibility (#893)\r\n* Miscellaneous improvements to documentation and README (#878, #857, #880)\r\n* Python and Javascript package updates, for both security and performance\r\n* Rename \"layout\" to \"embedding\" in the UI (#921)\r\n\r\nFixed\r\n* Category-specific mini histograms were computed incorrectly in some cases (#869)\r\n* Remove pinned matplotlib version, and resolve incompatibility by installing scanpy earlier in the dependency list (so it specifies the matplotlib dependency).\r\n* H5py dependency pinned to 2.9.0 to temporarily work around regression reading older anndata files (scanpy issue #832).  This will be removed in a future release.  (#916).\r\n* Fixed several bugs in gene adding (both in bulk and autosuggest).\r\nImproved performance for datasets with a very large number of continuous metadata fields.\r\n",

        "description": "Added\r\n* Switch between multiple embedding visualizations in the UI (eg, tsne, umap, etc). (#776, #766)\r\n* To add guardrails around very large datasets, CLI will generate a warning if a large sparse non-CSC dataset loaded. (#723)\r\n* If a specific port is chosen on the CLI (--port), the app will use it and fail if not able to do so.  If no port is specified, the application will scan for an unused port number (#698, #761)\r\n* Add logo to UI (#782)\r\n\r\nChanged\r\n* Python anndata version dependency updated to >= 0.6.20, resolving the incompatibility with the most recent SciPy release (see anndata issue #146 for details).  Also removed the temporary work-around on scipy version requirements introduced in 0.9.3. \r\n* Updated most javascript package dependencies (#765)\r\n* Use anndata to read h5ad files in `launch`, rather than the ScanPy API wrapper around AnnData.  Improves startup speed.  (#763)\r\n* Layout of embedding visualization improved.  All points will display upon load, and scaling behavior is improved when the window size changes. (#655, #768, #776, #789)\r\n* Pan/zoom scaling is now 1:1 (#722)\r\n* Various testing & CI framework improvements (#777, #772, #757)\r\n* CLI --debug option will generate an error if used with --port option.  If you just want verbose error logging, try --verbose.\r\n\r\nFixed\r\n* Fixed several bugs relating to categorical metadata with large (>100) number of categories. (#764, #781, #721, #737)\r\n* Undo/redo bug fix (#787)\r\n* Correctly handle datasets which use a column name \"name\" in `var` or `obs` metadata. (#785)\r\n",
