Those additional metrics can be selected on \"Expert\"-Tab\r\n\u2022\tTo allow addition of more metrics, \u201c.compile\u201d was removed from each model in model_zoo.py. Compilation is now always done by AIDeveloper, considering user-specific metrics. AIDeveloper always compiles using: loss='categorical_crossentropy' and optimizer='adam'. (So far this used to be a good choice for all image classification jobs. I you need freedom to change these parameters, let me know (maik.herbig@tu-dresden.de or on GitHub -> Issues).\r\n\u2022\tDrag'n drop table on Build-Tab : When clicking the header (at T,V or shuffle), all items are checked/unchecked\r\n\u2022\tAdded SplashScreen (image showing at Program start-up)\r\n\u2022\tPrint in console which device is used when AID is started (useful when using AID from script together with NVIDIA GPU)\r\n",
