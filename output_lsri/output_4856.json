        "value": "Missense variant interpretation is challenging. Essential regions for protein function are conserved among gene family members, and genetic variants within these regions are potentially more likely to confer risk to disease. Here, we generated 2,871 gene family protein sequence alignments involving 9,990 genes and performed missense variant burden analyses to identify novel essential protein regions. We mapped 2,219,811 variants from the general population into these alignments and compared their distribution with 76,153 missense variants from patients. With this gene family approach, we identified 465 regions enriched for patient variants spanning 41,463 amino acids in 1,252 genes. These regions were identified as Pathogenic variant Enriched Regions (PERs). Our entire set of results are available at the PER viewer (http://per.broadinstitute.org/) where the user can explore PERs across genes and gene families. Here we provide additional files associated to the study and the source code used to call PERs from a single gene family alignment. \n"
