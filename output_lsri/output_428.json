You should install them through the instructions on their website. Server codes are not mandatory to be installed. BrainQuake group provides a public server to do the reconstruction and registration works for users. The client package and its Python dependencies can be installed and run with the following\uff1a\n\n    git clone https://github.com/HongLabTHU/BrainQuake.git\n    cd BrainQuake\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    cd BrainQuake\n    python client_main.py\n\n**Note!!!** Installation using pip may face a problem of dependency package version conflict! The newest 'mayavi' version has a conflict with the newest 'vtk' package, so in requirement.txt we define the downloading versions to be 'vtk==8.1.2' and 'mayavi==4.6.2'. If you have installed a later version of mayavi or vtk before, please notice the version changing issue. For now, matplotlib version should be fixed to 3.4.3.\n\nWe **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** a one-stop installation option that you use anaconda to create a virtual environment for all those packages and dependencies. After installing [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads), run the following: (python>=3.6 will all be fine.)\n\n    conda create -n bq_env -c conda-forge python=3.7 numpy scipy matplotlib=3.4.3 nb_conda vtk mayavi=4.6.2 mne nibabel scikit-learn\n    \nWith this conda virtual environment (venv) 'bq_env' created, BrainQuake main window can pop up by running:\n\n    conda activate bq_env\n    cd <directory>/BrainQuake/BrainQuake\n    python client_main.py\n"
