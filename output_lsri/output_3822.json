Leveraging the growing repository of labeled datasets and transferring labels from existing datasets to newly generated datasets will empower the exploration of the single-cell omics. The current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the intrinsic heterogeneity among cell populations and extrinsic differences between datasets. Here, we present a robust graph artificial intelligence model, single-cell Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN), to achieve effective knowledge transfer across disparate datasets. Benchmarked with other label transfer methods on different single cell omics datasets, scGCN has consistently demonstrated superior accuracy on leveraging cells from different tissues, platforms, and species, as well as cells profiled at different molecular layers. scGCN is implemented as an integrated workflow and provided here. \n \n"
