A more detailed description of the DYNAMITE algorithm and its applications can be found at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.21.427647v1. Since the release of this article, we have added a time component to the algorithm, allowing the user to restrain the inclusion of individuals in clusters based on a specified serial interval. This serial interval is defined as the period of time between a primary case-patient (infector) with symptom onset and a secondary case-patient, which has been observed to be 5-6 days for SARS-CoV-2 Rai et al., 2021. Direct transmission chains are intuitively represented by individuals separated by both minimal genetic evolution and time difference within this serial interval.\n\n**This project is still in beta and as such may contain major bugs and we do not guarantee proper results/functionality**\n"

Support values can be provided by any (single) method - i.e., combined result of 2 or more methods will not be accepted. These values can be scaled from 0-1 or 0-100.\n\nAdditionally, a metadata file with sequence IDs, sampling dates, and traits of interest is required. Column headers are needed and must contain the strings \"ID\" and \"Date\" (specific case format not required). Date information must be consistently either numeric or Date format. Remaining columns can consist of any number of traits of interest.\n\nIt is important to note that large trees (>30,000 sequences) cannot be scaled in time using the current implementation of treedater. While we have supplied a the least-squares dating function from Rlsd2 as an alternative, this function is also not entirely scaleable for large datasets. DYNAMITE has been successful with datasets of up to 10,000 sequences, though we are continuing to search for improved options for larger datasets.\n"
