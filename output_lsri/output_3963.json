        "value": "=========\nRNAlign2D\n=========\nRNAlign2D is a Python wrapper allowing one to align multiple RNA molecules using\ninformation about secondary structure and sequence.\nFor this purpose MUSCLE program is used, but one can adjust it\nto use any other multiple sequence alignment tool. \nThis tool firstly remove common RNA modifications, then convert RNA sequences\nand secondary structures to pseudo-amino acid sequences (please not mistake for\ntranslation process - that is only technical solution), and use MUSCLE to\nalign pseudo-amino acid sequences. Finally process is reverted and alignment\nwith original sequence and secondary structure is restored. \n==================\nDot bracket format\n==================\nFormat, where paired residues as marked as brackets () and unpaired residues\nare marked as dots.\nFor example simple structure containing hairpin\n(stem of 5 residues length, loop of 6 residues length)\nmay look like:\n........(((((......)))))......... \nFor pseudoknots [] brackets are used. For higher level pseudoknots {}, <>\nor even Aa, Bb, Cc ... pairs are used. For the RNAlign2D maximum pseudoknots\nlevel taken into account is Bb. \n======================\nInput and output files\n======================\nInput and output files are modified FASTA format.\nFor each sequence in the file:\n* First line contain > character and then optional name\n* Second line (or multiple lines) contain sequence\n* Third line (or multiple lines) contain structure\nSequence and structure are distinguished on the basis of dot and bracket\ncontent. If there is no secondary structure, linear - unpaired structure\nis assumed.\nIf there is Vienna RNA package installed, this package would automatically\ngenerate missing secondary structures. \nSequence may contain modified nucleotides - these modifications\nof nucleotide residues are removed (for example B - 2\u2032-O-methylcytidine\nis converted to C - cytidine), and after the alignment they are restored back\nto the original state. RNAlign2D uses modifications abbreviations from\nMODOMICS database.\nSecondary structure may contain higher level pseudoknots, but for the *simple*\nmode only fist level - [] pseudoknots are treated differently, and for the\n*pseudo* mode only pseudoknots up to level Bb. \nMode *simple* is used in most cases, when there are no pseudoknots or\nthere are only first level pseudoknots. It uses both sequence and secondary\nstructure into account. Higher level pseudoknots are treated as\nunpaired regions.\nMode *pseudo* on the other hand uses only secondary structure, as it allows to\nalign higher level pseudoknots. In some cases mode simple may give better\nresults than mode pseudo even for sequences.\nIn case of the mode *pseudo* there is a need to explicitly show matrix dedicated\nfor *pseudo* alignment, otherwise results may not reflect anything. \n- *-i* option - input file\n- *-o* option - output file\n- *-matrix* option - file with custom matrix or default matrix for pseudoknots (data/pseudo_matrix in the project)\n- *-mode* option - allow to select one of the modes: *simple* or *pseudo*, default *simple*, please remember to use proper matrix for given mode\n- *-gapopen* option - allow to select gap opening penalty for sequence alignment\n- *-gapextend* option - allow to select gap extending penalty for sequence alignment \n=============\nCustom matrix\n=============\nOne can define matrix for himself. As it is simply text file, there is nothing\nthat cannot be done manually. Hovewer there is script create_matrix, that can\nfacilitate that process. \n* Most probably the strongest score should be given to the same type of\n  brackets like ( and ( or [ and [, default value is 7, option: *-same*\n* Probably the smallest score should be given to the oposite brackets like\n  ( and ), default value is -10, option *-reverse*\n* Sometimes there is a bulge in the RNA structure or the loop is bigger by one\n  pair of residues, therefore situation like ( and . should be given small\n  negative value, default value is -1, option *-bracket-dot*\n* In the situation that in one structure there is pseudoknot and in the other\n  there is classical Watson-Crick base pair for example ( and [, there should\n  be given small positive or negative score, default value is 2, option *-other*\n* In case of two unpaired regions . and . there should be positive score, but\n  we suggest it to be small, as loops are probably the best place to introduce\n  gaps, default value is 3, option *-dot_dot*\n* For the *simple* mode there is also possibility to add score for matching\n  nucleotide residues in the sequence. Depending on how important the\n  sequence is, this value may vary, default value is 1, option *-seq_match_add*\n* In case of *pseudo* mode you need to define mode (options are *simple* and\n  *pseudo*), default value is *simple*, option *-mode*\n* Output name could be defined using *-o* option \nFiles are created using data from T-psi-C-database_tpsic.igcz.poznan.pl \n=====\nOTHER\n=====\nIn case of WARNING:\n``*** WARNING *** Matrix is not symmetrical, \ufffd->\ufffd=-10, \ufffd->\ufffd=0``\nmost probably there is no problem at all,\nbut if it is your custom matrix, you can check it to ensure it contain desired\ndata \n========\nCITATION\n========\nIf you are using our software in your research - cite us:\nTomasz Wo\u017aniak, Ma\u0142gorzata Sajek, Jadwiga Jaruzelska, Marcin Piotr Sajek; RNAlign2D: a rapid method for combined RNA structure and sequence-based alignment using a pseudo-amino acid substitution matrix; BMC Bioinformatics. 2021 Oct 16;22(1):504. doi: 10.1186/s12859-021-04426-8.\n \n"
