The most widely-used tools enable genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.\n\nWhile each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted by combining multiple bedtools operations on the UNIX command line.\n"

As you can see in the plots below, the speed and memory consumption scale nicely\nwith sorted data as compared to the poor scaling for unsorted data. The current version of bedtools intersect is as fast as (or slightly faster) than the ``bedops`` package's ``bedmap`` which uses a similar algorithm for sorted data.  The plots below represent counting the number of intersecting alignments from exome capture BAM files against CCDS exons.\nThe alignments have been converted to BED to facilitate comparisons to ``bedops``. We compare to the bedmap ``--ec`` option because similar error checking is enforced by ``bedtools``. \n\n**Note:** bedtools could not complete when using 100 million alignments and the R-Tree algorithm used for unsorted data. \n"

It turns our that these tasks consume a large proportion of run time, especially as input files increase in size. These changes result in a 2-3X improvement in speed, depending on input types, options, etc.\r\n2. Thanks to John Marshall (github: @jmarshall), who improved the stability and cleanliness of the code used for random number generation. These changes also squash a bug that arises on Debian systems.\r\n3. John Marshall cleaned up some lingering data type problems in the `slop` tool.\r\n4. Thanks to @gringer for adding the `-ignoreD` option to the `genomecov` tool, which allows `D` CIGAR operations to be ignored when calculating coverage. This is useful for long-read technologies with high INDEL error rates.\r\n5. Added a fix for a [bug](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/issues/865) that did not properly handle the splitting of intervals in BED12 records with one block.\r\n6. Thanks to John Marshall (github: @jmarshall), we have addressed numerical instability issues in the `fisher` tool.\r\n7. Thanks to Hao Hou (github: @38), reference genomes can be read as an environment variable (`CRAM_REFERENCE`) when using CRAM input files.\r\n8. Added a `-rna` option to the `getfasta` tool to allow support for RNA genomes.\r\n9. Thanks to Hao Hou (github: @38), we fixed input file format detection bugs arising in ZSH.\r\n10. Thanks to Josh Shapiro (github:@jashapiro) for clarifying a confusing inconsistency in the documentation for the `coverage` tool.\r\n11. Thanks to Hao Hou (github: @38), we suppressed unnecessary warnings when reading GZIPP'ed files.\r\n12. Thanks to Hao Hou (github: @38), we fixed an overflow bug in the `shuffle` tool.\r\n13. Thanks to Hao Hou (github: @38), we fixed an data type bug in the `shift` tool.\r\n14.

The resolution for issue 750 in version 2.29.0 mistakenly allowed for fractional overlap to be counted based upon redundant overlap.\r\n- Moved to Github Continuous Integration for automatic testing.\r\n- Fixed a bug that injected erroneous quality values with BAM records had no valid quality values.\r\n- Fixed a bug that destroyed backwards compatibility in the getfasta tool. Thanks to Torsten Seeman for reporting this.\r\n- Fixed a corner case bug in the reldist tool.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the bedtobam tool that caused the last character in read names to be removed.\r\n- Fixed a bug causing a segfault in the jaccard tool.\r\n- Fixed a bug causing a corner case issue in the way coordinates are reported in the flank tool.",

        "description": "1. The `coverage` tool now takes advantage of pre-sorted intervals via the `-sorted` option. This allows the `coverage` tool to be much faster, \n   use far less memory, and report coverage for intervals in their original order in the input file.\n2. We have changed the behavior of the `coverage` tool such that it is consistent with the other tools. Specifically, coverage is now \n   computed for the intervals in the A file based on the overlaps with the B file, rather than vice versa.\n3. The `subtract` tool now supports pre-sorted data via the `-sorted` option and is therefore much faster and scalable.\n4. The `-nonamecheck` option provides greater tolerance for chromosome labeling when using the `-sorted` option.\n5. Support for multiple SVLEN tags in VCF format, and fixed a bug that failed to process SVLEN tags coming at the end of a VCF INFO field.\n6. Support for reverse complementing IUPAC codes in the `getfasta` tool.\n7. Provided greater flexibility for \"BED+\" files, where the first 3 columns are chrom, start, and end, and the remaining columns are free-form.\n8. We now detect stale FAI files and recreate an index thanks to a fix from @gtamazian.\n9. New feature from Pierre Lindenbaum allowing the `sort` tool to sort files based on the chromosome order in a `faidx` file.\n10. Eliminated multiple compilation warnings thanks to John Marshall.\n11.

The closest tool now requires sorted input, but it is between 10 and 60 times faster depending on the use case.\n\nAs an example:\n\n```\n\u279c  cat mq1.bed\nchr1    80  100 q1  1   +\n\n\u279c  cat mdb1.bed\nchr1    5   15  d1.1    1   +\nchr1    20  60  d1.2    2   -\nchr1    200 220 d1.3    3   -\n\n\u279c  cat mdb2.bed\nchr1    15  35  db2.1   1   -\nchr1    120 170 db2.2   2   -\nchr1    210 230 db3 3   +\n\n\u279c  cat mdb3.bed\nchr1    70  90  d3.1    3   -\n```\n\nFind the closest interval in _each_ B file.\n\n```\n\u279c  bedtools closest -a mq1.bed \\\n          -b mdb1.bed mdb2.bed mdb3.bed \\\n          -names foo bar biz\nchr1    80  100 q1  1   +   foo chr1    20  60  d1.2    2   -\nchr1    80  100 q1  1   +   bar chr1    120 170 db2.2   2   -\nchr1    80  100 q1  1   +   biz chr1    70  90  d3.1    3   -\n```\n\nFind the closest interval among _all_ B files.\n\n```\n\u279c  bedtools closest -a mq1.bed \\\n         -b mdb1.bed mdb2.bed mdb3.bed \\\n         -names foo bar biz \\\n         -mdb all\nchr1    80  100 q1  1   +   biz chr1    70  90  d3.1    3   -\n```\n1. Support for IMPRECISE SVs in VCF format.\n2. Added the `-prec` option to grouby to allow control over the reported decimal precision\n\n# Bug fixes\n1. Fixed a bug with zero length records.\n2. Fixed a precision bug in the `fisher` tool. Thanks to @brentp \n3. Fixed a bug in the bamtofastq tool.  Thanks to @ryan-williams  \n",

The `jaccard` tool is now ~3 times faster.\n   - It now supports the `-split` option.\n   - It now supports the `-s` option.\n   - It now supports the `-S` option.\n4. We have fixed several CLANG compiler issues.Thanks to John Marshall for the thorough report.\n5. We added support for \u201cX\u201d and \u201c=\u201d CIGAR operators. Thanks to Pierre Lindenbaum.\n6. Fixed bugs for empty files.\n7. Improved the `-incl` option in the shuffle tool such that the distibution is much more random.\n8. Fixed a bug in slop when very large slop values are used.\n",
