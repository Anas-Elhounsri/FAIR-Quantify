These are expressed as colours: red for an increase, blue for a decrease, and grey for no\nchange. See the paper for full details: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz584\n \n"

In other words, a posterior probability of differential expression (PPDE) is needed instead of the more common p-value.\nYou also need a metabolic network of the organism under study. You can read an SBML-file (.xml) using the COBRA-function\n\"readSBML\" or you can download a Matlab-structure containing a COBRA model directly if one is available.\n\nCOBRA Toolbox needs to be in the Matlab path.\n\nA MILP-solver needs to be set for COBRA.\n\nThe file \"example.m\" is a Matlab script that contains an example pipeline. It can be run with simply \"example\". Note that the script will clear your Matlab workspace.\n\nThe E.coli core network used in the example was obtained from\nhttp://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/Downloads/EcoliCore\n"
