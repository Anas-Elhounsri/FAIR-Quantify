Before developing DAPT, there were several problems the ECM team in Dr. Paul Macklin's research lab identified.  First, it was difficult to manage a large number of parameter sets with a large number of parameters.  Second, it would be nice to use Google Sheets to run the parameters for easier collaboration and management.  Third, only one person in the group would be running all the parameters, making their computer useless for the duration of the runs.  Finally, we needed to upload the data to Box for permanent storage and to allow the rest of the team to view the data.   \nDAPT was written to solve these problems.  A \"database\" (CSV or Google Sheet) is used to store a list of parameter sets.  This database is managed by the `Param` class and provides methods to interact with and manage parameter sets.  the `Box` class allows data to be uploaded to [Box.com](https://box.com).  Sensitive API credentials can be stored in a config file (via the `Config` class) which can also be accessed by users to get other variables. \nFuture versions of the project will work to improve documentation, add examples, cleanup current functionality and add more features.  While most of the `dapt` module is documented, the intended way of using each method is not clearly explained.  There are examples given for the main features, however, again there is not a satisfactory amount of documentation.  Some of the exciting new features to come will be notification and logging integration.  For example, we would like to add Slack notification so teams can be notified if there is an error with a test. \n"

To do so type:\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install dapt\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then test to make sure everything installed by starting a python session and then running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import dapt\r\n>>> dapt.__version__\r\n0.9.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Added support for Google Drive.\r\n* Created database (`db`) and storage packages and placed corresponding code inside them.\r\n* Created base classes for database and storage.\r\n* Worked on `Config` class by making it behave like a dictionary, instead of interacting with it via methods.\r\n* Improved documentation.\r\n\r\n## Backwards compatibility issues\r\n\r\nThis version of DAPT looks very different from previous versions.  Previous versions of DAPT will likely not work with this new release.  Pip version 0.9.1.4 is generally compatible with version v0.9.2.\r\n\r\n## Upcoming changes\r\n\r\nThe next version of DAPT will focus on increasing documentation, consistency, and usability of DAPT.  Version 0.9.5 will focus on adding more APIs to the database and storage package.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the [change log](changes.md) will be used more to allow for better release notes to be generated.\r\n",

Documentation is performed using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).  The [docs](/docs) folder holds all of the resources to document the code.  If you're not familiar with Sphinx you can read this [Medium tutorial](https://medium.com/@eikonomega/getting-started-with-sphinx-autodoc-part-1-2cebbbca5365) for an introduction.

Some of the features we plan to add are:\r\n* Improve documentation of the `dapt` module i\r\n* Add more examples and document current examples better\r\n* Add error and information logging\r\n* Add email and Slack notification",
