Therefore, e.g. CSV\ninput-files need to contain a `\"smiles\"` or `\"inchi\"` which is then used to calculate the fingerprints. There is an\nexample CSV file in the `tests/directory` directory and when you're training using the DFPL package, it will load the\ninput files and add fingerprints. You can test the conversion\n\n```python\nimport dfpl.fingerprint as fp\n\nfp.importDataFile(\"tests/data/smiles.csv\")\n```\n\nIf you're data is in CSV format, has a header row, and contains a `\"smiles\"` or an `\"inchi\"` column, you can use it as\ninput for training as it is. However, if you're data is in a different format, you can use function in the `fingerprint`\nmodule to import it correctly.\n\nThe `tests/data/inchi.tsv` contains data in TSV format without a header row which makes it impossible to identify how to\nimport it automatically. You can use the `import_function` argument to tell `importDataFile` how it can turn your data\ninto a Pandas `DataFrame` that contains, e.g. an `\"inchi\"` column. After that DFPL can calculate and add the\nfingerprints to the `DataFrame`\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport dfpl.fingerprint as fp\n\ndata = fp.importDataFile(\n    \"tests/data/inchi.tsv\",\n    import_function=(lambda f: pd.read_table(f, names=[\"toxid\", \"inchi\", \"key\"]))\n)\n```\n\nYou can store the converted data as a \"pickle\" file which is a binary representation of the Pandas dataframe and can be\nused directly as input file for the DFPL program. The advantage is that the fingerprint calculation needs to be done\nonly once and loading these files is fast.\n\n```python\ndata.to_pickle(\"output/path/file.pkl\")\n```\n\nNote that the file-extension needs to be `\"pkl\"` to be identified correctly by DFPL. Also, you might want to look at\nthe `convert_all` function in the `fingerprint` module that we use to convert different data-files all at once.\n"
