Please follow the instruction on https://docs.docker.com/installation/\n\nAfter the successful installation, all what you need to do is:\n\n``docker run -d -p 8080:80 glogobyte/mirgalaxy``\n\nDocker images are \"read-only\", all your changes inside one session will be lost after restart. This mode is useful to present Galaxy to your colleagues or to run workshops with it. To install Tool Shed repositories or to save your data you need to export the calculated data to the host computer.\n\nFortunately, this is as easy as:\n\n``docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/ glogobyte/mirgalaxy``\n\nWith the additional ``-v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/`` parameter, docker will mount the folder ``/home/user/galaxy_storage`` into the Container under ``/export/``. A ``startup.sh`` script, that is usually starting Apache, PostgreSQL and Galaxy, will recognize the export directory with one of the following outcomes:\n\n  - In case of an empty ``/export/`` directory, it will move the [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database, the Galaxy database directory, Shed Tools and Tool Dependencies and various config scripts to /export/ and symlink back to the original location.\n  - In case of a non-empty ``/export/``, for example if you continue a previouse session within the same folder, nothing will be moved, but the symlinks will be created.\n\nThis enables you to have different export folders for different sessions - means real separation of your different projects.\n\n\nBy default, Galaxy instances launched with this image will have on-demand access to approximately 3TB of\nreference genomes and indexes. These are the same reference data available on the main Galaxy server.\nThis is achieved by connecting to Galaxy's CernVM filesystem (CVMFS) at `data.galaxyproject.org` repository,\nwhich is geographically distributed among numerous servers.\nThe CVMFS capability doesn't add to the size of the Docker image, but when running, CVMFS maintains\na cache to keep the most recently used data on the local disk.\n\n*Note*: If you want to use on-demand the CVMFS reference genomes and indexes, you must launch Docker as `--privileged`\n\n"
