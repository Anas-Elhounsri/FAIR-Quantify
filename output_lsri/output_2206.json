This requires Python version >= 3.7 (so Ubuntu 18.04 users should use `-p python3.8` below):\n```\nvirtualenv -p python3 venv-cactus-v2.9.1\nprintf \"export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:\\$PATH\\nexport PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/lib:\\$PYTHONPATH\\n\" >> venv-cactus-v2.9.1/bin/activate\nsource venv-cactus-v2.9.1/bin/activate\npython3 -m pip install -U setuptools pip wheel\npython3 -m pip install -U .\npython3 -m pip install -U -r ./toil-requirement.txt\n```\n\nSome tools required for `hal2assemblyHub.py`, `cactus-hal2chains` and `cactus-maf2bigmaf` are not included and must be downloaded separately.\nThey are `wigToBigWig faToTwoBit bedToBigBed bigBedToBed axtChain pslPosTarget bedSort hgGcPercent mafToBigMaf hgLoadMafSummary hgLoadChain`.  More information\ncan be found [here](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/).  Note that some may require\na license for commercial use.  Static binaries are not available, but the following command\nshould set them up successfully on many 64 bit Linux systems:\n```\ncd bin && for i in wigToBigWig faToTwoBit bedToBigBed bigBedToBed axtChain pslPosTarget bedSort hgGcPercent mafToBigMaf hgLoadMafSummary hgLoadChain; do wget -q http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/${i}; chmod +x ${i}; done\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nTo test Cactus, the following will run a tiny sumulated alignment.\n```\ncactus ./jobstore ./examples/evolverMammals.txt ./evolverMammals.hal --realTimeLogging\n``\n"

All binaries, such as `lastz` and `cactus-consolidated` will be run via Docker.  Singularity binaries can be used in place of docker binaries with the `--binariesMode singularity` flag.  Note, you must use Singularity 2.3 - 2.6 or Singularity 3.1.0+. Singularity 3 versions below 3.1.0 are incompatible with cactus (see [issue #55](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/issues/55) and [issue #60](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/issues/60)).\n\nBy default, cactus will use the image corresponding to the latest release when running docker binaries. This is usually okay, but can be overridden with the `CACTUS_DOCKER_ORG` and `CACTUS_DOCKER_TAG` environment variables.  For example, to use GPU release 2.4.4, run `export CACTUS_DOCKER_TAG=v2.4.4-gpu` before running cactus.\n"

This ensures that all outputs (gfa, gbz, vcf etc) have compatible node ids.  Before, only GBZ and downstream graphs were chopped which was too confusing.  Old logic can be re-activated using the config XML though.  \r\n- Fix recent bug where using the `--mgMemory` option would crash `cactus-pangenome`\r\n- (Experimental) `--collapse` option added to pangenome pipeline to incorporate nearby self-alignments, including on the reference path. \r\n- Left shifting VCFs (`bcftools norm -f`) no longer run by default (except on `vcfwave`-normalized outputs), since it can cause conflicts with PanGenie by writing multiple variants at the same location.",

This significantly reduces peak memory consumption when using `--haplo`, especially for big diverse pangenomes.\r\n- Previously, you could not align more than roughly 500 samples with Minigraph-Cactus, no matter how small the input genomes were. This bottleneck has been removed: you can now align as many genomes as your system resources allow. For very small genomes, this could be well into the tens of thousands.\r\n- Two bugs were recently found in `vcfwave`, which can be run with the `--vcfwave` option since v2.8.2. First the `AT` field is wrong in the output. Second, and more seriously, genotypes can be incorrect. The latter seems specific to multiallelic sites (but I'm not sure).  This release now strips `AT` fields (they are not relevant after re-alignment anyway). It also splits multiallelic sites before running `vcfwave` in an attempt to work around the genotyping bug.  \r\n",

RED is more sensitive and orders of magnitude faster than the old lastz masking pipeline. Crucially, it is able to mask regions that would slip by RepeatMasker/WindowMasker/lastz in new T2T ape genomes that would otherwise break Cactus downstream. Tests so far show this change to make Cactus much faster and more robust.  The old lastz pipeline can still be toggled back on in the config.\r\n- Delete many unneeded files that previously collected in the jobstore directory until the end of execution. This was a particular issue in large `cactus-pangenome` runs where the jobstore would creep up to several terabytes for HPRC-sized inputs.\r\n- No longer require manually editing the blast chunksize in the config when running on Slurm (to reduce the number of jobs).  It's now scaled up automatically on slurm environments (by a factor controlled in the config).\r\n- Fix bug introduced in last release where Cactus would not work on AWS/MESOS clusters unless `--defaultMemory` and `--maxMemory` options were specified (and in bytes). \r\n- Update to the latest `taffy` and `vg`\r\n",

It is now used to clamp most large Toil jobs. On single-machine it defaults to system memory. This should prevent errors where Toil requrests more memory than available, halting the pipeline in an un-resumable state.\r\n- Update to latest `taffy` and use newer MAF normalization. This should result in larger blocks and fewer gaps. MAF rows will now be sorted phylogenetically rather than alphabetically\r\n- Better handle `.` characters in genome names during MAF processing. Previously neither duplicate filtering nor bigmaf summary creation could handle dots, but that should be fixed now.\r\n- Duplicate filtering now done automatically in `cactus-maf2bigmaf`. \r\n- Disable support for multifurcations (aka polytomies or internal nodes with more than 2 children) in Progressive Cactus. I'm doing this because I got spooked by a drop in coverage I noticed recently in a 4-child alignment. This regression appears to be linked to the new PAF chaining logic that's been added over the past several months. Until that's resolved, Cactus will exit with an error if it sees degree > 2 in the tree. This behaviour can, however, be overridden in the XML configuration file.  \r\n",

This was previously only possible by running step-by-step and not using `cactus-graphmap-join`.\r\n- Add pangenome tutorial (developed for recent hackathon) to documentation.\r\n- Update to `vg` version [1.53.0](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/releases/tag/v1.53.0). \r\n- Updated local alignment selection criteria. At each internal node of the guide tree Cactus picks a set of pairwise local alignments between the genomes being aligned to construct an initial sequence graph representing the whole genome alignment. This sequence graph is then refined and an ancestral sequence inferred to complete the alignment process for the internal node. The pairwise local alignments are generated with LASTZ (or SegAlign if using the GPU mode). To create a reliable subset of local alignments Cactus employs a chaining process that organizes the pairwise local alignments into pairwise chains of syntenic alignments, using a process akin to the chains and nets procedure used by the UCSC Browser. Previously, each genome being aligned, including both ingroup and outgroup genomes, was used to select a set of primary chains. That is, for each genome sequence non-overlapping chains of pairwise alignments were chosen, each of which could be to any of the other genomes in the set. Only these primary chains were then fed into the Cactus process to construct the sequence graph. This heuristic works reasonably well, in effect it allows each subsequence to choose a sequence in another genome with which it shares a most recent common ancestor. In the new, updated version we tweak this process slightly to avoid rare edge cases. Now each sequence in each ingroup genome picks primary chains only to other ingroup genomes. Thus the set of primary chains for ingroup genomes does not include any outgroup alignments. The outgroup genomes then get to pick primary chains to the ingroups, effectively voting on which parts of the ingroups they are syntenic too. The result of this change is that the outgroups are effectively only used to determine ancestral orderings and do not ever prevent the syntenic portions of two ingroups from aligning together.\r\n",

It also adds some new visualization features to the pangenome pipeline, along with several bugfixes.\r\n\r\n- SLURM support added (via Toil v5.11).  It's important to read the documentation about `--consMemory` and `--indexMemory` when running large alignments.\r\n- [ODGI](https://github.com/pangenome/odgi) now integrated into Cactus.  See `cactus-pangenome` options `--viz, --odgi, --chrom-og` and `--draw` for incorporating it into your output.\r\n- Add `--chop` option to `cactus-pangenome` make sure all output graphs have nodes chopped down to at most `1024bp`. By default, the `.gfa.gz` is unchopped and the `.gbz` is, which can lead to annoying confusion when trying to compare node IDs across different files.\r\n- Fix bug where `_MINIGRAPH_` paths ended up in the `.full` output graphs.\r\n- `vg clip` crash fixed.\r\n- `mash` distance for minigraph order now computed by sample (and not by haplotype).  Fixes issue where, for example, diploid ordering would be dependent on whether assembly has chrX.\r\n- If `--refContigs` is not specified, minigraph-cactus now uses naming in addition to size to try to guess reference contigs.\r\n- `--dupeMode consensus` option added to `cactus-hal2maf` in order to use `maf_stream` to merge multiple rows into consensus rows, which may be the best compromise to get the data into PhyloP or the Browser.\r\n- `halReplaceGenome` patched to fix a regression from late 2022 where updating large alignments could lead to a crash.\r\n- Fix `cactus-update-prepare replace` to print the `halRemoveGenome` command rather than quietly running it on the input.\r\n- `--consMemory` and `--indexMemory` options bugs fixed.\r\n- Fix bug with multiple `--reference` samples; they are now all promoted properly to REFERENCE-sense paths. \r\n",

Genomes that previously required masking with RepeatMasker were able to align with the WindowMasking-based fastas directly from NCBI. \r\n- Update to Toil 5.10.0\r\n- Update to latest Taffy\r\n- Specify memory requirements for all Toil jobs (in Progressive Cactus). Cactus Consolidated memory is estimated conservatively, but can be overridden with `--consMemory`. \r\n",

Its inputs are a list of fasta sequences and sample names and it outputs the pangenome graph and various indexes, vcf, etc. Intermediate outputs are exported at the end of each stage, so low-level commands can be used to repeat or continue the workflow.\r\n- `#` characters in fasta contig names no longer need to be cleaned out with special invocation of `cactus-preprocess` to avoid conflicts with `vg` indexes.  This now happens automatically within the pipeline.\r\n- The lower level pangenome commands are all still supported and documented.  But `cactus-align-batch` is now deprecated.  This means it is removed from the documentation (except when describing older results) and from continuous integration tests, and it will give a warning when used. Users should now just run `cactus-align` instead of `cactus-align-batch` where applicable, using the former's `--batch` option. `cactus-align-batch` was a hack required to scale up before the cactus v2.0 rewrite but used nested Toil workflows and needed to go. \r\n- Documentation updated to focus on the simpler interface\r\n- `GFAffix` updated to fix a rare crash\r\n- `cactus-graphmap-join` (and `cactus-pangenome`) will not fail in the event a VCF indexing error (ex from chromosomes that are too long for `tbi`). Instead it will give a warning and produce no index.\r\n- New `cactus-hal2maf` option `--keepGapCausingDupes` is changed to `--filterGapCausingDupes` and turned off by default. The underlying code has bugs that cause problems on certain datasets, and is not ready to be activated by default.\r\n\r\n",

The latter is on by default to prevent over fragmentation, but can be disabled with `--kepGapCausingDupes`\r\n- Remove `--onlyOrthologs` and `--noDupes` options from `cactus-hal2maf` and replace with the `--dupeMode` option. `--dupeMode single` is now the recommended way of getting at most one row / species.  More information about this added to the documentation.\r\n- `--maxRefNFrac` option added to `cactus-hal2maf` to filter out blocks where the reference sequence is mostly Ns (default to filter out >95% Ns).\r\n- Change abPOA scoring matrix to be more consistent with lastz parameters used by cactus, where `N` bases are penalized when aligned with other characters. Before, they could be aligned to anything. This will hopefully make the above filter less necessary.\r\n- Fix bug where `cactus-blast --restart` would not work.\r\n\r\n",
