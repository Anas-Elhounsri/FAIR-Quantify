        "value": "A commonly asked and important question is how paired-end reads that overlap are treated. If two mates from a paired-end experiment happen to both overlap the same CpG then one could get skewed results if the methylation status is taken from both reads, rather than only one of them (i.e., double counting paired-end reads is a bad idea). MethylDackel was written with this in mind, so by default paired-end reads that overlap will never be double counted. \nIt's useful to note how this is implemented internally, since it relates to the `-p` option. For the sake of an example, suppose you have two mates that overlap a given position. In this example, we'll specify that mate #1 has a base call with a phred score of 20 at that position and that mate #2 has a base all with a phred score of 15. \n 1. If both base calls agree, then the one with the lower score (here, mate #2 with a score of 15) is set to 0. Further, the other read's base score (here, mate #1 with a score of 20) is increased by 20%. Since the `-p` option defaults to 10, it will skip mate #2 and only count read #1.\n 2. If the base calls instead disagree, then the process is more complicated. There are a total of four possibilities for how this could work:\n   1. Mate #1 has a higher phred score and the base call is not an `N`. Then its phred score is decremented by that of the other mate (in the example above, `20-15=5`, so `5` would be the new phred score). The phred score for the mate is then set to 0.\n   2. Mate #2 has a higher phred score and the base call is not an `N`. In that case the same procedure as that above is followed, with the mate #2 phred score decremented and the mate #1 phred score set to 0.\n   3. The mate with the higher phred score has a base call of `N`. In this case, the phred scores for both mates are set to 0.\n   4. The mates have identical phred scores. In this case, the phred scores are both set to 0. \nIt's important to think about the above possibilities in conjunction with the `-p` option. If two mates agree but individually have low quality base calls, they may combine to produce a base call of acceptable quality. Similarly, if the two mates have high quality base calls but these disagree, the result could be a combined base call of low quality (due to the disagreement). This is actually the same prodcedure that `samtools mpileup` uses internally, so if you're familiar with variant calling with `samtools` then the methodology and reasons are identical.\n \n"

MethylDackel tracks the number of non-Gs on the strand opposite of Cs in the reference sequence.

To exclude cases where the `--maxVariantFrac` value is exceeded only due to low coverage, the opposite strand must have a depth of coverage of at least `--minOppositeDepth`.

In practice, however, there are often increases/decreases in observed methylation rate at the ends of reads and/or more global changes. These are termed methylation bias and including such regions in the extracted methylation metrics will result in noisier and less accurate data. For this reason, users are strongly encouraged to make a methylation bias plot. MethylDackel comes with a function for just this purpose: \nThat command will create a methylation bias (mbias for short) plot for each of the strands for which there are valid alignments. The command can take almost all of the same options as `MethylDackel extract`, so if you're interested in looking at only a single region or only CHH and CHG metrics then you can do that (run `MethylDackel mbias -h` for the full list of options). The resulting mbias graphs are in SVG format and can be viewed in most modern web browsers: \nIf you have paired-end data, both reads in the pair will be shown separately, as is the case above. The program will suggest regions for inclusion (\"--OT 2,0,0,98\" above) and mark them on the plot, if applicable. The format of this output is described in `MethylDackel extract -h`. These suggestions should not be accepted blindly; users are strongly encouraged to have a look for themselves and tweak the actual bounds as appropriate. The lines indicate the average methylation percentage at a given position and the shaded regions the 99.9% confidence interval around it. This is useful in gauging how many methylation calls a given position has relative to its neighbors. Note the spike in methylation at the end of read #2 and the corresponding dip at the beginning of read #1. This is common and these regions can be ignored with the suggested trimming bounds. Note also that the numbers refer to the first and last base that should be included during methylation extraction, not the last and first base to ignore!.\n \n"

Thus, to ignore the 5 bases on either end of alignments on the original top (OT) strand, one would specify `--nOT 5,5,5,5`. Thus, it is irrelevant how long each alignment is, the outermost 5 bases will always be ignored. Note that specifying bounds longer than a given alignment (e.g., `--nOT 100,200,300,400` for a pair of 50 base long alignments) will not cause an error.\n \n"

For those needing to change this behaviour, please see the `-F` (`--ignoreFlags`) or `-q` options to both `MethylDackel mbias` and `MethylDackel extract`. \nNote that PCR (but not optical!) duplicates should be included for enrichment-based library preparations, like RRBS. In such cases it is vital to use the `--keepDupes` option! \nReads that do not map to a unique location in the genome may contain methylation information about multiple loci and can add noise to methylation calls. Using `--mappability <bigwig>` eliminates reads that cannot be uniquely placed (note: MapQ alone is insufficient to identify such reads). Specify a bigWig file containing low-mappabilty regions (e.g. [bismap](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hg38/hoffmanMappability/k100.Bismap.MultiTrackMappability.bw)) to use this feature. `--minMappableBases` and `--mappabilityThreshold` can be used to fine-tune filtering.

This is the single biggest annoyance of custom auxiliary tags.\n",

        "value": "The most basic usage of MethylDackel is as follows:\n\n    MethylDackel extract reference_genome.fa alignments.bam\n\nThis will calculate per-base CpG metrics and output them to `alignments_CpG.bedGraph`, which is a standard bedGraph file with column 4 being the number of reads/read pairs with evidence for a methylated C at a given position and column 5 the equivalent for an unmethylated C. An alternate output filename prefix can be specified with the `-o some_new_prefix` option.\n\nBy default, MethylDackel will only calculate metrics for Cytosines in a CpG context, but metrics for those in CHG and CHH contexts are supported as well (see the --CHH and --CHG options). If you would like to ignore Cytosines in CpGs, simply specify --noCpG. Each type of metric is output to a different file. For per-CpG and/or per-CHG rather than per-Cytosine metrics, see \"Per-CpG/CHG metrics\", below.\n\nMethylDackel can filter reads and bases according to MAPQ and Phred score, respectively. The default minimums are MAPQ >= 10 and Phred >= 5, though these can be changed with the -q and -p options. MethylDackel can also account for methylation bias (described below) with the `--OT`, `--OB`, `--CTOT`, and `--CTOB` options.\n\nGiven a bigWig of Bismap mappability data (using the `-M` option), MethylDackel can also filter out reads with a mappability score which is too low to support methylation calling. With default settings, a read would be rejected if less than 15 bases have mappability &ge; 0.01, but this can be configured with the `-t` and `-b` options.\n\nThis mappability data can also be read in from a BBM file. A BBM file (short for \"Binary BisMap\") is a custom compressed version of the data from the bigWig which is used by MethylDackel. It can be read in much faster than a bigWig and takes up less disk space. These files can be created by specifying the `-O` or `-N` options when running MethylDackel extract, and can be read in using the `-B` option (instead of `-M`).\n"
