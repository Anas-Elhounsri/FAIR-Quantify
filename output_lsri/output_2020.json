Using\r\nheuristic methods to select isoforms that are explained by the vast majority of polymerase\r\ndensity at their locus, DENR constructs an empirical model for relative polymerase\r\ndensities in the gene body. The profile is then calculated using a loess fit that maps\r\nposition within the gene on a rescaled [0, 1] range to the observed polymerase density,\r\nnormalized median density in the gene body. Relative positions within the gene body are\r\ncalculated such that regions close to the head and tail of the gene where absolute\r\nposition is important are scaled identically across genes (e.g. head 5kb -> [0, 0.2] and\r\ntail 5kb -> [0.8, 1]), and the midsection of each gene is scaled to fit into the\r\nremaining space on the [0, 1] interval. Short genes are handled specially to just use the\r\napplicable part of the linearly scaled regions. Once this shape profile has been\r\ncalculated it can be used to adjust the isoform models so that they do not assume\r\nuniform polymerase density throughout the gene body.\r\n \n"
