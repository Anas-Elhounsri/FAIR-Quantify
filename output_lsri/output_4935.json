        "value": "The protocol describes how to setup and analyse observation of a co-transcriptional RNA folding network by Systems NMR approach. While most experimental approaches can monitor only a single molecule class or reaction type at a time, Systems NMR permits single-sample dynamic quantification of entire \u201cheterotypic\u201d networks \u2013 involving different reaction and molecule types. It thus provides a deeper systems-level understanding of biological network dynamics by combining the dynamic resolution of biochemical assays and the multiplexing ability of \u201comics\u201d. \nThis particular protocol describes the reconstruction of an 8-reaction co-transcriptional network - with simultaneous monitoring of RNA, metabolite, and proteins in a single sample at the same time. From reactions side, the protocol simultaneously quantifies RNA transcription, RNA folding and RNA-protein interactions (observed both from RNA and from protein side) and few other auxiliary reactions. In addition to fundamental analyses of reaction constants under different conditions, the current applications of this particular reconstruction are: (1) map RNA-binding interfaces on proteins without having to purify/order the RNA; (2) monitor co-transcriptional RNA folding perturbations by proteins and small molecules; (3) monitor RNA-transcription-driven protein phase-separation with the possibility to observe multiple proteins at once, each with residue-level resolution. Not counting the protein and RNA template preparation times, the NMR measurement and data analysis parts take about 1 day each. \n"

Also, a \"growing\" baseline in a crowded region may lead to apparent narrowing of linewidth with reaction time, because the current fitting routine assumes baseline fixed at zero intensity. This effect can be factored out, if appropriate baseline correction is found.

In Matlab: **adjust the fitting routine** `v01/a_fit.m` to match the observables / data / constants used in the new network model. Key things which need to be checked:\n   - Order/number of data vectors used for fitting (needs to match the observables in mdf file) - check `obs_data_to_keep` variable;\n   - If added new observables/reactions: check if model initial params (NDP, Prot(s) conc, ..) are set correctly\n   - If added new constants/params: check their init values in the `a_fit.m`, file and/or exclude from optimization. And potentially add their normalization and saving into the output of model fit results. \n**Note**: In the used here implementation BioNetGen cannot provide arbitrary rate laws and algebraic constants for scaling. If want such things included - need to specify them in the final `*.mdf` file used for fitting - similar to what we do for RNA length definition. Alternatively one can switch to e.g. [PottersWheel](https://potterswheel.de/) software which provides more advanced, up-to-date and fully integrated environment for model definition and optimization, including model optimization in log-space. \n"

(or store the fresh OD600\u22481 preculture at 4\u00baC and start main culture in the morning).\n  - Use baffled flasks, this allows to reach OD600\u22483, giving 4g cells / L culture.\n  - Use 2x antibiotic amount than usual.\n\n  - Elution from column: pre-heat elution buffer + make elution twice (reapplying same eluate).\n  - After isopropanol precipitation centrifuge 1h @ 4000xg, 4\u00baC.\n  - After isopropanol removal, wash the pellet not once, but 3 times with 70% ethanol, each time detaching DNA pellet from the walls by inverting the tube, and then centrifugation. This removes salts which reduce the yield &/or quality of transcription.\n  - Dry the pellet on air for 4-6 hours (overnight also ok).\n  - Dissolve DNA in H2O to ~0.41 \u00b5M concentration (650 \u00b5g/ml for 2.4kb plasmid) - this allows to have sufficiently concentrated DNA in the end (after linearization), to not dilute the final NMR sample too much.\n  - To ensure homogenous dissolution of DNA pellet after drying, perform 3 cycles of: [vortex, incubate 10-20 minutes at 50\u00baC, vortex, freeze at -20\u00baC, thaw]. If pellet did not detach from the wall after first vortex, use the pipet to detach it.\n"

To stabilize the protein more, one can potentially add:\n  - 50 mM L-Arg/L-Glu (this leads to increased broadening of imino signals)\n  - up to ~75 mM NaCl / KCl (salt decreases transcription efficiency)\n  - ~1 mM NTPs - these seem capable to mask RNA-binding interfaces, reducing self-aggregation of protein through those.

T7 RNA Pol gives better yields at pH 8.1, but iminos are observed better at lower pH. During typical transcription reaction (starting with 20mM NTPs), due to release of free xPO4, pH goes down by ~0.2 pH units. The pH change can be monitored from the shift of 31P xPO4 signal and/or shift of 1H Tris signal.\n\n- In case you need larger fraction of sample volume to add diluted protein or other additives, the NTPs, MgCl2 and DNA template components can be pre-lyophilized together.

Add these to your python scripts:\n```\n  180917_INx_blank_1top.cara\n  180917_INx_blank_2bottom.cara\n  inproc2_.py\n  md.py\n  res.py\n  sort_.py\n  zh33.py\n  zim.py\n```\n\n2. Check that `sort.py` script has a listing of all pulseprogram names you used in your data (it needs to know which programs correspond to which type of spectra (1D1H, 1D31P, 2DHN, ...)).\n\n##### Step-by-step procedure (for each run):\n1. **Sort experiments**: `sort.py`. This script sorts data by experiment type, adds rough experiment time to the title, creates cara repository with linked 2DHN spectra and `integr_datasets_31P.txt` file for 31P integration. See script header for details. For auto-generation of cara repository, two fragments of final repository (`180917_INx_blank_1top.cara`, `180917_INx_blank_2bottom.cara`) need to be present in the TopSpin python (`py/user`) directory.\n\n2. For quick visualization / comparison of data in TopSpin - see helper scripts: `res.py` (reading data by giving only parts of dataset name, e.g. res IN01a 2001), `md.py` (overlaying series), `zim.py` and `zh33.py` (zooming on specific regions of spectra).\n\n3. Except for 31P spectra - the phases of 1D1H, 1D1H-iminos and 2DHN spectra need to be determined manually for optimal results. For 1D1H and 2DHN - ideally the common phase for time-resolved series is determined not on the first (time0) spectrum, but on the second (\"time1\") spectrum - after T7 addition. One might want to check the phases of 2DHN and 1D1H time0 spectra then (these might be slightly different from \"time1\" spectra).\n\n4. **Automatically process spectra**: Automated processing of all spectra is done by `inproc2.py` - see its header for details. Rough outline:\n  - Phase 2001 (1D1H), 4001 (2DHN) and the last of the 1D-imino 6xxx spectra. Phases of these spectra will be propagated to all other corresponding spectra. For imino spectrum the last one is used because there are no imino signals in the first one :)\n  - Calibrate the ppm frequency of 2001 spectrum (1D1H) - its SR/SFO value will be used to set correct frequencies of all spectra.\n  - Set desired SI / STSI / STSR values in 4001 (2DHN) spectrum - these will be propagated to all other 2DHN spectra.\n\n5. If using \"manual\" processing:\n  * 1D31P:\n    - `qumulti 5000-5500`\n    - example of processing command (check only SR corrections, in our setup phase seems determined robustly enough by `apks` routine):\n    - `SR -10.1; si 64k; wdw EM; lb 2; efp; apks; absf1 14; absf2 -26; absg 5; absn`\n\n  * 2DHN:\n      - `qumulti 4000-4500`\n      - example of processing command (check phase, SR corrections, STSI/STSR for the dimensions of the final spectrum, etc):\n      - `2 sr -26.41; 1 sr -2.676; 2 phc0 -264.203; 2 phc1 0; 2 si 8k; 1 si 512; 2 STSI 2214; 2 STSR 1512; 1 stsi 0; 1 stsr 0; 2 absf1 11; 2 absf2 5.5; 1 absf1 200; 1 absf2 80; absg 5; xfb n nc_proc 7; abs2; abs1`\n\n6. Integrate: TopSpin `intser` command, pointing to the `integr_datasets_31P.txt` as the list of spectra to integrate (it should be created by `sort.py` in the dataset folder). Use default settings for integration - the calibration of integrals to internal NTP signal happens later during analysis.\n  - Integration regions we use:\n  ```\n  #   3.4714285714285715  1.5571428571428572   -- PO4\n  #   0.42857142857142855  -2.676190476190476  -- PPi\n  #   -4.3238095238095235  -5.352380952380952  -- RNA\n  #   -5.352380952380952  -5.390476190476191   -- gammaNTP\n  #   -5.390476190476191  -5.804761904761905   -- RNA-5'gamma?\n  #   -9.101442036015632  -9.806884238970339   -- betaNDP\n  #   -9.80952380952381  -10.433333333333334   -- alphaNDP\n  #   -10.433333333333334  -11.219047619047618 -- alphaNTP\n  #   -17.60952380952381  -19.052380952380954  -- RNA-5'beta?\n  #   -19.052380952380954  -19.714285714285715 -- betaNTP\n  ```\n\n7. Pick peaks in 2DHN spectra: create a project and a peaklist in a Cara repository, then pick peaks of interest and trace their positions across time series using peak aliasing in Cara Monoscope. The `sort.py` script creates a cara repository with linked spectra in the dataset folder. Downstream analysis scripts read the peaks information from cara repositories at the moment. If analyzing multiple datasets at once, it is, however, convenient instead of having multiple Cara files, to have one Cara file with each dataset represented by own project and peaklist. Useful shortcuts for peak tracing in Monoscope:\n    - `Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2` - move between spectra\n    - `mp / ma` - move peak or its alias\n    - `gp` - go to peak\n    - `gs` - go to spectrum (if not argument provided will switch to the first spectrum in series)\n\n\n<a name=\"data_analysis\"></a>"

Create new dataset, including main information in its name, for simplification of automated analysis: `YYMMDD_INXXX_RNANAME_PROTEINNAME_TEMPERATURE_MAGNET` (e.g. `180914_IN71b_SMN1_coNUP1_303K_600`). Here, INXXX (IN71b) - is the experiment ID, implying same ID for the same RNA and protein combination. Replicate experiments are denoted with lowercase letter (IN71a, IN71b, ..) - so its easy to find similar experiments programmatically from shell, Matlab, etc.\n\n2. Make temperature calibration (we use expno 1 consistently).\n\n3. Insert the sample into magnet. Wait 1 min for temperature equilibration. Run `nmr/py/in_v0*` script for the setup of series. !! Check and test this script carefully before doing real runs !!.\n\n4. After the automation script has finished:\n    - In 2DHN spectrum - set the SW / carrier / TD / etc parameters to the values optimal for your protein\n    - Check the 90-degree 31P pulse value, and enter it into 1D31P experiment (in_v0* script runs `paropt` procedure, storing results in expno 4 999)\n    - If expect drift of tune-matching system: check the tune-match of channels of interest.\n    - Start reference (time0) experiments.\n\n    - **NOTE**: The key reference spectra required at this stage are 1D31P (as a reference for initial NTP concentration) and 2DHN (as a reference for initial protein peak positions / intensities). If the same batches of protein / NTPs are used - one can potentially start directly without recording new time0 references, and for downstream data analysis just make a copy of the references recorded in earlier days.\n\n5. Above script turns Autoshim off. In our experience Autoshim can introduce variation in lineshapes between individual 1D/2D spectra, which is later hard to distinguish from real changes in the network / molecule dynamics.\n\n6. While acquisition of reference (time0) spectra is running, use `nmr/py/createExpSeries.py` to generate time-series of repeating experiments for required time-period from the reference spectra. See the header of the script for details.\n\n7. If some tuning-matching was done during setup (if not doing consecutive measurements in the same buffer): check the probe did not detune on the channels of interest while references were running.\n\n8. Take sample out of the magnet, then:\n    - (2 min) add T7 RNA Pol, mix the sample, spin if need to remove bubbles, insert sample back to the magnet.\n    - Set the 'time0' tag in notes.txt (see below).\n    - run in_start_0* script - it will lock, check tune-match and do topshim twice.\n\n    - **NOTE**: remember/write down the time at which the RNA Pol was added. Later insert the exact time into the `notes.txt` file in the dataset directory. This file and time0 tag is automatically created by the `in_v0**` script. The <time0> tag gives the downstream analysis scripts info on when reaction was started, e.g.\n    `<time0>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0200</time0>`\n    **The analysis scripts can handle the time0 tag without timezone, but better include it for proper compatibility with NEO consoles (which write times in audita.txt in the UTC format -- not necessarily matching your timezone.**\n\n9. Start experiment series (`qumulti ##-##`).\n\n<a name=\"data_processing\"></a>"
