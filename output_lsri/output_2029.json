        "value": "1. Installation\n\n   Prerequisites of DeepDRK includes the following: \n\n   - R is properly installed; \n\n   - Rscript is available in your system path ($PATH);\n\n   - git (2.21.1)\n\n    Installation of DeepDR includes the following steps:\n\n    - step 1: git clone https://github.com/wangyc82/DeepDRK;\n\n    - step 2: download the combined training data (combination_data.RData) from https://wanglab.shinyapps.io/DeepDRK/, and put it in the DeepDRK folder.\n\n    Dependencies of DeepDRK includes the following: \n\n    - Readr1.3.1 and all its dependencies;\n\n    - Oracle JDK (Version 11.0.9 [Java SE Development Kit 11.0.9](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html));\n\n    - h2o package (Version 3.32.0.1 [h2o_3.32.0.1.zip](https://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-zermelo/1/index.html)) and its dependencies.\n\n    Testing of successful installation by running the following commands in R:\n     \n       > library(readr)\n       > library(h2o)\n       > h2o.init()\n\n\n2. Preparation of the input files\n\nIn total, six csv files are needed to represent the multi-omic profile of cancer cells, i.e., single nucleotide variant and small INDELs (mutation.csv), copy number alteration (CN.csv), DNA methylation (methylation.csv), gene expression (expression.csv), compound chemical properties (chem.csv), and known drug targets (DT.csv). \n\nThe input file mutation.csv that includes genomic mutations in cancer cells is a data matrix, with each row representing a cancer cell line and each column representing the genotype of a gene. The value of this matrix is binary, with 1 indicating mutated while 0 for wild type.\n \nmutation.csv\n\n              A1BG A1CF  A2M \u2026\n    201T       0     0    0\n    22RV1      0     1    0\n    42-MG-BA   0     0    1\n      .\n      .\n      .\n\nSimilarly, the input files that contain the copy number alteration data (CN.csv), the status of DNA methylation (methylation.csv), and the gene expression of the cancer cells (expression.csv) are also data matrices with a row representing a cancer cell line and a column representing a gene. The elements of these matrices are respectively integers for gene copy numbers, and float numbers for level of gene methylation and expression.\n\nexpression.csv\n\n               A1BG   A1CF    A2M \u2026\n    201T      3.162   2.919   3.379\n    22RV1     3.531   6.336   5.331\n    42-MG-BA  6.002   3.137   3.237\n      .\n      .\n      .\n\nThe input file chem.csv that describes the chemical properties of the cancer drugs is a matrix with each row representing one cancer drug and each column representing one feature to describe drug\u2019s chemical properties. The descriptors of the chemical properties of a cancer drug were inferred from its chemical structure. Particularly, to describe a drug, such as Erlotinib, we will need to first download the sdf file of this drug from PubChem, and then upload the chemical structure into \u201cStarVue\u201d (StarVue-macinstall-1.4.dmg) software to extract the 2D Molecular Operating Environment (MOE)) descriptors, including physical properties, atom counts, and bond counts.\n\nchem.csv\n\n              PUBCHEM_MOLECULAR_WEIGHT   PUBCHEM_EXACT_MASS    PUBCHEM_CACTVS_TPSA \u2026\n    Erlotinib            393.4                   393.2                  74.4\n    Rapamycin            917.2                   913.6                  195.0\n    Sunitinib            398.5                   398.2                  77.2\n       .\n       .\n       .\n\n\nThe input file DT.csv includes the known targeting proteins of the cancer drugs. Each row represents one cancer drug, and each column represents a target protein. \u201c1\u201d indicates a potential drug-gene interaction reported in DrugBank or KEGG.\n\nDT.csv\n\n                         EGFR                     KIT                   PDGRA \u2026\n    Erlotinib            393.4                   393.2                  74.4\n    Rapamycin            917.2                   913.6                  195.0\n    Sunitinib            398.5                   398.2                  77.2\n       .\n       .\n       .\n\nThe example of all input files can be found in the \u201cdata\u201d folder of the Github repository.\n\n3. Running DeepDRK\n\nThe main function of DeepDRK is DeepDRKpredictor.R. Get your input files prepared, and run it like this:\n\nUsage example:\n\n    > cell_tst<-list()\n    > library(readr)\n    > mutation <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/mutation.csv\");A<-data.matrix(mutation[,-1]);rownames(A)<-mutation$X1;cell_tst[[1]]<-A\n    > CN <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/CN.csv\");A<-data.matrix(CN[,-1]);rownames(A)<- CN$X1;cell_tst[[2]]<-A\n    > Methy <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/methylation.csv\");A<-data.matrix(Methy[,-1]);rownames(A)<- Methy$X1;cell_tst[[3]]<-A\n    > Exp <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/expression.csv\");A<-data.matrix(Exp[,-1]);rownames(A)<- Exp$X1;cell_tst[[4]]<-A\n    > drug_tst<-list()\n    > chem <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/chem.csv\");A<-data.matrix(chem[,-1]);rownames(A)<- chem$X1;drug_tst[[1]]<-A\n    > DT <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/DT.csv\");A<-data.matrix(DT[,-1]);rownames(A)<- DT$X1;drug_tst[[2]]<-A\n    > load(\"~/DeepDRK/combination_data.RData\") #load the training RData\n    > source('~/DeepDRK/DeepDRKpredictor.R')\n    > predictions<-DeepDRKpredictor(cell_tst,drug_tst)\n     Are you sure you want to shutdown the H2O instance running at http://localhost:54321/ (Y/N)? y\n     TRUE\n\nMoreover, DeepDRK could also handle task with missing features using the DeepDRKpredictor.e R function. Here is the example showing how to use it:\n\nIn case the mutation, methylation and target proteins are missing\n\n    > cell_tst<-list()\n    > library(readr)\n    > CN <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/CN.csv\");A<-data.matrix(CN[,-1]);rownames(A)<- CN$X1;cell_tst[[2]]<-A\n    > Exp <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/expression.csv\");A<-data.matrix(Exp[,-1]);rownames(A)<- Exp$X1;cell_tst[[4]]<-A\n    > drug_tst<-list()\n    > chem <- read_csv(\"~/DeepDRK/data/chem.csv\");A<-data.matrix(chem[,-1]);rownames(A)<- chem$X1;drug_tst[[1]]<-A\n    > drug_tst[[2]]<-matrix()\n    > missCtype=c(1,3)\n    > missDtype=2\n    > load(\"~/DeepDRK/combination_data.RData\") #load the training RData\n    > source('~/DeepDRK/DeepDRKpredictor.e.R')\n    > predictions<-DeepDRKpredictor.e(cell_tst,drug_tst,missCtype,missDtype)        \n    Are you sure you want to shutdown the H2O instance running at http://localhost:54321/ (Y/N)? y\n    TRUE\n\n"
