        "value": "Multiple mutational processes drive carcinogenesis, leaving characteristic signatures on tumor genomes. Determining the active signatures from the full repertoire of potential ones can help elucidate mechanisms underlying cancer initiation and development. This task involves decomposing the counts of cancer mutations, tabulated according to their trinucleotide context, into a linear combination of known mutational signatures. We formulate it as an optimization problem and develop sigLASSO, a software tool, to carry it out efficiently. SigLASSO features four key aspects: (1) It jointly optimizes the likelihood of sampling and signature fitting, by explicitly adding multinomial sampling into the overall objective function, This is particularly important when mutation counts are low and sampling variance is high, such as in exome sequencing. (2) sigLASSO uses L1 regularization to parsimoniously assign signatures to mutation profiles, leading to sparse and more biologically interpretable solutions resembling previously well-characterized results. (3) sigLASSO fine-tunes model complexity, informed by the scale of the data and biological-knowledge based priors. In particular, instead of hard thresholding and choosing a priori a discrete subset of active signatures, sigLASSO allows continuous priors, which can be effectively learned from auxiliary information. (4) Because of this, sigLASSO can assess model uncertainty and abstain from making certain assignments in low-confidence contexts. Finally, to evaluate SigLASSO signature assignments in comparison to other approaches, we develop a set of reasonable expectations (e.g. sparsity, the ability to abstain, and robustness to noise) that we apply consistently in a variety of contexts.\n"

        "value": "First of all, it is because mutation counts matter.\nMost other methods, including deconstructSigs, are invariant to different mutation counts. Let's say we observed 10,000 mutations in a cancer sample, this number is large therefore we should have a pretty good estimation of the mutational spectrum of the tumor. Here is a synthetic example.\n\n| Context  | Counts | Percentage |\n| -------- | --- | --- |\n|  AC>AA   |   511  |   5.11%  |\n|  AC>AC   |   305  |   3.05%  |\n|  AC>AG   |   96   |   0.96%  |\n|  AC>AT   |   913  |   9.13% |\n|   ...    |   ...  |  ...\t|\n|  TT>GT   |   0    |   0\t|\n\nBut life is not always so good. This time we sequenced another tumor but observed only 100 mutations. It could be because of exome sequencing, shallow sequencing depth or \"silent\" tumor. Now we are highly unsure about the spectrum.\n\n| Context  | Counts | Percentage |\n| -------- | --- | --- |\n|  AC>AA   |   5  |   5%  |\n|  AC>AC   |   3  |   3%  |\n|  AC>AG   |   1  |   1%  |\n|  AC>AT   |   9  |   9%  |\n|   ...    |  ... |  ...  |\n|  TT>GT   |   0  |   0   |\n\nAlthough the percentage is almost exactly the same as the previous sample, we are much less certain about our spectrum estimation here. For example, in the first sample, with 0/10,000 TT>GT, we are pretty certain that this mutation context is very rare. However, in the second sample, the last zero is very likely due to undersampling rather than a real, very low mutation frequency. Therefore, we should expect these two samples to have two different signature solutions. A more confident one for the first one, and a coarse one for the second sample to reflect the uncertainty in sampling. Most current signature tools will give identical solutions when the percentage matches.\n\nSigLASSO considers both sampling error (especially important when the mutation count is low) and signature fitting. \n\nMoreover, it parameterizes the model empirically. Let the data speak for itself. Moreover, you will be able to feed prior knowledge of the signatures into the model in a soft thresholding way. No more picking up signature subsets by hand! SigLASSO achieves signature selection by using L1 regularization.\n\n"
