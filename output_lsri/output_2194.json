All other messages from Cas-OFFinder will be directed to stderr.\n* 2.3\n  - Removed cl.hpp due to lack of C++ binding support in the new OpenCL 2.0 standard.\n  - Constant arguments are stored in constant or local memory, rather than global memory.\n  - Added support for 2bit format.\n  - Removed kseq.h\n  - Precise running time measurment on POSIX platform.\n* 2.2\n  - Corrected a critical bug (when cas-offinder finds no binding sites in the given genome chunk, it crashes).\n  - Now Cas-OFFinder reads whole fasta file at once, in order to achieve faster searching speed when it searches in FASTA files which contain many small scaffolds.\n* 2.1\n  - Using atomic operation, reduced computing load on CPU. In our benchmark, the total computation speed increased about twice as fast as before.\n  - When lowercase sequences are given, convert them uppercase sequences before computation.\n  - Corrected a bug (mixed bases were shown as lowercases letters, even they had been matched with normal bases).\n  - Now supports 'accelerators', with 'A' option.\n* 1.1\n  - When Cas-OFFinder is launched without parameters, now it display available device list.\n  - If the given chromosomes directory does not exist, now it returns an error message.\n  - Corrected a bug (when Cas-OFFinder couldn't find any OpenCL device it would hang).\n* 1.0\n  - Initial release.\n \n"

A range of device IDs can be\nspecified by using comma or colon to separate the IDs.  See examples\nbelow.\n\nThe special filename `-` may be used in place of the input and output filename\nto read and write from `stdin` and `stdout`, respectively.\n\nA short example may be helpful!\n\nFirst, download any target organism's chromosome FASTA files.

For example, to use the second GPU device\n(0-based):\n\n    $ ./cas-offinder input.txt G1 output.txt\n\nYou can use commas or colons to select range of devices:\n\n    $ ./cas-offinder input.txt G0,1 output.txt\n\nor\n\n    $ ./cas-offinder input.txt G0:2 output.txt\n\nThen the `TAB` separated output file will be generated with the following columns:\n\n- The first column is the sequence id, by default line numbers (0-based), or given IDs from the input file,\n- The second column is the type of bulge, the value is one of `X`, `DNA`, or `RNA`,\n- The third column is the given query sequence (including gaps in case of DNA bulge),\n- The fourth column is the actual sequence at the location (including gaps in case of RNA bulge; mismatched bases are noted in lowercase letters),\n- The fifth column is the sequence name (if you downloaded it from UCSC or Ensembl, it is usually a chromosome name),\n- The sixth column is the 0-based location of the off-target site (same convention as [Bowtie](https://github.com/BenLangmead/bowtie), not 1-based as IGV Viewer and others),\n- The seventh column is the direction of sequence, either forward (+) or reverse (-) strand of the found sequence,\n- The eighth column is the number of the mismatched bases,\n- The last column is the size of bulge.\n\n`output.txt` will be (shown here as a table for convenience):\n\n|Id    |Bulge type|crRNA                      |DNA                        |Chromosome|Location|Direction|Mismatches|Bulge Size|\n|:----:|:---------|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------|:--------:|:-------|:-------:|:---------|:--------:|\n|Seq2  |DNA       |`CGCCAGCGTCAGCGACAGG--TNNN`|`CcCCAGtGTCAGCcACAGGGCTCAG`|chr1      |34978273|-        |3         |2         |\n|Seq2  |DNA       |`CGC--CAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`CaCTCCAGCcTCAGCGACAGGcAAG`|chr1      |18173251|+        |3         |2         |\n|Seq2  |DNA       |`CG--CCAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`CaCTCCAGCcTCAGCGACAGGcAAG`|chr1      |18173251|+        |3         |2         |\n|Seq2  |DNA       |`C--GCCAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`CACtCCAGCcTCAGCGACAGGcAAG`|chr1      |18173251|+        |3         |2         |\n|Seq1  |DNA       |`GGCCGACC--TGTCGCTGACGCNNN`|`GGCCcAgCTCTGTCGCTGACGgGAG`|chr1      |40979785|+        |3         |2         |\n|Seq1  |DNA       |`GGCCGACCTGTCGCTGA--CGCNNN`|`GGCCGtCCTGTtGCTGAGACtCGGG`|chr1      |17408102|-        |3         |2         |\n|Seq1  |DNA       |`GGCCGACCTGTCGCTG--ACGCNNN`|`GGCCGtCCTGTtGCTGAGACtCGGG`|chr1      |17408102|-        |3         |2         |\n|Seq1  |DNA       |`GGCCGACCTGTCGCT--GACGCNNN`|`GGCCGtCCTGTtGCTGAGACtCGGG`|chr1      |17408102|-        |3         |2         |\n|...   |\n|Seq2  |X         |`CGCCAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`  |`CtCCAGCcTCAGCGACAGGcAAG`  |chr1      |18173253|+        |3         |0         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGNCCCAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`C-CCCCAGtGTCActGACAGGTGGG`|chr1      |5502832 |-        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGNCCCAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`t-CtCCAGCcTCAGCGACAGGcAAG`|chr1      |18173254|+        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGCCGCAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`CG-CGCAGCGaCAGgGAgAGGTGAG`|chr1      |1273663 |-        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGCCGCAGCGTCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`CGC-GCAGCGaCAGgGAgAGGTGAG`|chr1      |1273663 |-        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGCCAGCGTCGCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`CGCCtGCG-CGgAGCtACAGGTGAG`|chr1      |18888560|+        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGCCAGCGTCGCAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`aGCCAGCt-CtCAGCGACAGcTGAG`|chr1      |91631879|+        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGCCAGCGTCGTAGCGACAGGTNNN`|`CGCCtGCGg-GgAGCtACAGGTGAG`|chr1      |18888560|+        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGCCAGCGTCAGCGGCACAGGTNNN`|`CcCCAGaGTCAGC-GCACAGaTGGG`|chr1      |4006295 |-        |3         |1         |\n|Seq2  |RNA       |`CGCCAGCGTCAGCGACGAAGGTNNN`|`tGCCAGCGgCAGCGA-GAAGtTTAG`|chr1      |8462729 |+        |3         |1         |\n|...   |\n"
