We appreciate the attribution.  \nFollow **[@ecoontology on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ecoontology)** and check out the **[ECO website evidenceontology.org](http://www.evidenceontology.org)**. \nThe **[Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO)](http://www.evidenceontology.org/)** describes types of scientific evidence within the biological research domain that arise from laboratory experiments, computational methods, literature curation, or other means. Researchers use evidence to support conclusions that arise out of scientific research. Documenting evidence during scientific research is essential, because evidence gives us a sense of _why_ we believe what we _think_ we know. Conclusions are asserted as statements about things that are believed to be true, for example that a protein has a particular function (i.e. a protein functional annotation) or that a disease is associated with a particular gene variant (i.e. a phenotype-gene association). A systematic and structured (i.e. ontological) classification of evidence allows us to store, retreive, share, and compare data associated with that evidence using computers, which are essential to navigating the ever-growing (in size and complexity) corpus of scientific information. \nECO is an ontology comprising two root (upper-level) classes, 'evidence' and 'assertion method', where **'evidence'** is defined as \"a type of information that is used to support an assertion\" and **'assertion method'** is defined as \"a means by which a statement is made about an entity.\" Together 'evidence' and 'assertion method' can be combined to describe both the _supporting evidence_ for an assertion (such as a gene product annotation) and _the agent who made the assertion_, i.e. a human being or a computer. However, ECO can not be used to make an assertion itself; for that, one would use some other means, such as another ontology, controlled vocabulary, or <nowiki>[less desirably]</nowiki> a free text description. \nECO was originally created around the year 2000 to support [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org/) gene product annotations. GO continues to use ECO, now in the [AmiGO2](http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/landing) browser, [Noctua](http://noctua.berkeleybop.org/) web-based tool, and other applications. Today, **[many projects use ECO](http://www.evidenceontology.org/about_eco/#usergroups)** to document evidence information in scientific research, including protein & gene resources, model organism databases, software applications, phenotype projects, and more. ECO collaborates with the [Ontology for Biomedical Investigations](http://obi-ontology.org) Consortium in order to achieve [harmonious interactions](https://f1000research.com/posters/6-395). ECO is committed to the principles established by the [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry](http://obofoundry.org/) (OBO Foundry). \nIf you want to **help grow ECO for your own project** please contact us via the **GitHub Issue tracker**. If you are new to ECO, please take a look at our **[Rules for New Term Requests](https://evidenceontology.org/submit_term_request/)** on the ECO website or on the **[ECO GitHub wiki](https://github.com/evidenceontology/evidenceontology/wiki/New-term-request-how-to)**... and thanks!  \nFor **further information** including history, detailed discussion of evidence, and a complete bibliography, please visit the **[Evidence & Conclusion Ontology website](http://www.evidenceontology.org/)**. \nECO is released into the public domain under **CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)**.
