(skip if reads are already aligned) Align reads to preferred reference genome (e.g., using [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#command-line)).\n3. Call mutations using your favorite variant caller (e.g., [varscan](http://varscan.sourceforge.net/somatic-calling.html)).\n4. Convert variant caller output (VCF format) to Mutator input using `varscan2mutator.py`. Example usage to generate `mutator_input.tsv` from `my_variants.vcf`:\n```\npython3 varscan2mutator.py my_variants.vcf mutator_input.tsv\n```\n5. Run [CHISEL/Mutator.py](https://github.com/raphael-group/chisel/blob/master/src/chisel/Mutator.py) to extract cell-mutation pairs (see arguments at the top of the script). This script produces a TSV file  with columns CHR (chromosome), POS (position, CELL (cell barcode), MUT (variant allele), MUTCOV (number of reads from this cell containing the variant allele), COV (total number of reads from this cell that cover this position).\n6. Construct SBMClone input file [described above](#input) using a subset* of the mutations output by Mutator. \n\\*In principle, each row in the table could correspond to a 1-entry in the matrix provided to SBMClone. However, it may be useful to restrict the included mutations to those that are present in a sufficient number of cells, are supported by sufficiently many reads, and/or do not appear to be germline mutations (i.e., are absent from the matched normal or pseudonormal sample). For example, in our analysis of the DOP-PCR dataset in the paper, we restricted analysis to mutations with at least 10 total reads, present in <80% of tumor cells, and present in no more than 1 cell in the pseudo-normal sample (see Supplement section S11 for details)\n \n"

        "value": "In order to use the SV processing scripts, [LUMPY](https://github.com/arq5x/lumpy-sv) must be run with the following specifications:\n \n* LUMPY must be run with the `-b` option at runtime, which outputs SVs in BEDPE format instead of VCF. \n* LUMPY must also be run with the `-e` option at runtime, which includes evidence lines for each SV call in the output. This is necessary to retain the single-cell information. \n* The input BAM file for LUMPY should be preprocessed so that for every read, the read name is replaced with the corresponding cellular barcode (@CB field). This is to ensure that when LUMPY is run, the evidence lines for each SV will include the cellular barcode rather than the read name.\n\nThe SV processing scripts also include the option for filtering outputted SVs using genotyping stats determined by SVTyper. To use the filtering option, the genotyped VCF file outputted by SVTyper must first be sorted by the ID field. The command to sort the genotyped file `sv.gt.vcf` is:\n`grep '^#' sv.gt.vcf > sv.gt.sorted.vcf && grep -v '^#' sv.gt.vcf | sort -nk3 >> sv.gt.sorted.vcf`\n\n### Usage\nThe command to process a BEDPE file `sv.bedpe`, containing SVs called by LUMPY as specified above, is `python sv_process.py sv.bedpe`. Additional command line options can be included as described below.\n\n### Output\nThe command line script produces two output files, named with the default prefix \"sv_out\".\n* `sv_out.extracted.csv`: comma-separated text file that contains one line for each SV/cell combination, with information about each SV extracted from the BEDPE file. \n* `sv_out.sbm.csv`: binary mutation matrix in SBMClone format.\n"

The input format is a comma-separated text file in which each line encodes the row and column indices of a single 1-entry. For example, a file with the following lines:\n\n```\n0,1\n3,0\n1,1\n2,3\n3,2\n```\n\nspecifies a binary mutation matrix with the following form:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n```\n\nThe SBMClone script infers the size of the matrix from the input data. **Additional guidance on generating input data to SBMClone can be [found below](#generating-input-to-sbmclone)**.\n\n\n"
