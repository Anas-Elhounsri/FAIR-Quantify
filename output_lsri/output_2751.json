        "description": "### Features\r\n- In case metabolite suppressed data is supplied, OspreyFit has been updated to perform three separate linear-combination modeling runs.: 1) Using parameterized MM basis functions (standard approach with Gaussian functions); 2) Include the cleaned measured MM spectrum (denoised by using a spline function) in the LCM; 3) If multiple subjects are supplied a mean MM spectrum across all subjects is created and included in the last run. \r\n- Analysis of metabolite-suppressed data from edited and multiplexed spectra is now supported.\r\n- Add multiple MRS experiments to a single subject by adding another dimension to your input cell arrays. Osprey will load and process all spectra and concatenate them along the extra dimension.  In the current release, the extra dimension is not incorporated into the OspreyFit, OspreyQuantify or OspreyQuantify module. This will be part of a future release. However,  this can be used if for example, multiple MRS experiments need to be averaged e.g. two separate scans from the same voxel (See example jobSDAT_MEGA_Multidataset.m). After processing you have to call osp_AverageAllDatasetsAlongExtras to average the acquisitions. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- The MRSCont struct has been completely restructured. Therefore the files from older versions are not compatible, please re-run the analysis or use an older release version.",

File naming conventions for structural outputs are also reviewed.\r\n### Bug fix\r\n- More information to the OspreyProcess Module in the ops_plotModule and updated the wrong calcualtion of FWHM in ppm. This was done to match the GUI and print output. Thank you Deborah Barany for reporting this issue.\r\n- updated the nii viewer function to work for all kind of combinations of .nii and .nii.gz files \r\n- close the opts.PDF generated plots\r\n- MRShub.org report from Cristian Guerrero about 'Concatented' fitting not creating MRSinMRS.md\r\n- Siemens DCM loader bug for older spectra fixed (reported by Jill Naaijen)\r\n- Siemens HERMES/HERCULES coil combination not working when 4 averages are acquired in the water reference scan\r\n- Bug fix for Siemens TWIX PRESS data acquired on Connectom Scanner with VD software version\r\n- Single average RDA MEGA-PRESS data not being processed correctly",

Osprey automatically creates the needed control files and calls LCModel from within MATLAB. The results are imported back into Osprey to be used in the downstream modules.

You need to add compiled LCModel binaries into the libraries/LCModel folder ([visit for instructions](https://github.com/schorschinho/LCModel)).

        "description": "- Resolved issue #75: Instead of relying on Curve Fitting Toolbox functions (spmak, fnval) to generate the cubic spline basis functions, these are now created with an explicit iterative analytical procedure.\r\n- Fixed a major bug in the interactive job file creator, which caused all entries (except for the first) of the water reference file array to be wrongly populated with the file names of the water-suppressed (metabolite) data.\r\n- Added basis set for macromolecule-suppressed GABA-edited Philips MEGA-PRESS.\r\n- Removed separate version definitions for each sub-module - there is now one single version number for all modules.\r\n- Fixed an error occurring when short-TE water, but no water reference, was used.\r\n- Small fixes to errors caused during GUI calls.\r\n- Added fancy shields.io badges to the README file.\r\n\r\n",
