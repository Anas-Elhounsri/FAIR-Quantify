        "value": "Lung CT Analyzer is a 3D Slicer extension for lung, lobe and airway segmentation as well as spatial reconstruction of infiltrated, emphysematic and collapsed lung.  \n<b>Introduction</b><br>\nIn lung CT, the extent of pulmonary infiltration, ground glass opacity, consolitation and emphysema are usually analyzed visually. \nAbnormalities can not be quantified in numbers or milliliters making it difficult to objectively compare results. \nIn the current COVID-19 pandemia high case loads of patients with severe lung infiltrations accumulate and need meticulous follow up over time.   \nThe aim of this project (Lung CT Analyzer, LCTA) was to develop a software program that enables three-dimensional segmentation of lung CT data and calculate individual volumes of pulmonary infiltrates and emphysema. \n3D Slicer (1) is an established and freely available 3D imaging platform for scientific use and was chosen as development platform. Slicers inbuild Python was used as script language.   \n<br>\n[Video Lung CT Segmenter](https://youtu.be/U9PUX-jLF0A) <br>\n<br>\n[Video Lung CT Analyzer](https://youtu.be/JcgMnDhlknM) <br>\n<br>\n[Installation manual](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerLungCTAnalyzer/wiki/Installation)<br>\n<br>\n[Instruction manual](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerLungCTAnalyzer/wiki)</b><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Details</b><br>\nLung segmentation can be archieved by either placing a few markups on the lung or by using a deep learning lung and lobe segmentation algorithm (see below).\nA sensitive and manually assisted growcut airway segmentation is supported. \nThe Lung Analyzer uses thresholding and grow from seeds to identify five regions of interest: \"Bulla/emphysema\",\"Inflated\",\"Infiltrated\", \"Collapsed\" and \"Lung Vessel\". \nThe volume of each segment is calculated by \"Segment statistics\". \nThe results are then superimposed to 2D views in standard colors: \"Bulla\" = black, \"Inflated\" = blue, \"Infiltrated\" = yellow, \"Collapsed\" = pink and \"Vessel\" = red. \nIn addition, spatial reconstruction (3D) of the diseased lung segments is available. The total results of the segmentation include:<br>\n<br>\n<i>Total lung volume (100%)<br>\nRight lung volume (% of total lung volume)<br>\nLeft lung volume (% of total lung volume)<br>\nFunctional right lung volume (inflated, % of right lung volume)<br>\nFunctional left lung volume (inflated, % of left lung volume)<br>\nFunctional total lung volume (inflated, % of total lung volume)<br>\nAffected right lung volume (infiltrated + collapsed right volume, % of right lung volume)<br>\nAffected left lung volume (infiltrated + collapsed left volume, % of left lung volume) <br>\nAffected total lung volume (infiltrated + collapsed total volume, % of total lung volume) <br>\n<br></i> \nVessel volume is subtracted from lung volumes, intrapulmonary airways are not subtracted. <br>\n<br>\nLCTA has been developed and tested with 3D Slicer 5. The latest stable release is recommended.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Questions ? </b><br>\nThe best way to ask questions is using the [Slicer forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/).  go \"Support\", create a topic, mention \"@rbumm\" or add the \"lungctanalyzer\" keyword.
