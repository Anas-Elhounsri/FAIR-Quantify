In the process, it also provides estimates of the\nsequences' abundances. \nEMIRGE uses a modification of the EM algorithm to iterate between\nestimating the expected value of the abundance of all SSU sequences\npresent in a sample and estimating the probabilities for each read\nthat a specific sequence generated that read.  At the end of each\niteration, those probabilities are used to re-calculate (correct) a\nconsensus sequence for each reference SSU sequence, and the mapping is\nrepeated, followed by the estimations of probabilities.  The\niterations should usually stop when the reference sequences no longer\nchange from one iteration to the next.  Practically, 40-80 iterations is\nusually sufficient for many samples.  Right now EMIRGE uses Bowtie\nalignments internally, though in theory a different mapper could be\nused. \nEMIRGE was designed for Illumina reads in FASTQ format, from pipeline\nversion >= 1.3 \n1. emirge.py -- this version was designed for metagenomic data\n2. emirge_amplicon.py -- this version was designed for PCR amplicon data, and can handle up to a few million reads where the entire sequencing allocation is devoted to a single gene.
