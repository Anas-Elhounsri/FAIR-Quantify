Exactly two types per node.\n4) Date/Time is now considered metadata of the data model.  Even in the case where date/time are the core observation of the model (e.g. date of symptom onset) Thus, all models are identical in structure and metadata ([Figure 2](/Images/context_metadata.png)).\n5) This metadata takes the form of a \"context\" node (i.e. an RDF Quad, rather than an RDF Triple), which is annotated with various things.  In addition, the context node becomes \"part of\" a patient's overall timeline, which itself is modeled in RDF and creates a larger grouping of all observations about a patient.\n6) In addition to being \"part of\" a patient's timeline, context nodes _can be_ grouped into other arbitrary collections reflecting other kinds of groupings (like the COVID-19 infection scenario described above).  Its not mandatory to implement this in your model - it is merely made possible by this new model, which was not the case with the Version 1 models.\n  \n \n"
