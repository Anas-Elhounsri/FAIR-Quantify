Standard deviations are also calculated. \nHowever, as described in ISSUE [3](https://github.com/VoiceBeer/MS-MDA/issues/3), LOSO (Leave-one-subject-out) is also required, we therefore additionally evaluated our method in the LOSO paradigm with compared works (In the batch size of {16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512}). Note that these LOSO experiments are not included in the original paper, and since other works have not yet made their code open-source, we reproduced some of them. The results are shown below (csesn stands for cross-session, csub stands for cross-subject, the number next to it represents batch size, the best result for one transfer scenario is in bold): \n"
