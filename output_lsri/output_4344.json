        "description": "We put an entire directory of GTree excutable/3rd library files in this archieve. We have tested on 2 other Ubuntu computer which haven't configured GTree compiling environment, and GTree runs well. If any problems, please write an issue.\r\n\r\nPatch: \r\nWe find the errors : \"qcb could not initialized\" and \"Glew could not initialized\". It happened on Ubuntu which do not install Qt5-dev. \r\nThe reason is that plugins directories \"platforms\" and \"xcbintegrations\" are missing.\r\nWe update GtreeLinuxPortablev1.0_patch.zip to fix the problems. The Qt 5 libraries have been updated to 5.12.5. GtreeLinuxPortablev1.0_patch has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.\r\nIf showing no rights to execute GTree, please add executable property by running command \"chmod 777 ./GTree\".\r\n\r\nThe source_code.zip is added by github automatically. It is a useless package. However I do not know how to remove it.\r\n",
