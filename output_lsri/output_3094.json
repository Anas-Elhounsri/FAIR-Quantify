        "value": "In this work, we propose a novel drug repositioning approach by using Bayesian inductive matrix completion (DRIMC). Firstly, we embed four drug data sources into a drug similarity matrix and two disease data sources in a disease similarity matrix. Then, for each drug or disease, its feature is described by similarity values between it and its nearest neighbors, and these features for drugs and diseases are mapped onto a shared latent space. We model the association probability for each drug-disease pair by inductive matrix completion, where the properties of drugs and diseases are represented by projections of drugs and diseases, respectively. As the known drug-disease associations have been manually verified, they are more trustworthy and important than the unknown pairs. We assign higher confidence levels to known association pairs compared with unknown pairs. We perform comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, and DRIMC improves prediction accuracy compared with six stat-of-the-art approaches.\n \n"
