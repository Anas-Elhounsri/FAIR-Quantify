We designed mokapot\nto be extensible and support the analysis of additional types of proteomics\ndata, such as cross-linked peptides from cross-linking mass spectrometry\nexperiments. mokapot offers basic functionality from the command line, but using\nmokapot as a Python package unlocks maximum flexibility. \n"

        "description": "## [v0.10.0] - 2023-09-11\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n- Mokapot now uses `numpy.random.Generator` instead of the deprecated `numpy.random.RandomState` API.\r\n  New `rng` arguments have been added to functions and classes that rely on randomness in lieu of setting a global random seed with `np.random.seed()`. Thanks @sjust-seerbio! (#55)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Added linting with Ruff to tests and pre-commit hooks (along with others)!\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- The PepXML reader, which broke due to a Pandas update.\r\n- Potential bug if lowercase peptide sequences were used and protein-level confidence estimates were enabled\r\n- Multiprocessing led to the same training set being used for all splits (#104).",

        "description": "This release adds significantly more functionality, a small speedup, and expands the documentation \ud83c\udf89 \r\n\r\n### Added  \r\n- Support for downstream peptide and protein quantitation with\r\n  [FlashLFQ](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/FlashLFQ). This is accomplished\r\n  through the `mokapot.to_flashlfq()` function or the `to_flashlfq()` method of\r\n  `LinearConfidence` objects. Note that to support the FlashLFQ format, you'll\r\n  need to specify additional columns in `read_pin()` or use a PepXML input file\r\n  (`read_pepxml()`). \r\n- Added a top-level function for exporting confident PSMs, peptides, and\r\n  proteins from one or more `LinearConfidence` objects as a tab-delimited file:\r\n  `mokapot.to_txt()`.\r\n- Added a top-level function for reading FASTA files for protein-level \r\n  confidence estimates: `mokapot.read_fasta()`.\r\n- Tests accompanying the support for the features above.\r\n- Added a \"mokapot cookbook\" to the documentation with helpful code snippets.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Corresponding with support for new formats, the `mokapot.read_pin()` function\r\n  and the `LinearPsmDataset` constructor now have many new optional parameters.\r\n  These specify the columns containing the metadata needed to write the added\r\n  formats.\r\n- Starting mokapot should be slightly faster for Python >= 3.8. We were able to\r\n  eliminate the runtime call to setuptools, because of the recent addition of\r\n  `importlib.metadata` to the standard library, saving a few hundred\r\n  milliseconds.",
