This should build Inchworm and Chrysalis, both written in C++. Butterfly should not require any special compilation, as its written in Java and already provided as portable precompiled software, but *Java-1.8* (or higher) is required.\n\n>Note, starting with Trinity-v2.8, [cmake](https://cmake.org/) is required for building the software.\n\nAfterwards, you may want to build the additional plugin components that provide support for downstream analyses in which case you would then type:\n\n    %  make plugins\n\n\nAdditional tools required for running Trinity include:\n\n- [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)\n- [jellyfish](http://www.genome.umd.edu/jellyfish.html)\n- [salmon](http://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html)\n\nIf you want to install Trinity in a central location (not required), you can\n\n    %  make install\n\nand it'll copy the software package to /usr/local/bin/trinityrnaseq-version\n\nYou can set the environmental variable TRINITY_HOME to point to this, which will make it easy to access both Trinity as well as supported downstream applications that come bundled with Trinity.  \n\n    %   export TRINITY_HOME=/path/to/trinity/installation/dir\n\n>You can put the above command in your ~/.bashrc file so it'll be available to you by default.\n\nAdditional installation requirements:\n\n*  python 2.7 or 3.*  with numpy\n\n\nTrinity has been tested and is supported on Linux.\n\nTo test your installation of Trinity, try assembling the small sample data set provided with Trinity like so:\n\n    cd sample_data/test_Trinity_Assembly/\n    \n    ./runMe.sh\n\n\n"
