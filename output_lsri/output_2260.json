        "original_header": "1) How ProGeM works (in brief)",
        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "ProGeM adopts a two-pronged strategy consisting of a *\"bottom-up\"* and a *\"top-down\"* component, based on the underlying assumptions that in order for a given gene to mediate a molecular QTL that gene must be: (i) impacted functionally by either the sentinel or a corresponding proxy variant (bottom-up) and, (ii) that gene must then in turn impact the functioning of a molecular mechanism or biological process involved in the phenotype in question (top-down). \n**Proximal candidates**: \n    (i) ProGeM will identify the nearest genes to each sentinel variant.  The user can specify how many nearest genes they would like to pull out (default is 3), which can also be filtered on the basis of biotype of interest (default is \"protein-coding\").\n    (ii) ProGeM will also identify all genes that overlap the so-called \"LD region\" surrounding each sentinel variant.  This is defined as the range between the left-most and right-most sentinel/proxy variant plus an overhang.  The user can specify the size of the overhang (default is 5kb).  \n**Distal candidates**:\n    (iii) ProGeM will search GTEx v6p data to identify cis-eQTL target genes of sentinel and proxy variants.  The user can specify the tissues of interest (default is all GTEx tissues, n=44).\n    \nProGeM will also annotate bottom-up candidates with information from a user-supplied Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) output.  The pipeline annotates using the IMPACT column, which categorises variants according to whether their expected impact on gene function is \"HIGH\", \"MODERATE\", \"LOW\", or \"MODIFIER\".  ProGeM will highlight any bottom-up candidate mediating genes that contain either a sentinel or a proxy variant expected to exert a HIGH or a MODERATE IMPACT.  According the VEP, the IMPACT categories encompass the following variant CONSEQUENCES (http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/predicted_data.html):\n``` r\nHIGH_impact <- c(\"transcript_ablation\", \"splice_acceptor_variant\", \"splice_donor_variant\", \n                 \"stop_gained\", \"frameshift_variant\", \"stop_lost\", \"start_lost\", \n                 \"transcript_amplification\")\n\nMODERATE_impact <- c(\"inframe_insertion\", \"inframe_deletion\", \"missense_variant\", \n                     \"protein_altering_variant\", \"regulatory_region_ablation\")\n\nLOW_impact <- c(\"splice_region_variant\", \"incomplete_terminal_codon_variant\", \"stop_retained_variant\",                    \"synonymous_variant\")\n\nMODIFIER_impact <- c(\"coding_sequence_variant\", \"mature_miRNA_variant\", \"5_prime_UTR_variant\", \n                     \"3_prime_UTR_variant\", \"non_coding_transcript_exon_variant\", \"intron_variant\", \n                     \"NMD_transcript_variant\", \"non_coding_transcript_variant\", \"upstream_gene_variant\",\n                     \"downstream_gene_variant\", \"TFBS_ablation\", \"TFBS_amplification\", \n                     \"TF_binding_site_variant\", \"regulatory_region_amplification\", \n                     \"feature_elongation\", \"regulatory_region_variant\", \"feature_truncation\", \n                     \"intergenic_variant\")\n```\n \n**1.2. Top-down**. ProGeM has been designed to identify top-down candidates by pulling out genes that (i) reside \"locally\" to a sentinel variant AND (ii) have previously been implicated in the broad molecular phenotype in question.  For the former, the user can specify how \"locally\" is defined (the default is +/-500kb), and for the latter, we provide an .RData file containing a list of genes involved in metabolic-related molecular phenotypes.  The user can of course prepare a similar .RData file containing genes relating to other molecular phenotypes (i.e., lipidomics) for input to ProGeM.  OUr .RData file containing metabolic-related genes was prepared as follows: \n- **(ii)** Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG): all genes annotated to the top-level metabolism pathway (hsa01100) \n- **(iii)** Orphanet: all genes annotated to the \"rare inborn errors of metabolism\" (ORPHA:68367) category \n- **(v)** Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI): all human orthologs of mouse genes annotated to the Mammalian Phenotype term \"abnormal metabolism\" (MP:0005266) \n**1.3. Cooccurring candidates**. ProGeM will also prioritise genes that appear as both bottom-up AND top-down candidates for a given sentinel variant.  These genes are so-called \"concurrent\" genes and should be considered primary causal candidates based on the fact that they satisfy both of the above-mentioned underlying assumptions of a causal gene.\n \n"

Your proxies can be derived either directly from your sample or, for example, from 1000 genomes data.  If proxies have not been pre-filtered prior to input, then ProGeMM will filter based on a user-defined r2 threshold (default r2 is 0.8) if desired. \n**3.3.** The output (as a .txt file) after running the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP: http://grch37.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Tools/VEP) using both sentinels and proxies as input.  The user is free to decide upon the parameters used to run the VEP, though the output must contain a column with (i) sentinel rsIDs as well as a column with (ii) proxy rsIDs - in the \"ProGeM_settings.R\" files the user is asked to indicate the column indices of their VEP output that contains this information.  For VEP records/rows corresponding directly to a sentinel variant, then the sentinel rsID should be entered in both the sentinel rsID and the proxy rsID column.  Further, in the VEP output there should be a separate record/row for each sentinel-proxy combination, meaning that if a variant is a proxy for more than one sentinel variant in your dataset, then there should be more than one VEP record/row for that proxy variant.   \n"
