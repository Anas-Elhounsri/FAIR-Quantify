Micobiome single nucleotide polymorohisms (SNPs) can be detected in shotgun metagenomics sequencing via alignment to databases of genes or genomes. However, this approach is computationally intensive (requiring high-performance computing) and is only accurate for abundant species (with at least 5x sequencing coverage).  \nGut Database: \nWe built a database of common SNPs within the core genomes of species that are prevalent in human stool. Leveraging these SNPs, we designed a \"virtual genotyping array\". This highly compressed data structure is comprised of 31-basepair (bp) \"probes\" which contain each allele of 56 million bi-allelic SNPs (from 881 gut species) with 15-bp flanking sequence on either side and which have no known exact match to any other species.   \n \n"

It returns counts of reads exactly matching each allele of each SNP in a concise table-shaped format for its output, with one row for each bi-allelic SNP site that has exactly 8 fields: species, global position, contig, contig position, allele 1, allele 2, coverage of allele 1 and coverage of allele 2.

The GT-Pro can be added to the system path so that the main program can be accessed from anywhere. Reference through full path is also allowed.  \n\n<b>Notes for C++ compiler</b>\n\nGT-Pro requires a C++ compiler that is compatible with C++ 11 standards to work properly. All the tests have been done and passed with clang-900.0.38, but it should be compatible for GNU C Compiler (newer than 5.4.0). We have not tested GT-Pro with older compilers, but we expect it to run similiarly as long as it compiles successfully.  \n\nTo use GT-Pro in a computing environment where the compilation does not go through. This [prebuilt version](https://github.com/zjshi/gt-pro/releases/tag/v1.0.1) may be used as an alternative. But we still recommend a compilation when possible.  \n\n<b>Notes for Conda env</b>\n\nThanks to [Nick Youngblut] (https://github.com/nick-youngblut), we now have conda environment files.\n"

An example can be found as the following:\n\n* extract test species directories as inputs  \n`tar xzvf test/100035.tar.gz && tar xzvf test/101747.tar.gz && tar xzvf test/102779.tar.gz`\n\n* build a three-species GT-Pro database   \n`./GT_Pro build --in test/build.list --out ./test/my_db --dbname tri_db --threads 4`\n\nThe database building of GT-Pro has a simple interface, which only requires a input file (specified by --in) containing a list of species directories and a output directory (specified by --out) for hosting intermediate and end files related to database building.\n\nIn the the example above, GT-Pro reads a input file which contains paths to three species directories and generates a three-species sck-mers database using four threads. Both `test/build.list` and three species directories are included in the test directory.  \n\nEach species directory should contains the following items:\n1. a subdirectory named 'genomes' containing whole genomes of strains (n >= 10) in the species\n2. a reference genome file named 'reference.fna' \n3. a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) named 'msa.fa', which should be generated by mapping the genomes in 1 to the reference genome in 2\n4. a VCF file named 'core_snps.vcf' describing SNP sites in the coordinate of the reference genome in 2 and genotypes across genomes in 1\n5. (Optional) a tsv file named 'coords.tsv' describing core genome regions that GT-Pro will use for k-mer extraction.\n\nBoth `msa.fa` and `core_snps.vcf` are in standard format. In our paper, we mainly used [MUMmer4](https://mummer4.github.io/) to generate these files. Note that MUMmer4 does not include both files as its standard output and so please expect some addition effort converting MUMmer4 output. If you want to skip that, we recommend using [Maast](https://github.com/zjshi/Maast) which takes 1 and 2 and generates 3, 4 and 5 for you.\n\nNote:\n* we now have a protocol help build customized GT-Pro database, please see [Identifying species-specific k-mers for fast and accurate metagenotyping with Maast and GT-Pro] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666166722008449)\n\nThe `coords.tsv` has three fields including chrom, start and end and each row specifies a core genome region on a contig (chrom) starting from start to the end. We generated the file again mainly using MUMmer4. This argument is optional, if not supplied, GT-Pro will use all genomic regions when possible.\n\nThe --dbname can used for assigning a database name. It is optional and when not supplied, GT-Pro will use a default name of 'sckmer_db'. The --threads flag tells GT-Pro how many threads to use to build the database. \n\nUpon the successful completion of the example command, you may find the following files included in the designated output directory:\n\n1. `tri_db.bin`, the body of the customized database.\n2. `tri_db.snp_dict.tsv`, a SNP dictionary file for parsing the raw output from GT-Pro with the customized database.\n3. `tri_db.species_map.tsv`, a file in the format of tab separated values that maps species labels to input species directories.\n\nFor more descriptions on other arguments, simply type in\n\n`/path/to/GT_Pro build -h`\n\nNote: building a database for a large number of species may consume a lot of computing resource as well as take long time. We do not recommend to build large databases on a personal computer.\n\nGT-Pro chooses a default k=31 and both database building and metagenotyping code is heavily optimized over this choice. It does not take other k for database building.\n"
