The interface is subdivided into Basic and Expert modes\nto provide a customisable experience suited to each user's background. \nThe docker image and the installation script will contain some example data sets. To analyze your\nown data you can use the upload function, or create/modify the scripts in the ``scripts/``folder.\nCreating a custom script is much more flexible and allows, if necessary, batch correction,\nquality filtering and/or translation of probe names. \nMore detailed information and feature explanation of Omics Playground is\navailable in the `online documentation <https://omicsplayground.readthedocs.io>`__.\n \n"

        "description": "# Release Notes\r\n\r\nFirst public release. This release was succesfully built on Ubuntu 19.04 with R 3.5.2 and Bioconductor 3.8. The matching docker release is `bigomics/omicsplayground:v1.0` . This source code and docker release is compatible with the journal publication in NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics (see below). The nickname was chosen because we were 'always almost' ready to release.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- Ubuntu 19.04\r\n- R 3.5.2\r\n- Bioconductor 3.8\r\n\r\n## Matching docker release\r\n- `docker pull bigomics/omicsplayground:v1.0` .\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Compatible with Omics Playground journal publication: Akhmedov M, Martinelli A, Geiger R and Kwee I. Omics Playground: A comprehensive self-service platform for visualization, analytics and exploration of Big Omics Data. *NAR Genom Bioinform*, Volume 2, Issue 1, March 2020, lqz019.\r\n\r\n",

Pull the docker image using the command::\n\n    docker pull bigomics/omicsplayground\n\n   Warning. The docker image requires about 5GB-8GB hard disk space. Note: download\n   version v1.0 if you want the exact version of the NAR/GAB publication, otherwise\n   docker will download the latest version by default.\n\n2. Now run the docker with::\n\n    docker run --rm -p 4000:3838 bigomics/omicsplayground\n\n3. Then open ``http://localhost:4000`` in your browser to access the platform.\n"
