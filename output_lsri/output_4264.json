It then selects reads within a specified number of restriction sites from the diagonal(default = 2) and models the background as a negative binomial. It calls peaks regions that significantly exceed the background.\nThe output is a list of peaks with their properties and a bedgraph at a restriction site level resolution that describes the reads per site.\nUsing the differential analysis command it can be used to create a consensus peakset and then identify differentially bound regions across samples. \nResults from this package can then be used for further analysis and as a peaks dataset input for various loop calling software.\n \n"

This includes a file that previous versions of HiC-pro created in the directory (allValidPairs.mergestat)\n\nThis command will generate the following files:\n\n- log.log file, contains all the inputs used, the logs and the quality metrics calculated such as number of peaks called and fraction of reads in peaks.\n- bedgraph.bdg file, containing the coverage track with all the reads used in the peak calling step.\n- peaks.bed file, contains all the peaks called. The 3 extra information columns are:\n  * average signal in the peak\n  * maximum signal in the peak\n  * -log10 of p value of the peak\n- report.pdf, contains some useful plots and quality metrics.\n\nIf enabled this command will also generate:\n- diffpeak_data.pickle, file containing the information necessary for differential peak analysis.\n- mat_obj.pickle, file containing the sparse matrix representation at a restriction site level of all the interactions. Currently in development but you can look into site_matrix_class.py to understand how it works.\n"
