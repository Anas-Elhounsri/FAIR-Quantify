For this normalization we had either measured the amount of\n  mRNA per cell or found it in the literature (fig.\u00a01 \u2013 fig. supplement\n  2 of our paper). However we don\u2019t currently have such values for the\n  endothelial cells and CAFs. Therefore for these two cell types, we use\n  an average value, which might not reflect their true value and this\n  could bias a bit the predictions, especially for these cell types. If\n  you have some values for these mRNA/cell abundances, you can also add\n  them into EPIC, with help of the parameter \u201c*mRNA_cell*\u201d or\n  \u201c*mRNA_cell_sub*\u201d (and that would be great to share these values).\n\n  If the mRNA proportions of these cell types are low, then even if you\n  don\u2019t correct the results with their true mRNA/cell abundances, it\n  would not really have a big impact on the results. On the other side,\n  if there are many of these cells in your bulk sample, the results\n  might be a little bit biased, but the effect should be similar for all\n  samples and thus not have a too big importance (maybe you wouldn\u2019t be\n  fully able to tell if there are more CAFs than Tcells for example, but\n  you should still have a good estimate of which sample has more CAFs\n  (or Tcells) than which other sample for example).\n"

You can then check the \u201c*fit.gof\\$convergeCode*\u201d (and\n  possibly also \u201c*fit.gof\\$convergeMessage*\u201d) that is outputted by EPIC\n  alongside the cell proportions. This will tell you which samples had\n  issue with the convergence (a value of 0 means it converged ok, while\n  other values are errors/warnings, their meaning can be found in the\n  help of \u201c*optim*\u201d (or \u201c*constrOptim*\u201d) function from R (from \u201c*stats*\u201d\n  package) which is used during the optimization and we simply forward\n  the message it returns).\n\n  The error code that usually comes is a \u201c1\u201d which means that the\n  maximum number of iterations has been reached in the optimization.\n  This could mean there is an issue with the bulk gene expression data\n  that maybe don\u2019t completely follow the assumption of equation (1) from\n  our manuscript. From our experience, it seems in practice that even\n  when there was such a warning message the proportions were predicted\n  well, it is maybe that the optimization just wants to be *too\n  precise*, or maybe few of the signature genes didn\u2019t match well but\n  the rest of signature genes could be used to have a good estimate of\n  the proportions.\n\n  If you have some samples that seem to have strange results, it could\n  however be useful to check that the issue is not that these samples\n  didn\u2019t converge well. To be more conservative you could also remove\n  all the samples that didn\u2019t converge well as these are maybe outliers,\n  if it is only a small fraction from your original samples. Another\n  possibility would be to change the parameters of the optim/constrOptim\n  function to allow for more iterations or maybe a weaker tolerance for\n  the convergence, but for this you would need to tweak it directly in\n  the code of EPIC, I didn\u2019t implement such option for EPIC.\n"

Indeed, when building such in silico\n  samples, the fact that different cell types express different amount\n  of mRNA is usually not taken into account. On the other side, if\n  working with true bulk samples, then you should compare the true cell\n  proportions (measured e.g., by FACS) against the *cellFractions*.\n"
