        "value": "FIBSI is a generalization and extension of the method described in this publication by the authors: \nThis program was developed to address the need for a signal analysis tool that can detect significant phenomena in time series data while handling these properties common to many biological signals: \n1. The pattern generator underlying these phenomena is not known, or may not be distinguishable from noise in the frequency domain. \n   *For example, in Odem 2018, we demonstrated that irregular action potential (AP) firing was a common feature of chronic pain nociceptor phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that the generator driving it is inherently stochastic so as to avoid central nervous system filtering. \n2. Sampling period is generally short because of the fragile nature of many biological signals \n   *For example, patch-clamp electrophysiology setups are stable for only a few minutes. When analyzing AP frequency, a 2hz firing rate produces only 4 APs in a 2 minute recording. \n3. Sampling is conducted in low signal strength, high noise environments. \n   *For example, in Odem 2018, the subthreshold fluctuations deviated from resting membrane potential by 1.5-3mV, whereas the traditional signal analyzed from neurons in patch-clamp, the AP, is 50mV+ in deviation. \n4. Many biological data are shaped by factors proximate-in-time to the signal, then by long-term factors \n   *For example, an AP is triggered by an immediately preceding increase in membrane potential on the order of milliseconds; the likelihood of triggering is set by protein expression and electrolyte balance set by the neuron on the order of hours to days \n5. The shape of the biological signal's deviation from baseline is often as informative as the frequency. \n   *For example, APs are often characterized by their threshold (where the rate of deviation increases substantially, though part of the same waveform), amplitude, duration, and afterhyperpolarization waveform, not just their frequency. \n"

A variety of functions can be applied to generate this reference line, such as a running mean, linear regression, median, etc. This reference line is referred to as fitY (for fitted Y series) \n3. (A) Events (i.e. signals) are identifed iteratively by reading across the X-dfY series from x=start to x=end. The start of an 'above' event is identified when the first Y value is encountered that has a value >=0. Each subsequent Y value that remains above 0 is considered part of the 'above' event. The end of the 'above' event is identified when the first Y value below 0 is encountered. The Y value one point previously (x-1) is set as the end point of that 'above' event. The inverse ruleset applies for 'below' events. \n4. In some situations, the event information can be used to recalculate the reference line. For example, in Odem 2018, the first 'round' of event identification was used to identify APs, then to remove the X-Y data that corresponded to an AP from the raw dataset, and finally to run a second 'round' of event identification on the modified X-Y data. This removed the influence of APs on functions like the running median, that depend highly on local environment, for the purpose of analyzing the subthreshold fluctuations that produce APs. \n   *A reference line can also be calculated based off of the peaks of 'above' events (or troughts of 'below' events). \n5. Various properties about the events can then be calculated and output in a variety of ways. \n"
