Obtain the code\nDownload the code from GitHub (to make git submodule work user has to do the git clone to download the code)\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:LLNL/ddcMD.git\n```\n\n## 2. Build code\nAfter downloading, go to the ddcMD home directory and use git submodule command to obtain three dependent libraries: \nNVIDIA [CUB](https://github.com/NVlabs/cub) library and LLNL [simutil](https://github.com/LLNL/simutil) and [recbis](https://github.com/LLNL/recbis) libraries.\n```\ncd ddcMD\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n### 2.1. Use CMake \nCompile code without GPU/CUDA\n\n```\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake -DUSE_GPU=OFF ../\nmake -j16\n```\n\nCompile code with GPU/CUDA\n\n```\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake -DUSE_GPU=ON ../\nmake -j16\n```\n\nUse IBM XL compiler\n```\nCC=xlc CXX=xlc++ cmake ../\n```\n\nUse Intel compiler\n\n```\nCC=icc CXX=icpc cmake ../\n```\n\n### 2.2. Use makefile\n\nThe makefile is in ddcMD/src directory. If the make command is successful, an executable, ddcmd-{arch}, will be generated in ddcMD/bin\n```\ncd src\nmake\n```\n\n#### 2.2.1. Support architectures\nCurrently, the code only supports a few architectures as shown in ddcMD/arch\n```\napple.mk  armbuntu.mk  macosx.mk  sierra.mk  summit.mk  toss3.mk\n```\n\nThe code determines the architecture by the hostname of the machine defined in ddcMD/arch/Makefile.arch. For example, in the ddcMD/arch/Makefile.arch the script to build code on the Summit at ORNL is defined as\n```\nifeq ($(HOSTNAME_D), summit)\n  ARCHGUESS = summit\nendif\n```\nThe script will invoke summit.mk during the building process.\n\nIf user wants to build the code on a machine with the hostname that cannot find in ddcMD/arch/Makefile.arch, user can add the new hostname to the file and use the corresponding \\*.mk architecture file. If user cannot find the architecture file in ddcMD/arch, user can use any of the \\*.mk files as template and modify compiler flags and libraries.\n\n\n"
