        "value": "DeepND is a cross-disorder gene discovery algorithm (Deep Neurodevelopmenal Disorders algorithm) It analyzes comorbid neurodevelopmental disorders simultaneously and explicitly learns the shared and disorder-specific genetic features using multitask learning. Thus, the predictions for the disorders depend on each other's genetic architecture. The proposed DeepND architecture uses graph convolution to extract associations between genes from gene coexpression networks that model neurodevelopment. This information is processed by a mixture-of-experts model that can self-learn critical neurodevelopmental time windows and brain regions for each disorder etiology which makes the model interpretable. We provide a genomewide risk ranking for each disorder. \nThe model can easily be extended to work with more than 2 comorbid disorders of any kind (not necessarily neurodevelopmental disorders) or with other types of gene interaction networks. The model can also work in a singletask mode to analyze disorders independently which is referred as DeepND-ST. \n"

This demo is designed to generate predictions for ASD and ID on an average personal computer. Therefore, the inputs are limited to pLI and a single network which is the brain gene co-expression network for MDCBC region between adolescence and mid-adulthood. \n\nRequired inputs, such as spatio-temporal brain co-expression networks, gene features and gold standards are provided in the \"Data\" folder.  All of the reqired parameters are already set in the <i>config</i> file as default values.\n\n1. Download all files and installing required packages as explained under [Installation Guide](https://github.com/ciceklab/DeepND#installation-guide).\n\n2. Run the following terminal command:\n\n```\npython main.py\n```\nThis command will run the main function of the DeepND which sorts gold standard gene lists, creates randomized masks for the cross-validation, initializes the model and starts training.\n\nAfter each training, the best model is saved as a \".pth\" file to reproduce results later on and to enable more advanced trainin procedures (such as transfer learning) if needed. Before each trial, the allocated and cached GPU memory is reported so that you monitor and adjust your inputs according to your own computer's limitations.\n\nAn example terminal output of the main process would be as follows.\n\n![Example terminal output](https://github.com/ciceklab/DeepND/blob/master/example.png)\n\n3. The output will be written to MultiExp00 folder which contains:\n    - Saved models for each training as \".pth\" files\n    - Prediction results for first disorder (ASD), and the second (ID) in separate .txt files\n    - Experimental stats (mean, stdev and median of performance metrics, runtime etc.) in runreport.txt file\n    - Tensors that highlight weights of spatio-temporal brain networks for different subset of genes as \".pt\" files\n    - pyTorch and Numpy random states for reproducing the same results in test mode\n\nYou may also try running this demo with different gene interactions networks. Several examples networks that are mentioned in the artice are publicly avaliable at  [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3892979](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3892979). You can download any number of networks from there, and adjust the <i>config</i> file accordingly before repeating Step 2.\n"
