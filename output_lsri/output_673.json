It is crucial for core facilities and imaging scientists to be acknowledged on manuscripts where their systems have been used. To this end, this final dialog box asks the user to input the name of the core facility, any staff member who contributed to training and support for the microscopy experiments, and a Research Resource ID (if applicable). These inputs will be used for text generation of a draft acknowledgement sentence, which can be revised and added to a manuscript.\n\n<br />\n"

        "value": "This Python/Jython script requires [Fiji/ImageJ](fiji.sc) - a recent or fresh installation of Fiji is recommended, since the script requires that the BioFormats library is installed, and that the OMERO plugins are disabled.\n\nMethodsJ2 version 1.0 available in this repository, tested in Fiji (ImageJ version 1.53c) on macOS Mojave 10.14.6 and macOS Catalina 10.15.7, and in Fiji (ImageJ version 1.53c) on Windows 10 Home. Requires BioFormats. Please note that OMERO plugins must be disabled in Fiji.\n\nAs requirements, to use **MethodsJ2**, users first need a raw image from a microscopy experiment as well as a previously generated in [Micro-Meta App](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-Electron/releases/tag/1.2.2-b1-1) microscope hardware specifications file (.json) (see bioRxiv preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.31.446382v2)). \n\nThe script runs in Fiji, and an active internet connection is required. A demo microscope hardware specifications file (.json) and image are provided to test the script.\n\n<br />\n\n\n<br />\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: As per MethodsJ, this is not meant to be applied blindly, but rather to be used as a starting point. Metadata is recorded by the microscope driving software, so at best it reflects the way the microscope's software was configured. In addition, this script uses the fantastic BioFormats library. It has been designed to extract as much information as possible from the image data, but formats change occasionally so don't be surprised if the text doesn't completely reflect what you expect. If you do find some discrepancy, check with your facility staff (if the microscope is part of an imaging facility) for help on the appropriate wording or to check the configuration, and then with the BioFormats community to see if the metadata was not read correctly. If you believe there is an error in the script (not unlikely), feel free to reach out.\n\n\n**Importantly**, please verify the text generation output and the csv file carefully or with someone familiar with the microscope or your experiments, in order to make sure that the information is correct, and that the grammar and syntax are ok, before copy-pasting the text into your manuscript. \n\n\n<br />\n"

Alternatively, click on File > New > Script... to open a script editor window, and then in that script editor, click on File > Open, navigate to the appropriate folder and select MethodsJ2_v1_2_.py\n\nOnce the script is loaded, make sure the appropriate language is selected - click on Language, select Python.\n\nClick the \"Run\" button, and follow the dialog boxes, filling in the information as accurately as possible. More information on each dialog box is given below\n\nWhen first running the script in Fiji, it may take up to ~30 seconds for the script to launch (before seeing the first dialog box). Running the script is pretty quick, and simply depends on availability of the required information about the image. If all parameters are known by the user, it should take only a couple of minutes to go through the script and generate a draft methods section. \n\n<br />\n"

For example, information about the objective might be stored in the image metadata as \"PlanApo 100x NA 1.4 (Zeiss)\" or \"Zeiss 100X Plan-Apo 1.4 N.A.\" or other permutations of the same information, depending on who set up the microscope. This makes text/string matching difficult. Thus, in the csv file, the user can directly compare and judge for themselves whether the information is accurate, by directly comparing the image metadata information with the user selection. \n\nAs an example, rows 21 and 24 ('Microscope' and 'Select Objective') in the following screenshot are examples of information which coincide accurately, but do not have matching text.\n\n\n![CSV_output_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64212264/128735433-6a44693a-46cb-432c-a495-8f94a8741ffb.PNG)\n\n> See [the example csv file here](https://github.com/ABIF-McGill/MethodsJ2/blob/main/MethodsJ2_methods_text_BPAE_3color_30p-200ms_63xOil_003_diffExp_Int___000.csv)\n\n\n<br />\n\n"
