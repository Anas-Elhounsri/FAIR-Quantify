PhysiCOOL takes advantage of Python's popularity and simplicity to\nmake PhysiCell studies more accessible and enables users to integrate Python-based calibration tools with their PhysiCell\nworkflows. \nAlthough PhysiCOOL was designed to create full model calibration workflows, its components can be used independently \naccording to the users' needs. For instance,this novel package implements a file parser that enables users to read and \nwrite data to the PhysiCell XML configuration file using simple Python commands. Data validation is performed when \nnew information is written to the files, assuring that the new values are consistent with PhysiCell's requirements \nand assumptions. Furthermore, PhysiCOOL also provides new functions to process and visualize simulation outputs which \ncan be used for both parameter exploration and model calibration.\n \n"

PhysiCOOL aims to simplify this process by letting \nusers select the parameters to be changed based on PhysiCell's data structures with Python objects:\n\n```python\nfrom physicool.config import ConfigFileParser\n# Parse the data from the config file\nxml_data = ConfigFileParser(\"config/PhysiCell_settings.xml\")\n# Read the cell parameters for the \"default\" cell definition\ncell_data = xml_data.read_cell_data(\"default\")\n# Update and write the new parameters to the config file\ncell_data.motility.bias = 0.5\nxml_data.write_cell_params(cell_data=cell_data)\n```\n\nAnother important PhysiCOOL component is data validation, which is not available through standard XML libraries. \nFor instance, in this code snippet, PhysiCOOL automatically checks if the new migration bias value is between 0 and 1, \nas it is defined by PhysiCell that this parameter should be inside this range.\n"

PhysiCOOL allows users to connect their PhysiCell compiled scripts to Python-based \nfunctions in order to create a black-box model with three main components:\n\n- A function that updates the PhysiCell configuration file with new input parameters values;\n- The PhysiCell model;\n- A function that reads the model outputs and computes the desired output metric.\n\nThese black-box models are modular in the sense that the users can select what functions to use to update the \nconfiguration file and to process the results. For instance, users can decide to change the cells' motility parameters \nand evaluate the effect on the distance traveled by cells over time. Alternatively, the cell cycling rates could be \nvaried to analyze the evolution of the number of cells.\n\n![black_box](docs/img/black_box)\n"
