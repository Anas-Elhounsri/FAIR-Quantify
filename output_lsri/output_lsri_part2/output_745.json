We provided example input files in ```testdata``` folder, and they will also be used in the tutorial.\n- **A text file listing out the samples associated with each group we would like to run CSREP on**: For each group of samples, you will need to prepare a file where each line shows a sampleID. For example, the ESC group from Roadmap has 5 samples: ```E003, E008, E014, E015, E016```, each sample has a segmentation file ```<sampleID>_chr22_core_K27ac_segments.bed.gz``` as input data in our tutorial.

Reasons that we highly recommend using snakemake include: (1) If you have computing cluster available, you can easily train multiple models for CSREP in parallel through different jobs using Snakemake --> huge reduction in runtime. Snakemake gracefully manages the parallel jobs and automatically rerun jobs that were left unfinished. Additionally, Snakemake manages pipeline in such a way that it can run jobs from where the pipeline were unfinished or changed, therefore saving users lots of time babysitting jobs. (2) Snakemake ensures the consistency in computing environment, therefore ensuring the reproducibility of our results. \n\nIn order to run CSREP either to **summarize** the chromatin state maps for one or multiple group(s) of samples, or to **calculate the differential** chromatin scores between two groups, you can follow two steps: \n(1) prepare input data files/folders\n(2) modify the config file that we provided with user-input parameters (this step is very quick once you understand the meaning of different parameters in ```config/config.yaml```). \nDetails about how to run CSREP are below:\n"

CSREP allows users to calculate the summary chromatin state maps for multiple groups of samples simultaneously.\n\nBelow, we present the parameters and the file structures outputted by CSREP. We also provide a tutorial for running CSREP on our test data. If reading the following list of parameters gets too confusing, you can skim through it, then go to the tutorial and look back at this list for reference. We also provide file ```cheatsheet_csrep_manual.pdf``` to help you better understand the parameters. \n\nParameters in ```config/config.yaml``` include:\n- ```is_calculate_diff_two_groups```: **0** if you want to calculate the summary (representative) chromatin state map for >=1 groups of samples. **1** if you want to calculate the differential chromatin scores between two groups of samples.\n- ```all_cg_out_dir```:  The folder where the **output** data (representative/differenntial chromatin state maps) for all groups of samples are stored. Within this folder, each subfolder will correspond to a group (for the summary task) or to a pair of groups (for the differential state calculation task). You decide through ```all_cg_out_dir``` where this data is stored.\n- ```raw_user_input_dir```: the folder where all **input segmentation data files** of all samples, regardless of their group memberships, are stored.\n- ```all_ct_segment_folder```: A folder where we store the segmentation data of all samples, after processing from the ```raw_user_input_dir```. The tutorial will be helpful in understanding the role of this folder, if you care. You decide through ```all_ct_segment_folder``` where this data is stored.\n- ```raw_segment_suffix```: The suffix of input samples' segmentation files. In the tutorial, inside input folder ```test_data/raw_data``` (corresponding to ```raw_user_input_dir```), each sample's segmentation file name is of format ```<sampleID>_chr22_core_K27ac_segments.bed.gz```, then ```raw_segment_suffix``` would be ```_chr22_core_K27ac_segments.bed.gz```.\n- ```training_data_folder```: the folder where CSREP stores chromatin state segmentation data used for training, which corresponds to 10% of the genome, for each sample. You decide through ```training_data_folder``` where this data is stored.\n- ```chrom_length_fn```: path to the BED file that stores the length of chromosomes. This is useful in sampling the training regions for CSREP. You can use ```utils/get_chrom_length_from_segmentation.sh``` to generate this file, or you can write it yourself. \n- ```sample_genome_fn```: a BED file where the locations of training regions for CSREP are stored. You decide through ```sample_genome_fn``` where this data is stored.\n- ```chromhmm_state_num```: number of chromatin states that are in the model for each sample. \n- ```train_mode_list```: the list of training mode that you would like results for. ```multi_logistic``` for CSREP and ```baseline``` for base_count, as presented in the paper. \n- ```cell_group_list```: the list of group names of groups of samples in that we would like to calculate the representative/differential chromatin state maps for. If ```is_calculate_diff_two_groups``` is set to 1 (meaning you want to calculate differential chromatin scores), then ```cell_group_list``` should specify two group names, otherwise the program may inform you of an error.\n\n"
