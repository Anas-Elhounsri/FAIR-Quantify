        "value": "# Instructions for DEVELOPERs of ODK\n\nThis is intended for developers only, see [README](README.md) for the\nmain docs.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor running locally without Docker you will need\n\n * robot\n * owltools\n * python3.6 or higher\n\nSee [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for details on how to obtain these\n\n## How it works\n\nPreviously ODK used a perl script to create a new repo. This iterated\nthe [template/](template) directory and used special magic for expanding into a\ntarget folder. This has been replaced by python code\n[odk/odk.py](odk/odk.py) with makes used of Jinja2 templates.\n\nFor example, the file\n[template/src/ontology/Makefile.jinja2](template/src/ontology/Makefile.jinja2)\nwill compile to a file `src/ontology/Makefile` in the target/output\ndirectory.\n\nJinja2 templates should be fairly easy to grok for anyone familiar\nwith templating systems. The syntax is very similar to Liquid\ntemplates, which are used extensively on the OBO site. We feed the\ntemplate engine with a project object that is passed in by the user\n(more on that later).\n\nLogic in the templates should be non-existent.\n\n## Dynamic File Names\n\nSometimes the odk needs to create a file whose name is based on an\ninput setting or configuration; sometimes lists of such files need to\nbe created.\n\nFor example, if the user specifies 3 external ontology dependencies,\nthen we want to see the repo with 3 files `imports/{{ont.id}}_import.owl`\n\nRather than embed this logic in code, we include all dynamic files in\na single \"tar-esque\" formated file: [template/_dynamic_files.jinja2](template/_dynamic_files.jinja2)\n\nThis file is actually a specification for multiple files, each target\nfile specified with `^^^`. Because the parent file is interpreted\nusing templates, we can have dynamic file names, and entire files\ncreated via looping constructs.\n\n## The Project object\n\nCurrently the datamodel is specified as python dataclasses, for now\nthe best way to see the complete spec is to look at the classes\nannotated with `@dataclass` in the code.\n\nThere is a [schema](schema) folder but this is incomplete as the\ndataclasses-scheme module doesn't appear to work (TODO)...\n\nThere are also example `project.yaml` files in the\n[examples](examples) folder, and these also serve as rudimentary unit\ntests.\n\nSee for example [examples/go-mini/project.yaml](examples/go-mini/project.yaml)\n\nThe basic data model is:\n\n * An `OntologyProject` consists of various configuration settings, plus `ProductGroup`s\n * These are:\n    * An `ImportProduct` group which specifies how import files are generated\n    * A `SubsetProduct` group which specifies how subset/slim files are generated\n    * Other product groups for reports and templates\n\nMany ontology projects need only specify a very minimal configuration:\nid of ontology, github/gitlab location, and list of ontology ids for\nimports. However, for projects that need to customize there are\nmultiple options. E.g. for an import product you can optionally\nspecific a particular URL that overrides the default PURL.\n\nNote that for backwards compatibility, a project.yaml file is not\nrequired. A user can specify an entire repo by running `seed` with\noptions such as `-d` for dependencies.\n\nNote that in all cases a `project.yaml` file is generated.\n\n## ODK commands\n\n```\n$ ./odk/odk.py --help\nUsage: odk.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\nOptions:\n  --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  create-dynfile   For testing purposes\n  create-makefile  For testing purposes\n  dump-schema      Dumps the python schema as json schema.\n  export-project   For testing purposes\n  seed             Seeds an ontology project\n```\n\nThe most common command is seed.\n\n## Updating a Makefile and/or repo\n\nPreviously with odk there was no path to either upgrading an existing\nproject with new settings (i.e. adding an import) OR to take advantage\nof changes to the odk (e.g changes in the core Makefile).\n\nThis should now be easier with the new odk, although the\nimplementation emphasis has been on the seed command. Some things that\nwill make this easier:\n\n * Convention of using a second loaded Makefile for custom changes\n * Maintaining a project.yaml in root folder will allow easy regeneration\n\nTODO: add a refresh command. This could run odk *in place*, but\npreserving protected files. TBD how to determine protected\nfiles. Obviously the edit file should not be touched. Could use git\nlog to determine if any modifications have been made?\n\n## Setting up a new machine for ODK development\n\nIn order to build and publish ODK, you need the following:\n\n1. `docker` installed\n2. have `git` installed\n3. have a git user.name and user.email set\n\n## General SOP for ODK release and publication\n\n- There are three types of releases: major, minor and development snapshot.\n  - Major versions include changes to the workflow system.\n  - Minor versions include changes to tools, such as ROBOT or Python dependencies.\n  - Development snapshots reflect the current state of the `main` (`master`) branch.\n- They all have slightly different procedures which we will detail below.\n\n### Major releases\n\nMajor releases contain changes to the workflow system of the ODK, e.g. changes to the `Makefile` and various supporting scripts (e.g. run.sh, update_repo.sh).\nThey require users to update their repository with `sh run.sh make update_repo`\nMajor releases are typically incremented (a bit confusingly) on the \"minor\" version number of ODK, i.e. 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 etc.\nThere are currently (2024) no plans to increment on the major version - this will likely be reserved to fundamental changes like switching from `make` to another workflow system or dropping `docker` (both are unlikely to happen in the midterm).\nThere should be no more than 2 such version updates per year (ideally 1), to reduce the burden on users to maintain their repositories.\n\n#### SOP for creating a major release\n\n* Put the `master` branch in the state we want for release (i.e. merge any approved PR that we want included in that release, etc.).\n* Ensure your local `master` branch is up-to-date (`git pull`) and run a basic build (`make build tests`). This _should_ not result in any surprises as this exact command is run every time we merge a change into the `master` branch by our CI system. However, as various dependencies of the system are still variable (in particular unix package versions), there are occassionally situations where the build fails or, less likely, the subsequent tests.\n* Do any amount of testing as needed to be confident we are ready for release. For major releases, it makes sense to test the ODK on at least 10 ontologies. In 2024 we typically test:\n  * All ontologies we test for _minor_ releases (see below)\n  * Flybase ontologies ([fbbt](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-anatomy-developmental-ontology), [fbcv](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-developmental-ontology), [dpo](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-phenotype-ontology))\n  * [NCBITaxon](https://github.com/obophenotype/ncbitaxon)\n  * [Zebrafish Phenotype Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/zebrafish-phenotype-ontology) (should only be done in collaboration with a ZP core developer, too many points of failure)\n* We suggest to have at least 1 other ODK core team member run 3 release pipelines to reduce the risk of operating system related differences.\n* Run `docker login` to ensure you are logged in. You must have access rights to `obolibrary` organisation to run the following.\n* Run `docker buildx create --name multiarch --driver docker-container --use` _if you have not done so in the past_. NOTE: This command needs to be run only once. Its effects are persistent, so it will never be needed again for any subsequent release \u2014 unless you completely reset your Docker installation in the meantime.\n* Run `make publish-multiarch` to publish the ODK in the `obolibrary` dockerhub organisation (see [below](#multi-arch-images) for details).\n* OPTIONAL: If you want publish the multi-arch images under the `obotools/` organisation, you need to run locally:\n  ```sh\n  $ docker buildx create --name multiarch --driver docker-container --use\n  $ make publish-multiarch IM=obotools/odkfull IMLITE=obotools/odklite DEV=obotools/odkdev\n  ```  \n* Immediately when the release is finished, create and publish a GitHub release (check last major release on how to format correctly).\n* After the release is _published_, create a new PR updating the `VERSION = \"v1.X\"` variable in the `Makefile` to the next major version number.\n\n### Minor releases\n\nMinor releases are normally releases that contain only changes about the _tools_ provided by the ODK, and no changes about the _workflows_. As such, they do not require users to update their repositories. All users need to do to start using a new minor release is to pull the latest Docker image of the ODK (`pull obolibrary/odkfull:latest`).\n\nMinor releases are only provided for the current major branch of the ODK. For example, if the latest major release is v1.5, we will provide (as needed) minor releases v1.5.1, v1.5.2, etc, but we will _not_ provide minor releases for any version prior to 1.5; once v1.6 is released, we will likewise stop providing v1.5.x minor releases. In other words, only one major branch is actively supported at any time.\n\n#### SOP for creating a minor release\n\n* As soon as a major branch (v1.X) has been released, create a `BRANCH-1.X-MAINTENANCE` branch forked from the `v1.X` release tag.\n* As development of the next major branch (v1.X+1) is ongoing, routinely backport tools-related changes to the `BRANCH-1.X-MAINTENANCE` branch.\n* By convention, changes to the next major branch that are introduced by a PR tagged with a `hotfix` label should also be backported to the maintenance branch.\n* To avoid cluttering the maintenance branch with multiple \u201cPython constraints update\u201d backport commits, it is recommended to backport all Python constraints at once, shortly before a minor release.\n* There are no strict guidelines about when a minor release should happen. The availability of a new version of ROBOT is usually reason enough to make such a release, but upgrades to other tools can also occasionally justify a minor release.\n\nOnce the decision to make a minor release has been made:\n\n* Make sure all tools-related updates (including Python tools) have been backported.\n* Do any amount of testing as needed to be confident we are ready for release. For minor releases, it makes sense to test the ODK on at least 5 ontologies. In 2024 we typically test:\n  - [Mondo](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo) ([docs](https://mondo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer-guide/release/)) (a lot of use of old tools, like owltools, interleaved with ROBOT, heavy dependencies on serialisations, perl scripts)\n  - [Mondo Ingest](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/mondo-ingest) (a lot of use of sssom-py and OAK, interleaved with heavyweight ROBOT pipelines)\n  - [Uberon](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon) (ROBOT plugins, old tools like owltools)\n  - [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/human-phenotype-ontology) (uses of ontology translation system (babelon), otherwise pretty standard ODK, high impact ontology)\n  - [Cell Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology) (Relatively standard, high impact ODK setup)\n* Update the CHANGELOG.md file.\n* Bump the version number to `v1.X.Y` in\n  - the top-level `Makefile`,\n  - the `Makefile` in the `docker/odklite` directory.\n* If the minor release includes a newer version of ROBOT, and if that has not already been done when ROBOT itself was updated, update the version number in `docker/robot/Makefile` so it matches the version of ROBOT that is used.\n* Push all last-minute changes (CHANGELOG and version number updates) to the `BRANCH-1.X-MAINTENANCE` branch.\n* Build and publish the images from the tip of the `BRANCH-1.X-MAINTENANCE` branch (same procedure as above to build and publish a major release).\n* Create a GitHub release from the tip of the `BRANCH-1.X-MAINTENANCE` branch, with a `v1.X.Y` tag.\n* Resume backporting changes to the `BRANCH-1.X-MAINTENANCE` until the time comes for the next minor release.\n\n### Development snapshot\n\nDevelopment snapshots reflect the current state of the main (`master`) branch. They do not undergo the same level of testing (or any testing at all) as the normal releases, and are intended to help trialing and debugging the changes that happen in the `master` branch.\n\nDevelopment snapshots should _not_ be used in a production environment. Feel free to use them if you want to help us developing the next major release, but if you use them in your production pipelines, understand that you\u2019re doing so at your own risk.\n\nDevelopment snapshots are tagged with the `dev` tag on docker, and with the `-dev` suffix in the `Makefile` pipeline (e.g. `v1.6-dev` to indicate that this is a snapshot of the ODK on the way towards a 1.6 release). Development snapshots can happen any time, but typically happen once every 1 to 4 weeks.\n\n#### SOP for creating a development snapshot\n\n* Put the `master` branch in the state we want for release (i.e. merge any approved PR that we want included in that release, etc.).\n* Ensure your local `master` branch is up-to-date (`git pull`) and run a basic build (`make build tests`) (see comments in Major release section for details about the rationale).\n* We do not typically do any additional testing for the development snapshot.\n* Run `docker login` to ensure you are logged in. You must have access rights to `obolibrary` organisation to run the following.\n* Run `docker buildx create --name multiarch --driver docker-container --use` _if you have not done so in the past_. NOTE: This command needs to be run only once. Its effects are persistent, so it will never be needed again for any subsequent release \u2014 unless you completely reset your Docker installation in the meantime.\n* Run `make publish-multiarch-dev` to publish the ODK in the `obolibrary` dockerhub organisation (see [below](#multi-arch-images) for details).\n* Do NOT create a GitHub release!\n* Your build has been successful when the `dev` image appears as updated [on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/obolibrary/odkfull/tags).\n\n## Docker\n\nNote that with v1.2 the main odkfull [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is at\nthe root level. We now use a base alpine image for compactness, and\nselectively add in unix tools like make and rsync.\n\nNote also that we include odk.py and the template folders in the\nimage. This means that odk seed can now be run from anywhere!\n\nTo build the Docker image from the top level:\n\n```\nmake build\n```\n\nNote that this means local invocations to use `obolibrary/odkfull`\nwill use the version you built.\n\nTo test:\n\n```\nmake tests\n```\n\nTo publish on Dockerhub:\n\n```\nmake publish\n```\n\n<a id=\"multi-arch-images\"></a>\n\n### Multi-arch images\n\nTo build multi-arch images that will work seemleassly on several\nplatforms, you need to have [buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx)\nenabled on your Docker installation. On MacOS with Docker Desktop,\n`buildx` should already be enabled. For other systems, refer to Docker's\ndocumentation.\n\nCreate a *builder* instance for multi-arch builds (this only needs to be\ndone once):\n\n```\ndocker buildx create --name multiarch --driver docker-container --use\n```\n\nYou can then build and push multi-arch images by running:\n\n```\nmake publish-multiarch\n```\n\nUse the variable `PLATFORMS` to specify the architectures for which an\nimage should be built. The default is `linux/amd64,linux/arm64`, for\nimages that work on both x86_64 and arm64 machines.\n\nTo publish only the development version:\n\n```\nmake publish-multiarch-dev\n```\n\nSometimes, it may be necessary to delete the multiarch and redo it (roughly once per month):\n\n```\ndocker buildx rm multiarch\ndocker buildx create --name multiarch --driver docker-container --use\n```\n\n## Some notes on templating and logic\n\nThere is a potential for some confusion as to responsibility for\nlogic. On the one hand we have dependency logic in the Makefile. But\nwe also have minimal logic in deciding what to put in the Makefile.\n\nFor example, we could move some logic from the Makefile by using\nfor/endfor Jinja constructs and unfolding every product in a group and\nhave an explicit non-pattern target in the Makefile. Or we can\ncontinue to write targets with patterns. Or we can do a mixture of\nboth.\n\nAdditionally there is some minimal logic in the python odk code, but\nthis is kept to an absolute minimum; the role of the python code is to\nrun template expansions.\n\nIn general the decision is to keep the templating as simple as\npossible, which leads to a slight mixed two level system.\n\nOne gotcha is the two levels of comments. The `{# .. #}` comments are\ntemplate comments for the eyes of developers only. These are ignored\nwhen compiling down to the target file. Then we also have Makefile\ncomments `#` which remain in the target file, and are intended for\nadvanced ontology maintainers who need to debug their workflows. These\nare intermingled in Makefile.jinja2\n\n## Unit Tests\n\nTo run:\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\nThese will seed a few example repos in the target/ folder, some from command line opts, others from a project.yaml\n\nThese are pseudo-tests as the output is not examined, however they do\nserve to guard against multiple kinds of errors as the seed script\nwill often fail if things are not set up correctly.\n\nThe examples folder serves for both unit test and documentation purposes.\n\n## Migration System\n\nTODO\n\n## Pull request rules\n\n1. One PR per feature.\n2. Each PR must link to one or more existing issues.\n3. There should be one commit per logical change. This is important so we can be more effective at cherry picking for patch releases.\n4. Every commit should have an appropriate title and description.\n\n## Major minor system\n\n- Once a release is done, we work on the master branch towards the next major release\n- The minor release steward cherry picks certain kinds of changes for minor releases, including\n   - ROBOT updates\n   - Python tool version updates\n   - Critical bug fixes \n\n## Adding new programs or Python modules to the ODK\n\nHow and where to add a component to the ODK depends on the nature of the\ncomponent and whether it is to be added to `odkfull` or `odklite`.\n\nAs a general rule, new components should probably be added to `odkfull`,\nas `odklite` is intended to be kept small. Components should only be\nadded to `odklite` if they are required in rules from the ODK-generated\nstandard Makefile. Note that any component added to `odklite` will\nautomatically be part of `odkfull`.\n\nIs the component available as a standard Ubuntu package? Then add it to\nthe list of packages in the `apt-get install` invocation in [the main\nDockerfile](Dockerfile) (for inclusion into `odkfull`) or in [the\nDockerfile for odklite](docker/odklite/Dockerfile).\n\nIs the component available as a pre-built binary? Be careful that many\nprojets only provide pre-built binaries for the x86 architecture. Using\nsuch a binary would result in the component being unusable in the arm64\nversion of the ODK (notably used on Apple computers equipped with M1\nCPUs, aka \"Apple Silicon\").\n\nJava programs available as pre-built jars can be installed by adding new\n`RUN` commands at the end of either the main Dockerfile (for `odkfull`)\nor the Dockerfile for `odklite`.\n\nIf the component needs to be built from source, do so in [the Dockerfile for odkbuild](docker/builder/Dockerfile), \nand install the compiled file(s) in either the `/staging/full` tree or the `/staging/lite` tree, for\ninclusion in `odkfull` or `odklite` respectively.\n\nIf the component is a Python package, adds it to the `requirements.txt`\nfile, and *also* in the `requirements.txt.lite` file if it is to be part\nof `odklite`. Please try to avoid version constraints unless you can\nexplain why you need one.\n\nPython packages are \"frozen\" before a release by installing all the\npackages listed in `requirements.txt` into a virtual environment and\nrunning `python -m pip freeze > constraints.txt` from within that\nenvironment.\n"

There are different ways to do this. \n * Manually compare your ontology against the [template](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/template) folder and make necessary adjustments\n * Run the seed script as if creating a new repo. Manually compare this with your existing repo and use `git mv` to rearrange, and adding any missing files by copying them across and doing a `git add`\n * Create a new repo de novo and abandon your existing one, using, for example, github issue mover to move tickets across.\n \nObviously the second method is not ideal as you lose your git history. Note even with `git mv` history tracking becomes harder. \nIf you have built your ontology using a previous version of ODK,\nmigration of your setup is unfortunately a manual process. In general\nyou do not absolutely *need* to upgrade your setup, but doing so will\nbring advantages in terms of aligning with emerging standards ways of\ndoing things. The less customization you do on your repo the easier it\nshould be to migrate. \nConsult the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file for changes made between\nreleases to assist in upgrading.\n \n"

        "description": "We thank the community for all your support and feedback! Without your [issues](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues) and [contributions](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pulls) we would not be able to do our work!\r\n\r\n## Update instructions\r\n\r\nhttps://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/odk-update/\r\n\r\n## Highlights and possibly breaking changes (Read this!)\r\n\r\n- All processes within the ODK container now **runs under the identity of an (unprivileged) user by default**. This fixes the issue of generated files being owned by the superuser, when the Docker daemon itself runs as the superuser (as is the case by default on most GNU/Linux systems). See [PR1](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/769), [PR2](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/900), [PR3](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/905).\r\n    - **Consequences:** Some workflows that require superuser rights may not work anymore as expected.\r\n    - **Mitigation:** If you have a workflow that requires being run as a superuser (for example, if you need to install extra Debian/Ubuntu packages via `apt-get`), set the environment variable `ODK_USER_ID` to 0 when running that workflow or, to always run all workflows as a superuser (as was the case in previous ODK versions), set the configuration parameter `run_as_root` to `True` before updating your repository.\r\n- Change the definition of **\"base release\"**. See [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/810).\r\n    - **Consequence:** The base file now does not only contain the editors axioms in their raw form, but the axioms \"as intended by the ontology developer\", for example, including inferences. For the base-specification see [here](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/reference/base-specification/).\r\n    - **Mitigation:** If you want a release that corresponds exactly to the old base file, use `baselite` instead.\r\n- Allow refreshing the mirrors (externally downloaded ontologies) under `IMP=false`. See [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/973).\r\n    - **Consequence**: you now _cannot rely on `IMP=false` anymore_ if you want to avoid refreshing mirrors as well - you need to use `IMP=false MIR=false` instead!\r\n- Make qc.yml ODK managed by default, so it is actually being updated along with the rest of the files. See [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/990).\r\n    - **Consequence:** If you have overwritten that workflow with custom content, you have to follow the mitigation strategies.\r\n    - **Mitigation:** (1) migrate the custom content to a differently named workflow or (2) deactivate syncning of that workflow manually by adding a `workflows` section to your ODK config.\r\n- Generate `custom_reports` during release process [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/997).\r\n    - **Consequence:** This means that all reports configured in ODK are automatically updated at release time, so you have more files need to review during a release. \r\n    - **Mitigation:** Add your reports to `.gitignore` or remove them from your ODK config.\r\n- We added the \"International Edition\" as a release product, including an entire workflow system for managing translations using the [Babelon format](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/babelon). This feature is still under development, but works - feel free to reach out if you like to test it.\r\n\r\n## New and updated tooling\r\n\r\n- New [ROBOT Version 1.9.5](https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/tag/v1.9.5) was added in a previous minor release.\r\n- A lot of updated python tools, including [OAK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit) (0.5.25), [SSSOM tools](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom-py) (0.4.4), [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) (1.7.5), kgx (2.2.5) and [curies](https://github.com/cthoyt/curies) (0.7.7). A full list of all available python tools and their versions is available [here](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/v1.5/constraints.txt).\r\n- The [Babelon Toolkit](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/babelon) (0.2.7) for managing multilingual ontologies has been added as well.\r\n- Added [table-reader plugin](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-table-reader-plugin/) for mkdocs to directly integrate CSV files into your ontology documentation, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/861).\r\n- Added Perl module Business::ISBN, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/886).\r\n- Updated Apache Jena (4.9.0), Souffl\u00e9, Fastobo-validator, Ammonite REPL & Script-Runner (2.5.9), DOSDP-Tools (0.19.3), Relation-Graph (2.3.2).\r\n- Added [SSSOM-Java](https://incenp.org/dvlpt/sssom-java/) (0.7.5) ([PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/958)) and [KGCL-Java](https://incenp.org/dvlpt/kgcl-java/) (0.3.2) ([PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/995)) to `odkfull`.\r\n\r\n## New configuration options\r\n\r\n- Add option to include defined-by annotation in imports, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/929).\r\n- Add option `release_annotate_inferred_axioms`, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/996), to enable the annotation of inferred axioms during release.\r\n\r\n## Makefile workflows\r\n\r\n- Make it possible to collect per-command resource usage data, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/940). This allows us to see which goals consume how much memory, and how long they take, to identify performance bottlenecks.\r\n- Enable support for custom ROBOT plugins in ODK, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/968)\r\n- Add a `test_fast` goal to allow running tests without refreshing dependencies [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/803).\r\n- Re-integrate LightRDF RDF/XML validation, see [PR1](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/850), [PR2](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/928)\r\n- Add SPARQL Check to find uses of deprecated DC [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/817)\r\n- Add release diff action, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/737). This allows posting diffs automatically as a comment to a Pull Request.\r\n- Add convenience check if customised ROBOT report config is out of date [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/998). This allows checking if you are missing out on some new ROBOT report checks!\r\n- Add a nicer, more comprehensive way to understand the versions of the tools used in ODK, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/1011).\r\n\r\n## Runner and Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Allow passing configuration options to the OWL API, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/807).\r\n- Automatically check whether the repository needs to be updated, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/873).\r\n- Forward the host SSH agent socket into the container, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/853).\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n- Fix import to use `OBOBASE` in base-iri, not `URIBASE`, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/823).\r\n- Do not create individual import modules when `use_base_merging` is enabled, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/829).\r\n- Make docs workflow configurable, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/889).\r\n- Update `illegal-date-violation.sparql` to accept `xsd:dateTime`, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/932).\r\n- Update URL to show CI status badge correctly on repo README.md, see [PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/978).\r\n\r\n## For more detailed overview of the changes see:\r\n\r\n- [Milestone definition](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/milestone/7)\r\n- [All changes since the last major release](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/compare/v1.4...v1.5)\r\n",

        "description": "## Update instructions\r\n\r\nhttps://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/odk-update/\r\n\r\n## Changes from ODK 1.3.1 to 1.4\r\n\r\nA full record of all changes can be seen [here](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/milestone/6?closed=1).\r\n\r\n### New and updated tooling\r\n\r\n- New [ROBOT Version 1.9.3](https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/tag/v1.9.3)\r\n- A lot of [updated python tools](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/constraints.txt), including [OAK (0.1.71)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit), [SSSOM tools](https://github.com/mapping-commons/sssom-py) (0.3.22), [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) (1.4.4) and [curies](https://github.com/cthoyt/curies) (0.4.2).\r\n- `gh` is now installed in ODK, which means that GitHub workflows can be run directly through ODK. For example, try out the new `public_release` workflow which automatically creates a GitHub release for you.\r\n- A full list of all available python tools and there vesions is available [here](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/constraints.txt)\r\n\r\n### New configuration options \r\n\r\n- Making the `uribase` configurable. You can now set the URI base in your `myont-odk.yaml` file to something different from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/, which enables developers from outside OBO to use ODK. Note that there is no guarantee that you can export your ontology to the OBO file format of you customise your `baseuri` this way!\r\n- `import_component_format`: You can now configure the format in which your imports and components are serialised. For example, rather than owl (RDFXML), which used to be the default, you can set this option to ofn. For a complete reference see https://robot.obolibrary.org/convert.\r\n- `mirror_type`: You can define the type of the mirror for each import. Supported: base, custom, no_mirror.\r\n- `release_use_reasoner`: If false, no reasoning is performed for generating release files. This is only relevant for building application ontologies, where all components are already fully classified.\r\n- `sparql_test_on`: You can define the list of input files to run the custom SPARQL queries. Supported: edit, and any release artefact, e.g myont-base.owl ([example](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/tests/test-sparql-report.yaml)).\r\n- `use_edit_file_imports`: If TRUE, use whatever imports you have in the edit file to create the release (default). If FALSE,  components (and imports) are merged into the release independent of whether they are mentioned in the edit file or not. This can help for example in cases where import modules are so large, they cannot be checked into version control.\r\n- The `ci` option now takes `gitlab-ci` as a value, which sets your repo up with basic Continuous Integration Testing for GitLab.\r\n\r\n### Makefile workflows\r\n\r\n- Adding new `make reason_test` command ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/639), [issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/645))\r\n- Adding intermediate artefact `$(TMPDIR)/$(ONT)-preprocess.owl` to the release workflow which enable the centralisation of preprocessing in a single make step. Basically, rather than creating release artefacts directly from the editors file (e.g. bfo-edit.owl), we add intermediate step from which all releases are derived. This intermediate can then be customised by the user ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/639), [issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/544))\r\n- Introduces an experimental new release called \"base-plus\", which includes the inferred and non-redundant classification of the ontology. This is highly experimental and may be removed in a future release of ODK. The new goal is much more rigorous in removing axioms from other ontologies as well. The old base file can now be exported as an  \"editors release\" instead ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/643), [issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/646)).\r\n- Introduces the option of skipping the use of reasoner during the release process (important for application ontologies), ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/643), [issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/644))\r\n- Introduces a new mode that enable the use of ODK entirely without owl:imports in the edit file (this is great in case we want to use the ODK workflows but not check in any files, imports or components, into version control, like huge application ontologies), ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/643), [issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/629)).\r\n- Adds a feature to directly support ROBOT templates in components ([example](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/tests/test-templates.yaml)). Templates need to be activates with the project-level `use_templates: TRUE` option, and can then be used to define components, like in the example.\r\n- Adds an option to do a `public_release` on Github which creates a GitHub release, tags it, and uploads release artefacts.\r\n- Adds a `release_diff` workflow which creates a simple markdown report between the latest release and the current one.\r\n- Adds a feature to directly support SSSOM mapping files, both in components and as standalone ([example](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/tests/test-sssom.yaml)). This allows to curate, for example, SSSOM mapping files in tables and them release them as part of the general release process. It also allows extracting mappings from inside the Ontology automatically using the SSSOM toolkit.\r\n- Changes in the `src/ontology/run.sh` wrapper script:\r\n  - [It is now possible](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/640) to execute the Docker image through [Singularity](https://apptainer.org).\r\n  - The `IMAGE` variable, which can used to specify an alternative ODK image, [has been renamed](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/655) to `ODK_IMAGE`.\r\n  - A new variable `ODK_TAG` has been introduced, allowing to specify an alternative tag (default is `latest`). A tag may also be specified directly as part of the `ODK_IMAGE` variable (as in `ODK_IMAGE=odkfull:v1.3.1`).\r\n  - A new variable `ODK_BINDS` has been introduced, allowing to specify extra bindings between a directory on the host computer and a directory inside the Docker container.\r\n  - Variables used by the `run.sh` script can now be set in a `src/ontology/run.sh.conf` file, which will be sourced by the wrapper script.\r\n  - With the config file option `use_env_file_docker`, if true, you can pass your local environment to the docker container. It is _strongly advised_ to add `run.sh.env` to `.gitignore` before using this feature. Committing your environment to git may reveal passcodes and other private information!\r\n\r\n### The GitHub issues dealt with as part of this release\r\n\r\n* Fix redundant filter in sparql queries

        "description": "## Official Changelog:\r\n\r\n- [Update to ROBOT 1.9.0](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/621), see [ROBOT release notes](https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/tag/v1.9.0). One major change concerning ODK: the [OBOGraphs JSON serialiser](https://github.com/geneontology/obographs) has been updated significantly, which means obographs json files may look a bit different. Most important change: empty elements (xrefs) are no longer serialised.\r\n- Added shortcut make commands for recreating components: `recreate-components` and `recreate-%` ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/570)).\r\n- Added new shortcut command for fast releases: `make prepare_release_fast`.\r\n- New tools:\r\n  - [Ontology Access Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-access-kit), a python library for interacting with ontologies, the the ODK ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/586)).\r\n  - [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli): GitHub CLI for running releases, createing pull requests and more\r\n  - [j2cli](https://github.com/kolypto/j2cli): Jinja template client\r\n  - [rdftab](https://github.com/ontodev/rdftab.rs): RDF Tables with Rust\r\n  - [gizmos](https://github.com/ontodev/gizmos): Python utilities for ontology development\r\n  - Other: obographviz, node.js, graphviz, npm\r\n- The ontology diff GitHub action, a tool that allows you to create diffs for you ontology pull requests, is now automatically synced with your ODK setup ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/564)).\r\n- Added `workflows` option to ODK config. This allows users to choose which workflows (at the moment GitHub actions-based) should be automatically synchronised.\r\n- Custom ROBOT SPARQL reports now consider the imports by default ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/570))\r\n- [Base IRIs can now be configured for ROBOT report, similar to what OBO Dashboard does](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/609/files)\r\n- Technical\r\n   - Run internal `make` and $(MAKE) to ensure that parameters are propagated correctly ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/554)).\r\n   - Mirror goal is only run when mirrors have been downloaded ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/570))\r\n   - src/ontology/run.sh can now be configured with a ODK_JAVA_OPTS parameter at runtime, rather than just with a `robot_java_args` option in the projects ODK config file. This allows to more easily run releases across environments with different levels of memory. Example: `ODK_JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx4G ODK_DEBUG=yes ./run.sh make odkversion`\r\n   - src/ontology/run.sh warns the user in certain cases to update their local ODK image.\r\n   - Better [linebreaks in Makefile](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/612) to make lines more.\r\n- Documentation\r\n   - [Added improved `CONTRIBUTING.md` to ODK repo template](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/620)\r\n   - [Removed history.md page from ODK documentation](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/611)\r\n   - [Some improved settings to default mkdocs documentation pages](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/605), such as better search, edit buttons and more.\r\n   - Some improved documentation on components ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/577))\r\n   - All ODK-related general docs now moved to https://oboacademy.github.io/obook.\r\n   - DOSDP documentation pages are now only created when dosdp is configured.\r\n- Bugs\r\n   - The automatic docs workflow now correctly `uses: mhausenblas/mkdocs-deploy-gh-pages@master`.\r\n   - In ODK 1.3.0 `prepare_release` depended on `all`, which caused some cyclicity for some customised setups. This is now changed to a separate `all_odk` goal.\r\n   - Simple ontology release artefacts now correctly depend on the `simple seed`.\r\n   - Similar to subset declarations, ODK now injects synonymtype declarations when extracting a module.\r\n   - diff.yaml no longer [added by default](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/588), has to be configured.\r\n\r\nFor changes on previous versions see complete [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\n\r\n## Automated GitHub Changelog:\r\n\r\n* Make sure diff.yml action is automatically copied during update by @shawntanzk in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/564\r\n* Update dosdp-tools to 0.19.2 by @balhoff in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/575\r\n* added components doc by @shawntanzk in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/577\r\n* Removed files that are repeated in obook by @shawntanzk in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/578\r\n* Add oaklib by @gouttegd in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/586\r\n* First fixes 131: components, $(MAKE) and reports by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/570\r\n* Build rdftab from source. by @gouttegd in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/593\r\n* Improving run.sh.jinja2 by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/594\r\n* Adding missing ontology annotations on imports by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/597\r\n* Update dosdp-tools version by @balhoff in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/596\r\n* issue 589 by @cmungall in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/590\r\n* Add ontodev-gizmos, psycopg2, pyspellchecker. by @gouttegd in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/602\r\n* Fix argument passing in the Windows run.bat script. by @gouttegd in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/603\r\n* ont.is_large only makes sense with module type slme by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/607\r\n* Upgrade base system by @gouttegd in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/604\r\n* Add ability to set base IRIs for report in ODK by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/609\r\n* [WIP] Update contribution guidelines by @cthoyt in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/598\r\n* Add Robot 1.9.0 to Dockerfile by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/621\r\n* Removing History page and add nice default config for mkdocs by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/611\r\n* New contribution guide by @matentzn in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/620\r\n* Add break lines to makefile by @anitacaron in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/612\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @cthoyt made their first contribution in https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/598\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/compare/v1.3.0...v1.3.1",

        "description": "# v1.3.0 (24 February 2022)\r\n\r\nAs always, update your local ODK with `docker pull obolibrary/odkfull`.\r\n\r\n### Breaking change for users of DOSDP in CI (GitHub Actions)\r\n\r\nA new tool was introduced for users of DOSDP for better validation. See this [comment](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/563#issuecomment-1049716367) about updating your CI pipeline.\r\n\r\n### New features:\r\n\r\n- _New DOSDP workflow for matching patterns_: This is a powerful workflow that \"matches\" your DOSDP YAML templates against your ontology to actually _create_ TSVs - so the other way around of what we usually do.\r\n  - To set this up, you introduce a new \"pattern_pipelines_group\" called `matches`, which can then be invoked with `sh run.sh make dosdp-matches-%` to match all configured DOSDP tempates with the ontology.\r\n  - Example see [here](tests/test-dosdp-matches.yaml).\r\n- _Experimental feature-diff feature_: When creating a pull request, the ODK can now automatically make a comment to the pull request informing editors of changes to the ontology ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/547))\r\n- _Adding [Relation Graph](https://github.com/balhoff/relation-graph/) to ODK_ ([pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/535), [pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/529))\r\n- _New QC checks_: \r\n  - _IRIs in labels_: Often when using autogenerated labels in DOSDP we do not realise we are accidentally missing labels to for generating class names. We introduced a QC check to protect against that ([pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/542/files), [issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/536))\r\n  - Ensuring that the range of  never_in_taxon:, present_in_taxon: , oboInOwl:inSubset, rdfs:seeAlso, foaf:depicted_by and dcterms:contributor is always IRI ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/520), [pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/527/files))\r\n- Switched the default Ontology documentation theme from `readthedocs` to `material` ([pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/530/files))\r\n- New [DOSDP tools version 0.19.1](https://github.com/INCATools/dosdp-tools/releases/tag/v0.19.1)\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n- Many faulty dependencies in the Makefile that triggered unnecessary re-runs of make were removed ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/448))\r\n- Some major refactoring of the main `Makefile` ([pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/530/files)). This includes, in particular, a smarter way to deal with web-dependencies (mirrors, dosdp-templates, components).\r\n- Fixes to documentation ([Managing dependencies with base files](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/514), [Import seed system](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/519))\r\n- Some fixes to DOSDP pipeline setup ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/490))\r\n- Git `main` branch was hardcoded to `master` during the seeding process, now uses the ODK config file ([pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/541), [issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/508))\r\n- Making sure the repo seeding process preserves file privileges. This ensures, in particular, that `run.sh` is executable and can be run using `./run.sh` instead of `sh run.sh` ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/196), [pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/538))\r\n- DOSDP Validation now [uses python up to date library](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/515)\r\n- Auto-deployment of ODK docs fixed (ODK internal, [pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/517)), but much of ODK's docs has moved to [OBOOK (OBO Academy)](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/)\r\n- Fixing some issues with default values when using `robot_report` in your ODK config ([pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/558))\r\n\r\n### New commands:\r\n- `sh run.sh make help`: show frequently used ODK commands and their usage ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/531))\r\n- `sh run.sh make TSV=my.tsv validate-tsv`: Experimental TSV validation feature with [TSValid](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/532) ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/375))\r\n- `sh run.sh make validate-all-tsv`: Validate all TSV tables configured in repo with [TSValid](https://github.com/ontodev/tsvalid) ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/375))\r\n- `sh run.sh make dosdp-matches-%`: Run the \"matches\" pipeline, see above. ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/540))\r\n- `sh run.sh make clean`: Clean up some temporary files created by the build. ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/300))\r\n\r\n### Recommendations for ontology maintainers:\r\n\r\n- We have overhauled the SPARQL query management to make it more customisable ([pull request](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/523)). We recommend, before updating to the latest ODK, to delete old and potentially stale SPARQL queries like this: `rm ../sparql/owldef-violation.sparql ../sparql/nolabels-violation.sparql ../sparql/def-lacks-xref-violation.sparql ../sparql/obsolete-violation.sparql ../sparql/redundant-subClassOf-violation.sparql`.\r\n- You should periodically review the contents of your `src/ontology/custom.Makefile` - if you overwrite a lot of goals, you should review wether the overwrite is still necessary. This ODK release has a lot of revisions to the Makefile, so this should be a good opportunity to check this!\r\n",

        "description": "_Attention: breaking changes below!_\r\n\r\n- Updated to [ROBOT 1.8.2](https://github.com/ontodev/robot/releases/tag/v1.8.2)\r\n- Updated to [DOSDP tools 0.18](https://github.com/INCATools/dosdp-tools/releases/tag/v0.18)\r\n- Adding `use_base_merging` to config files, which _enables the BASE file pipeline_, a completely different way to handle imports. This feature is not ready for primetime, but if you are interested in testing this, get in touch. For more details read ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files)).\r\n- Adding back [ssh/scp](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/494)\r\n- Migrated to Java 11 as the base Java in ODK ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/492))\r\n- Adding `make_base` feature that allows to autogenerate base files from ontologies where they do not exist ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files))\r\n- Adding new command `sh run.sh make no-mirror-refresh-imports` which refreshes imports without refreshing mirrors. Can be used for individual ontologies as well.\r\n- Making `owltools` where necessary configurable with a bespoke memory parameter ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/487))\r\n- Fixing the GitHub action to auto-deploy the documentation ([pr](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/485)).\r\n- Fixed a bug where the [DOSDP pages in ODK where generated in the wrong part](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files) of the mkdocs documentation.\r\n- New command `sh run.sh make explain_unsat` which generates a nicely formatted set of explanations for your unsatisfiable classes ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/493/files))\r\n- Adding method to [measure the memory consumption of your builds](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/495). For example, you can now run `IMAGE=odklite ODK_DEBUG=yes ./run.sh make prepare_release` to run your release on the (much lighter) `odklite` container of ODK, and get a nice benchmark summary at the end: \r\n```\r\n\r\n### DEBUG STATS ###\r\nElapsed time: 7:49.24\r\nPeak memory: 6517356 kb\r\n```\r\n- _Breaking changes_:\r\n  - Imported modules are no longer generated in OBO format automatically (only OWL). This reflects the fact that in most ontologies, even those where the editors file is in OBO format, imported ontologies are usually in OWL format. You can use the `export_obo` option to add them back  ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/496/files))\r\n  - Equivalent class default setting changed from `all` to `asserted only` ([pull](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/497)). This means that from now on, if you dont change the setting deliberately, your pipeline will fail if their are equivalent classes that are not deliberately asserted.\r\n  - OWL 2 DL profile checking is now `true` by [default](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/481). You have to actively switch it off by setting `ensure_owl2dl_profile` to `FALSE` in your config file. \r\n\r\nTo update to the latest version of ODK:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker pull obolibrary/odkfull\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo mirgate your repository to the latest version of ODK:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd myont/src/ontology\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo #(needs to be run twice since the update process also updates the update process.)\r\n```",

        "description": "- Important: The way we install python packages has changed significantly: we are now using _fixed version dependencies_ ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/463)). If there are problems with the versions of packages we are using, please let us know immediately.\r\n- We are now using multi-stage builds in ODK for docker. The `obolibrary/odklite` container is considerably lighter (smaller) than the normal `odkfull` container you have been using so far, and it should be sufficient for most ODK pipelines.\r\n- Mirrors are now downloaded with CURL instead of ROBOT, and configurable with `mirror_retry_download` and `mirror_max_time_download` in the `import_group` section of the ODK config file ([PR](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/pull/474)). *Note that the default `mirror_max_time_download` is 200 sec (a bit more than 3 minutes), which may be tight for some huge ontologies*.\r\n- odkfull now includes Souffl\u00e9.\r\n- For those who are using DOSDP patterns we re-introduced the pattern schema check even if pattern generation is skipped (it is very fast).\r\n- Created a simple way to cite ODK from within GitHub, using the CITATION.cff file. If you go to https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit, you will now see a \"cite this repo\" section under the *About* section.\r\n- Changed the default README.md to include a better reference to ODK, the correct ontology description text and the correct edit file extension.\r\n- Added a GitHub action to deploy the ODK-based mkdocs documentation ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/478)).\r\n- Created a [page](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/blob/master/docs/FrequentlyUsedODKCommands.md) for frequently used ODK commands.\r\n- Bugfixes:\r\n  - project repo name was not read correctly during `make update_repo` causing it to be named \"False\" ([commit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/commit/856a7f63c6b24b614eeae07deaf8ef1724903473))\r\n  - Fixed a bug where mirrors were not considered precious\r\n  - Fixed a bug where where the report directories where not created when running a sparql report command ([commit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/commit/dc1bb2220b978ed9adfb7cf9d2924ea6224945e3))\r\n  - Fixed a bug where `report` command incorrectly did not include components in the check ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/447))\r\n  - Fixed a bug where myont-odk.yaml was not created when using command line mode during seeding ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/384))\r\n  - Added some tests for external tools ([issue](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/472)) to ODK built process\r\n  - Konclude now works on the arm64 variant.",

Direct support for MIREOT and a new module type, minimal.\r\n  - To encourage stable versions and releases, ODK, by default, merges imports into the release files. Previously, we continued to release the imports as well - which we do not recommend anymore. If you still wish to release your imports as usual, you can set a flag `release_imports` in the `import_group` section of your makefile (see [example](tests/test-release.yaml)).\r\n  - the same as the above applies for reports (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n  - The custom sparql checks, and the custom sparql exports, are now directly configurable\r\n    - `custom_sparql_checks` : Chose which additional sparql checks you want to run. The related sparql query must be named CHECKNAME-violation.sparql, and be placed in the src/sparql directory (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n    - `custom_sparql_exports` : Chose which additional sparql checks you want to run. The related sparql query must be named CHECKNAME-violation.sparql, and be placed in the src/sparql directory (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n    - `custom_sparql_exports` : Chose which custom reports to generate. The related sparql query must be named CHECKNAME.sparql, and be placed in the src/sparql directory (see [example](tests/test-robot-report.yaml))\r\n  - `git_main_branch` : The `main` branch for your repo, default `main`, or (now discouraged, previously) `master`.\r\n  - `ci`: continuous integration defaults; currently available: `travis`, `github_actions`\r\n  - `create_obo_metadata`: This is mainly for new OBO ontologies. If true, OBO Markdown and PURL configs are created.\r\n  - `export_project_yaml`: Default `False`. If set to `True`, project.yaml is created in the top level of the repo.\r\n- Removed a few files from the standard config. This is all part of an effort to slimming down the ODK to the least number of necessary files checked into version control: `src/ontology/Dockerfile`,`src/ontology/patterns.sh`, `src/ontology/release.sh`, `src/ontology/test.sh`, and some temporary files. The `patterns` directory and all its contents only appear now when `use_dosdps`=TRUE.\r\n- Technical:\r\n  - Refactored ODK Dockerfile (merged some layers)\r\n  - added jq 1.6 which is not available via apt-get (yet).\r\n  - added sssom python package, but its in so alpha-alpha state, it should be used with caution",

        "description": "Some hotfixes and a features added to v.1.2.26 release (all pertaining to ODK repo template, not the tools)\r\n\r\n- Hotfixes:\r\n  - The new mireot module technique was buggy and is therefore removed again. Sorry; we will try again next time. You can still use the `custom` option to implement mireot yourself!\r\n  - A change in the way imports were processed introduced a very high memory footprint for large ontologies and slowed stuff down. If you do not have a lot of memory (and time!) available, you should use the following new flags: `is_large` and `use_gzipped`. `is_large: TRUE` introduces a special handling for the ontology that is faster and consumes less memory when creating an import. Using `use_gzipped` will try to download the ontology from its gzipped location.

Now changed to `BOT` as it was.\r\n  - CI configs where not correctly copied by update routine. Now it does. Note for the changes to be picked up, you need to run `sh run.sh make update_repo` twice (once for updating the update script itself)!\r\n  - Geeky (but necessary) all phony make goals are now correctly declared as `.PHONY`.\r\n- Some last minute features:\r\n  - In new repos, the README.md is now generated with the correct, appropriate banners.\r\n  - We now have a new feature, `custom_makefile_header`, that allows injecting a custom header into the Makefile. Most mortals wont need this, but this is how it goes:\r\n```\r\ncustom_makefile_header: |\r\n  ### Workflow\r\n  #\r\n  # Tasks to edit and release OMRSE.\r\n  #\r\n  # #### Edit\r\n  #\r\n  # 1.

OBO versions are only generated if OBO is used as the edit file serialisation.\r\n  - PAT=false now skips pattern download\r\n- Fixes to DOSDP pipeline\r\n  - DOSDP tools is updated to version 0.14. This version comes with some great changes, including:\r\n    - a mode in which multiple patterns can be compiled at once (batch mode)\r\n    - we finally have have optional columns and column values!\r\n  - external.txt can now be empty\r\n  - instead of abnormalAnatomicalEntity, an example.yaml is added to the default pattern directory\r\n- Infrastructure (only relevant to ODK developers):\r\n  - The test framework for ODK is now more dynamic: \r\n    1. Travis now correctly builds the ODK from scratch and runs the tests against the new build version\r\n    1. Instead of adding new tests to the Makefile, you can simply now drop a new YAML file into the tests/ directory.\r\n  - ODK Dockerfile has been optimised a bit for size (avoiding superfluous chmod calls)\r\n  - the yaml loader in the ODK is now replaced by a safe loader",

        "value": "*Note: this is an _highly experimental_ feature as of ODK version 1.2.24. Note that the display and the scores are under active development and will change considerably in the near future.*\n\nExample implementation: \n- https://github.com/obophenotype/obophenotype.github.io ([web](https://obophenotype.github.io/dashboard/index.html))\nYou need two files to run the ODK dashboard generator:\n\n1. An ODK container wrapper (called `odk.sh` in the following), similar to the `run.sh` file in your typical repos `src/ontology` directory.\n2. A dashboard config YAML file (called `dashboard-config.yml` in the following)\n\nWith both files, you can then create a dashboard using the following command:\n\n```\nsh odk.sh obodash -C dashboard-config.yml\n```\n\nThe wrapper (`odk.sh`) should contain something like the following:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\n# Wrapper script for ODK docker container.\n#\ndocker run -e ROBOT_JAVA_ARGS='-Xmx4G' -e JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx4G' \\\n  -v $PWD/dashboard:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard \\\n  -v $PWD/dashboard-config.yml:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/dashboard-config.yml \\\n  -v $PWD/ontologies:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/build/ontologies \\\n  -v $PWD/sparql:/tools/OBO-Dashboard/sparql \\\n  -w /work --rm -ti obolibrary/odkfull \"$@\"\n```\n\nNote that this essentially binds a few local directories to the running ODK container. The directories serve the following purposes:\n\n1. `dashboard`: this is where the dashboard is deposited. Look at index.html in your browser.\n2. `ontologies`: this is where ontologies are downloaded to and synced up\n3. `sparql`: an optional directory that allows you to add custom checks on top of the usual OBO profile.\n\nThis is a minimal example dashboard config for a potential phenotype dashboard:\n\n```\ntitle: OBO Phenotype Dashboard\ndescription: Quality control for OBO phenotype ontologies. Under construction.\nontologies:\n  custom:\n    - id: wbphenotype\n    - id: dpo\n      base_ns:\n        - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv\nenvironment:\n  ROBOT_JAR: /tools/robot.jar\n  ROBOT: robot\n``` \n\nThe ontologies will, if they exist, be retrieved from their OBO purls and evaluated. There are more options potentially of interest:\n\n```\ntitle: OBO Phenotype Dashboard\ndescription: Quality control for OBO phenotype ontologies. Under construction.\nontologies:\n  custom:\n    - id: myont\n      mirror_from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obophenotype/c-elegans-phenotype-ontology/master/wbphenotype-base.owl\n    - id: dpo\n      base_ns:\n        - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv\nprefer_base: True\nprofile:\n  baseprofile: \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ontodev/robot/master/robot-core/src/main/resources/report_profile.txt\"\n  custom:\n    - \"WARN\\tfile:./sparql/missing_xrefs.sparql\"\nreport_truncation_limit: 300\nredownload_after_hours: 2\nenvironment:\n  ROBOT_JAR: /tools/robot.jar\n  ROBOT: robot\n``` \n\n- `mirror_from` allows specifying a download URL other than the default OBO purl\n- `base_ns` allows specifying the set of namespaces considered to be _owned_ by the ontology (only terms in these namespaces will be evaluated for this ontology. Default is http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CAPTIALISEDONTOLOGYID).\n- `report_truncation_limit` allows truncating long (sometimes HUGE ontology reports) to make them go easier on GITHUB version control.\n- `redownload_after_hours`: this allows to specify how long to wait before trying to download an ontology (which could be a time consuming process!) again.\n- `environment`: is currently a necessary parameter but will be made optional in future versions. It allows adding environment variables directly to the config, rather than passing them in as -e parameters to the docker container (both are equivalent though.)\n- `profile` is an optional parameter that allows specifying your own profile for the quality control (ROBOT) report. By default, this is using the ROBOT report default profile. You can either specify your own profile from scratch, or extend the current default with additional test by using the `baseprofile` parameter. Find out more about ROBOT profiles [here](http://robot.obolibrary.org/report#profiles).\n\nA fully working example can be found [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/obophenotype.github.io).\n"
