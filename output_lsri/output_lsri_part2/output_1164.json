It uses a simple command line interface and is configured via a single configuration file.\nIt automatically uses the available ressources on the machine it runs on while still providing the option\nto use less if desired. All modules can be run on their own or as a comprehensive workflow.\n\nA graphical user interface version for apscale is available [here](https://github.com/TillMacher/apscale_gui).\n\nPrograms used:\n* vsearch (PE merging, quality filtering, otu clustering, denoising) (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)\n* cutadapt (primer trimming) (https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt)\n* lulu (implemented in python for apscale) (https://github.com/tobiasgf/lulu)\n\nInput:\n* demultiplexed gzipped reads\n\nOutput:\n* log files, project report, OTU/ESV table\n"

For example, for COI sequences,\nBOLDigger (https://github.com/DominikBuchner/BOLDigger) can be used directly with the output of Apscale to assign taxonomy to the OTUs / ESVs using the Barcode of Life Data system (BOLD) database.

Its default value is 6 since this is the default value of gzip.\nThe higher the compression level, the longer Apscale will take to process the data and vice versa, so if runtime is an issue, you can\nlower the compression level and if disk space is a concern, the compression level can be set to 9 as maximum value.\n"
