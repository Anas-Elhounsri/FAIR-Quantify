Commercial use requires a commercial license from the Spanish\nNational Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), www.cnio.es.\n\nACADEMIC PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nCopyright (C) 2021 Coral Fustero-Torre, Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez-Santos,\nSantiago Garc\u00eda-Mart\u00edn, Carlos Carretero-Puche, Luis Garc\u00eda-Jimeno,\nTom\u00e1s Di Domenico, Gonzalo G\u00f3mez-L\u00f3pez and F\u00e1tima Al-Shahrour\n\n\nPreamble\n\nThis license contains the terms and conditions of using Beyondcell in\nnoncommercial settings: at academic institutions for teaching and research use,\nand at non-profit research organizations. You will find that this license\nprovides noncommercial users of Beyondcell with rights that are similar to the\nwell-known GNU General Public License, yet it retains the possibility for\nBeyondcell authors to financially support the development by selling commercial\nlicenses. In fact, if you intend to use Beyondcell in a \"for-profit\"\nenvironment, where research is conducted to develop or enhance a product, is\nused in a commercial service offering, or when a commercial company uses\nBeyondcell to participate in a research project (for example government-funded\nor EU-funded research projects), then you need to obtain a commercial license\nfor Beyondcell. In that case, please contact the Author (falshahrour@cnio.es)\nto inquire about commercial licenses.\n\nWhat are the rights given to noncommercial users? Similarly to GPL, you have\nthe right to use the software, to distribute copies, to receive source code, to\nchange the software and distribute your modifications or the modified software.\nAlso similarly to the GPL, if you distribute verbatim or modified copies of\nthis software, they must be distributed under this license.\n\nBy modeling the GPL, this license guarantees that you're safe when using\nBeyondcell in your work, for teaching or research. This license guarantees that\nBeyondcell will remain available free of charge for nonprofit use. You can\nmodify Beyondcell to your purposes, and you can also share your modifications.\nEven in the unlikely case of the authors abandoning Beyondcell entirely, this\nlicense permits anyone to continue developing it from the last release, and to\ncreate further releases under this license.\n\nWe believe that the combination of noncommercial open-source and commercial\nlicensing will be beneficial for the whole user community, because income from\ncommercial licenses will enable faster development and a higher level of\nsoftware quality, while further enjoying the informal, open communication and\ncollaboration channels of open source development.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for using, copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nACADEMIC PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. Definitions\n\n\"Program\" means a copy of Beyondcell, which is said to be distributed under\nthis Academic Public License.\n\n\"Work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work\nunder copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion\nof it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".)\n\n\"Using the Program\" means any act of creating executables that contain or\ndirectly use libraries that are part of the Program, running any of the tools\nthat are part of the Program, or creating works based on the Program.\n\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n1. Permission is hereby granted to use the Program free of charge for any\nnoncommercial purpose, including teaching and research at universities,\ncolleges and other educational institutions, research at non-profit research\ninstitutions, and personal non-profit purposes. For using the Program for\ncommercial purposes, including but not restricted to consulting activities,\ndesign of commercial hardware or software networking products, and a commercial\nentity participating in research projects, you have to contact the Author for\nan appropriate license. Permission is also granted to use the Program for a\nreasonably limited period of time for the purpose of evaluating its usefulness\nfor a particular purpose.\n\n2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 2 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\nthat you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\nin part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\nLicense.\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose regulations for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. (If the\nsame, independent sections are distributed as part of a package that is\notherwise reliant on, or is based on the Program, then the distribution of the\nwhole package, including but not restricted to the independent section, must be\non the unmodified terms of this License, regardless of who the author of the\nincluded sections was.)\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based or\nreliant on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 3) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 2 and\n3 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\ncode, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 2 and 3 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\ngive any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\nperforming source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\ncorresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 2 and\n3 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\nnoncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\nor executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b) above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nNothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its\nderivative works; law prohibits these actions if you do not accept this\nLicense. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based\non the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms\nand conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works\nbased on it, to do so.\n\n7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program are restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of\nthis License.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n10. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU\nASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n11. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED ON IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nNOTE In case the above text differs from the license file in the source\ndistribution, the latter is the valid one.\n"
