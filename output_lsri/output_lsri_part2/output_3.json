Each chain is then processed to identify whether the enzymes are encoded by any metabolic  operons within bacterial genomes, and putative transcriptional regulators of the operons are predicted and scored based upon a conceptual model of how TFBs are frequently genetically organized. TFBMiner also has an option for predicting TFBs that regulate single genes, rather than genes encoding enzymatic chains.\n \n"
