The default setting is to perform multi-objective binding affinity maximiziation with the filtering step, but other properties can be optimized by specifying `--prop` (see \"Training the property predictor\" to optimize your own properties). Model files for penalized logP, binding affinity to ESR1 and ACAA1, QED, and SA are provided in the `property_models` folder. The default binding affinity model is ESR1 (which is `binding_affinity.pt`), but to optimize binding to another protein one must make sure the `binding_affinity.pt` file contains the model for that correct protein. For example, for 2IIK binding optimization one must remove/rename the original `binding_affinity.pt` file and rename `2iik_binding_affinity.pt` to `binding_affinity.pt`. A trained VAE model is provided that was trained on the ZINC250K dataset, but any SMILES dataset can be used for training (see \"Training the VAE\"). \nTo optimize molecules for binding affinity, an AutoDock-GPU executable [must be compiled](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU#compilation), and pointed to with the `--autodock_executable` flag when generating molecules, training the property predictor, or fine-tuning. A `--protein_file` must also be specified, but files for ESR1 (`1err/1err.maps.fld`) and ACAA1 (`2iik/2iik.maps.fld`) are already supplied. To generate your own protein files, see Steps 1-2 in the [AutoDock4 User Guide](https://autodock.scripps.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2021/10/AutoDock4.2.6_UserGuide.pdf). The [AutoDock-GPU Wiki](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU/wiki/Guideline-for-users) may also be helpful.\n \n"

For properties other than binding affinity, we suggest training with `--num_mols 100000` for greater prediction accuracy. The printed `r` value should be >0.5 for most properties (except binding affinity, which is typically a lower value because it is a more difficult task), so running multiple times until you reach a suitable `r` value or training with more molecules is recommended.\n \n"
