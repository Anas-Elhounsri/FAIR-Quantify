Translating the success of such breakthroughs in diagnostics to affordable solutions for low-cost healthcare requires development of algorithms that can operate on the edge instead of in the cloud, using low-cost and low-power electronic systems such as microcontrollers and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

EdgeAlign uses deep reinforcement learning to train a deep Q-network (DQN) agent for performing sequence alignment on fixed length sub-sequences, using a sliding window that is scanned over the length of the entire sequence. The hardware resource-consumption for implementing this scheme is thus independent of the lengths of the sequences to be aligned, and is further optimized using a novel AutoML based method for neural network model size reduction.
