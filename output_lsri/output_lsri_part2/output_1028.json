        "value": "<b>Gluclas</b> (GLUcose CLamp ASsistant) is a free software for suggesting glucose infusion rate adjustments during manual glucose clamp experiments.  \n## Disclaimer\n<b>Gluclas</b> is not an approved medical software nor a medical device. It should be considered as an investigational tool aimed at providing infusion rate suggestions that must be critically interpreted, reviewed, and verified by the clinician in charge of conducting the experiment, who remains the ultimate responsible for clinical decisions. The authors of this software decline any responsibility for medical consequences of inadequate suggestions. \n## Requirements\n<b>Gluclas</b> is developed in MATLAB\u00ae, but no license is required to run the software. All <b>Gluclas</b> requires is the MATLAB\u00ae Runtime (v. 9.11 or higher) to be installed in your computer.  \nYou can download the appropriate version of the MATLAB\u00ae Runtime for your OS [here](https://it.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). \n## Software description\nThe two main components of <b>Gluclas</b> are a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm, which is used to compute GIR suggestions, and a Graphic User Interface (GUI) for data recording, visualization, and correction. An extensive description of the control algorithm can be found in [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260722004850?via%3Dihub). The GUI is minimalistic, and the computation cost of the control algorithm is negligible \u2013 which reduces the hardware requisites for running the software. \n  \n### Starting and protocol settings\nWhen starting a new experiment, a \u201cSettings\u201d window requests information about the subject and the protocol of the experiment. The \u201cPatient data\u201d section collects patients characteristics. The \u201cType of clamp\u201d section allows to choose between one of three different GC types: \u201cHypoglycemic\u201d, \u201cEuglycemic\u201d and \u201cHyperglycemic\u201d. To help the user, the fields in the \u201cProtocol settings\u201d section are pre-filled with default settings based on the type of clamp and patient\u2019s information. \n  \nDepending on the type of GC, different reference signals are proposed: a constant reference of 12.4 mmol/l for the \u201cHyperglycemic\u201d, a constant reference of 5.5 mmol/l for the \u201cEuglycemic\u201d or a time-varying reference that slowly reaches 2.5 mmol/l for the \u201cHypoglycemic\u201d. In the \u201cEuglycemic\u201d and \u201cHypoglycemic\u201d clamp, the \u201cInsulin solution infusion rate\u201d is precompiled to suggest an infusion rate of 40 mU/ m2/min per body surface area (m2). Body surface area (BSA) is computed using the Du Bois formula. These pre-defined values are commonly used in literature and can be over-written by the user to fully customize the protocol. \n  \nThe \u201cAdvanced settings\u201d button opens a new window where the user can specify the desired measurement units for BG concentration (\u201cmmol/l\u201d or \u201cmg/dl\u201d). In GC experiments, glucose and insulin are infused using volumetric pumps. For this reason, the \u201cAdvance settings\u201d windows allow the user to specify the concentration of glucose and insulin in the solutions. Glucose concentration will later be used to suggest GIR adjustments in ml/h. \n  \n### Reading and control\nOnce patient\u2019s data are provided and experimental settings are defined, the user can access to the \u201cExperiment\u201d window. The time of acquisition of all the measurements is provided and recorded as the number of minutes passed since the start of the experiment. Users can set the beginning of this timer by clicking on the \u201cCalibrate time\u201d button. By clicking on \u201cStart Reading\u201d, the software will enter the \u201cReading mode\u201d, which consists exclusively in monitoring and recording subjects\u2019 BG levels. In this mode, a pop-up window will appear every 5 minutes to ask the investigator for a BG measurement. If no measurement is provided within 5 minutes, the pop-up window will automatically close. \n  \nWhen the button \u201cControl to reference\u201d is clicked, the experiment enters in the \u201cControl mode\u201d. From this moment, the pop-up window will also return a suggested GIR, as shown in Figure 6. If the investigator decides to use a different GIR from the one suggested by the controller, then the correct GIR should be reported here in the field \u201cActual GIR\u201d. This pop-up window will also appear every 5 minutes for nudging the users to comply with the sampling period. \n  \nLastly, when the button \u201cRestore euglycemia\u201d is clicked, the reference signal will be over-written with 4.5 mmol/l. This mode can be particularly useful to bring patient\u2019s BG to a physiological concentration after the completion of the experiment in the case of hypoglycemic clamp experiments.  \n \nIt is possible to record additional signals during the experiment (e.g., insulin, glucose intake, additional BG measurements). It is also possible to correct any inserted measurement. A backup file is updated at the end of any BG measurement to restore the experiment in case of unexpected interruptions of the program. \n  \nAt the end of the experiment, data can be saved automatically in both .mat and .xlsx format.  \n"

For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\ne. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\nf. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\nh. __Licensed Material__ means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\ni. __Licensed Rights__ means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\nh. __Licensor__ means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\ni. __NonCommercial__ means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.\n\nj. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\nk. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nl. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n### Section 2 \u2013 Scope.\n\na. ___License grant.___\n\n   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n        B. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n   2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n   4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. __Downstream recipients.__\n\n        A. __Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n        B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n   6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. ___Other rights.___\n\n   1.

Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\n\n### Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\na. ___Attribution.___\n\n   1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:\n\n      A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n         ii. a copyright notice;\n\n         iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n         iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n      B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n      C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n \n        For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under this Public License to Share Adapted Material.\n\n   2.

This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__\n\nb. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n### Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\nd.
