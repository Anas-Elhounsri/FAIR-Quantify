To install it, download [surehyp_cython_extra](https://github.com/tmiraglio/surehyp_cython_extra), navigate to the downloaded folder and run:\n\n```\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nIf this extra library is not installed, the program will revert to Scipy functions.\n\nTo obtain Earth Engine credentials and be able to download data from GEE, users can follow the steps described [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install-conda#get_credentials).\n\nTo obtain SMARTS, refer to [this section](https://github.com/tmiraglio/SUREHYP#third-party-softwares).\n"
