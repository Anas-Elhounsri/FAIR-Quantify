At the most basic level, it allows to represent high-order relationships between objects, with complete freedom to choose the type of these objects. A secondary aim follows from the realisation that most flavours of (hyper)graphs are a specific case of oriented, weighted hypergraphs; from this, it should be possible to define all methods at the hypergraph level and to programmatically specialise them for other (hyper)graph types. \nCurrently implemented are fundamental constructors for unoriented, unweighted hypergraphs (via the `HyperGraph` and `HyperEdge` types) and for a specific case of oriented, weighted hypergraphs: chemical hypergraphs (via the `ChemicalHyperGraph` and `ChemicalHyperEdge` types), as well as a set of functions that allow to modify hypergraphs (adding and deleting hyperedges and vertices). Flavours of hypergraphs and hyperedges are implemented with traits via [SimpleTraits.jl](https://github.com/mauro3/SimpleTraits.jl); traits implemented so far are `IsOriented` and `IsWeighted`. \n"

If custom field names are needed, these should be explicitly connected to core methods (`vertices` and `hyperedges` mainly). Currently, field names should be: \n- `V`, the set of vertices in a hypergraph and a hyperedge\n- `E`, the set of hyperedges in a hypergraph\n- `src`, the set of source vertices in an oriented hyperedge\n- `tgt`, the set of target vertices in an oriented hyperedge\n- `objs`, the objects of an incidence\n- `mults`, the multiplicities of the objects of an incidence\n- `w`, the weight of a weighted hyperedge \nThen, custom names are built on top e.g. `rate(e::ChemicalHyperEdge) = weight(e)` (which is already implemented). \nThese symbols were chosen to differentiate hypergraphs from graphs (all graphs are hypergraphs but not all hypergraphs are graphs), and so a hypergraph is defined as X = (V, E). An alternative option was to name hypergraphs with the letter H; however, following that logic would have meant changing the symbol for hyperedges too, which would have been impractical (also H). This way, using X emphasises the difference between hypergraphs and graphs and using E for edges retains some continuity with ordinary graphs notation G = (V, E). \n"

Following this more general definition gives us degree 2 for a loop (since a loop on v is twice incident on v [[Zaslavsky1982]](#Zaslavsky1982)) while working in the same way as the former definition in other cases. \nHere we implement an even more general definition of degree: the degree of vertex v is defined as _the sum of the weights of edges incident on v_, where the weight of edge e appears according to the multiplicity of v in e. In other words, the degree of v is given by the sum over edges of edge weight times the number of incidences of v in each edge. Other definitions discussed above are special cases of this more general definition. \nThis however means that `degree` may now return values that are not of type `Number`, depending on what type edge weights are. This may cause unexpected behaviours since some concepts rely on e.g. `maximum` or `sum` being defined on degree values. Those effectively assume that degrees are defined on the positive integers including zero. \n"

If the vertices of an edge are treated as a multiset or as an _n_-tuple (e.g. when working with oriented edges), a loop should have cardinality 2. This comes from the fact that a loop has two (coinciding) endpoints ([[Zaslavsky1982]](#Zaslavsky1982), [[Zaslavsky1991]](#Zaslavsky1991)), with the cardinality of a multiset being the sum of the multiplicities of its elements. If it is instead treated as a set, a loop has cardinality 1, as is often defined (e.g. in [[Dorfler1980]](#Dorfler1980), [[Berge1989]](#Berge1989), [[Bretto2013]](#Bretto2013)). Concisely, a loop has cardinality __2__ when counting its number of endpoints; __2__ when counting the number of elements of a multiset / _n_-tuple; __1__ when counting the number of elements of a set. This seems to be what is suggested on page 4 of  [[Spivak2009]](#Spivak2009): the map that sends the set of non-empty tuples on a set S (i.e. edges) to the set non-empty subsets of S (i.e. vertices) \"may decrease cardinality.\" The approach taken here is to adopt the most general definition (i.e. considering the vertices of edges as a multiset / an _n_-tuple) which then leaves freedom to build more specialised functions on top. \n"
