The approximate timing should be less than 1 min, less than 10 minutes and greater than 10 minutes, respectively.

The pipeline file path describes where in your Google Drive file system or local file system the pipeline is set up. The ACC variable specifies either the FASTQ file on your machine containing long-read sequencing data or the run accession number (e.g. [SRR12389274](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/SRR12389274)) for the publically available file which you wish to analyze.
