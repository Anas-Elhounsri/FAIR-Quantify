A better understanding of the biochemical rules governing TCR binding can be used, e.g. to guide the design of more powerful and safer T cell-based therapies. Advances in repertoire sequencing technologies have made available millions of TCR sequences. Data abundance has, in turn, fueled the development of many computational models to predict the binding properties of TCRs from their sequences. Unfortunately, while many of these works have made great strides toward predicting TCR specificity using machine learning, the black-box nature of these models has resulted in a limited understanding of the rules that govern the binding of a TCR and an epitope.We present an easy-to-use and customizable computational pipeline, DECODE, to extract the binding rules from any black-box model designed to predict the TCR-epitope binding. DECODE offers a range of analytical and visualization tools to guide the user in the extraction of such rules.
