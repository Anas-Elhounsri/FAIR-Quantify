Three main types of data can be retrieved using PAReTT:\n(1) Divergence times, between an individual pair or between all species in a list, (2) Evolutionary timelines, for individuals\nor a list species, and (3) Time trees of the divergence times, either for all available species within a specified taxon or\nbetween individual species supplied as a list.\nWhen working with a list of species, the best place to start is by using the first menu option to check the data availability \nof species in the list and removing any species for which data is not available. \n\n**Cite as:** Le Clercq L.S., Kotze A., Grobler J.P., and Dalton D.L.
