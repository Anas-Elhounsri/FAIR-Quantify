These files are provided so you could reference the file formats. However, the paucity of data in these files will cause Tangent to fail. Unfortunately, we do not currently provide a true sample BAM/coverage file.\n\nSolution: Please re-read Step 2 of this guide and supply your own SIF and coverage files. You can convert a .bam file to the coverage file using the GATK DepthOfCoverage tool (available on https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_coverage_DepthOfCoverage.php or as available on FireCloud https://portal.firecloud.org/).\n\nNote: If you are already supplying your own coverage files and are still receiving this error, please contact us at the email below so we could help with troubleshooting.\n"
