        "value": "Systems of Boolean Delay Equations (BDEs) \u2013 in which time is continuous but state is binary \u2013 are capable of generating surprisingly complex behaviour, despite their apparent simplicity [1,2]. In addition to simulating convergence to steady states, BDEs can also generate periodic and quasiperiodic oscillations, \ud835\udc5a:\ud835\udc5b frequency locking and even chaotic dynamics [3]. Furthermore, the enumerability of the Boolean update functions and the compact parametrisation resulting from discretisation means that BDE systems can be readily leveraged to generate low-level descriptions of physical systems, from which more quantitative model formulations (e.g. differential equations) can be constructed [4]. The utility of BDE modelling in this regard has been demonstrated in several fields, including computational biology and climate science [4-11], but the use of BDEs is still primarily restricted to a few research laboratories. In order to facilitate the wider adoption of the BDE formalism by the computational modelling community, BDEtools has been developed to enable researchers to construct, solve and analyse BDE systems in a straightforward fashion.\n"

These (parallel) solutions are stored in the cell <b>solcell</b> and also fed in as histories to the serial solver -- the serial solutions are returned in the cell  <b>solSercell</b>.
