        "value": "In this repository there is a file called `nextflow.config` that contains some important parameters to control how the pipeline is run.\n\nPerhaps the only line you need to look at initially is the `executor`, and possibly the `queue` line. The executor instructs nextflow about how to run the commands. Unless you are running analysis in the cloud, you will want to set `executor` to either `local` (to run all the commands on the current machine) or `slurm` to run all the jobs using a slurm scheduler. If you use `slurm` you want to run the nextflow command on your cluster head node and if you want to use a specific partition on your cluster you need to set `queue` appropriately. All of the available executors with instructions for what to put in the `nextflow.config` file are here: <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/executor.html>\n\n**To run the pipeline you can start with this command**:\n\n```shell\nnextflow run TMBur.nf\n    --samples_file /path/to/samples.csv\n    --out_dir ./TMB_out\n    -profile hg19\n```\n\n`--out_dir` will be where the final results are copied. During the run a folder called `work` will be created in the current directory that contains all of the intermediate files.\n\nSome parameters that you might want to use:\n\n1. These parameters will create some figures and reports about the resources used during the run `-with-report -with-timeline -with-trace`\n2. If you are on slurm and you notice that only 20ish jobs run at a time, try using `-qs 50` to allow up to 50 jobs to run at once.\n3. `-w /path/to/folder` can be used to have all of the intermidiate analysis files stored somewhere other than the `work` folder in the current directory.\n4. `-resume` can be used to pick up analysis where it left off. This is useful if for some reason something crashes at run time, using `-resume` will make sure that the analysis that was done upstream doesn't get re-run. If you want to add another sample or pair of fastq files to the CSV file after you have processed other samples `-resume` will ensure that only the new samples get analyzed.\n5. One of the Beta outputs includes a TMB estimate derived using a panel of common cancer genes. Users will need to provide their own COSMIC VCF file in the `nextflow.config` file.\n"
