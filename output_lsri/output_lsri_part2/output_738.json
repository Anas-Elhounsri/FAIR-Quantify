Open the training data menu with the corresponding button:\n\n![training data menu](doc/train_data_menu.png)\n\nPer default, only a maximum of 40% of the frames of an experiment and maximum 30 frames per experiment are used for the crop creation. The idea is to use no subsequent frames and create more crops from different experiments. However, for some cases, e.g. when only one experiment is available, it may make sense to extract crops from all frames. Therefore, the corresponding checkbox can be checked. \n\nThe pre-labeling option is only available if some trained models are available (see section below). Users can specify to which subset selected crops can be assigned (only relevant for experts, just keep the default if you do not know what that means). The crop creation is interactive and crops from different image areas (of the same frame) are proposed:\n\n![crop creation](doc/crop_creation.gif)\n\nCrops can be selected by clicking on the corresponding image or using shortcuts (1: first image, 2: second image, 3: third image, space: select/next).\n\nAfter the crop creation, the annotation tool can be opened and the crops can be annotated:\n\n![annotation](doc/annotation.png)\n\nRecommendation: Select a brush size as thick as your cells are if possible. Then, you can save some time. An annotation tutorial is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UMy6wnDnAU).\n\n"

Thereby, it can be specified if the images will be min-max normalized or keep their normalization and to which training data subset they are added (train, val, test). Then, the training data will be cropped and uploaded to OMERO into the selected training set.\n\nNote: images need to begin with \"img\", e.g., \"img001.tif\" and the corresponding ground truth masks with \"mask\", e.g., \"mask001.tif\". The file formats '.png', '.tiff', '.tif', '.jpeg' are supported. 2D+t images need to be saved as single frames to be able to be imported. An easy way to get the files into the required format is to open them in [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) (sequences with \"Import\" -> \"Image Sequence...\") and save them as \"Image Sequence...\" (with Name=img for images and Name=mask for segmentation masks).   \n\nThe selected training set can be exported from OMERO using the *Export* button. Not annotated images will be skipped. The exported training data are saved into the *training_dataset* folder.\n\n### Training\nIn the training menu, the batch size, how many models should be trained, the optimizer and the method can be selected:\n\n![training menu](doc/training_menu.png)\n\nThe maximum possible batch size depends on the available RAM/VRAM. Large batch sizes can reduce the training time. Small batch sizes result in less memory demand. *Adam* is always a good choice as optimizer, but we made good experiences with the *Ranger* optimizer. Best train some models with each optimizer. The *boundary* method serves as a simple baseline method. The default *distance* method outperforms the *boundary* methods for many cell types. After starting the training process, the training data are downloaded from OMERO, the boundary or distance labels are created and the training begins:\n\n![training](doc/training.png)\n\nWhen the model does not improve for a certain time or the maximum number of epochs (depends on the amount of available training samples and the crop size) is reached, the training finishes. The models are saved into the *models* folder. The used training set for each model is also saved there (for reproducibility and documentation since the OMERO training set may change over time, e.g., new crops are added).\n"

There is also the possibility to save the raw convolutional neural network outputs in addition to the instance segmentation masks. Evaluation results are saved into the *evaluation* folder.

After inference (and corrections), simple analysis results can be produced: cell counts, mean cell area in px\u00b2, total cell area in px\u00b2, mean major axis length in px and mean minor axis length in px for each frame. The analysis results are attached as csv file to the corresponding image on OMERO.
