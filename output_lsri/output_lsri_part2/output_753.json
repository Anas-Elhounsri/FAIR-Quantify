Make sure you will have enough disk space.\n\n\n#### Combinatorial Phenotypes Cell Counting\n\nThe following code snippet is considering the folder structure previously recommended. It will perform the pre-processing and the combinatorial phenotypes cell counting. It will generate two output files (\"combinatorial_phenotype_counts.csv\" and \"combinatorial_phenotypes.log\") in the `output_folder` indicated.\n\n``` r\n# File: phenoComb_script.R\n\nlibrary(PhenoComb)\n\n# Run the next two lines if you are running this script from RStudio\n# to change your working directory to where this file is. Comment/remove them\n# if you are running using Rscript.\nlibrary(\"rstudioapi\")\nsetwd(dirname(getActiveDocumentContext()$path))\n\n# Process raw data and generates all combinatorial phenotypes\ncombinatorial_phenotype_counts_server(cell_file = \"../inputs/cell_data.fcs\",\n                                      channel_file = \"../inputs/channel_data.csv\",\n                                      sample_file = \"../inputs/sample_data.csv\",\n                                      output_folder = \"../outputs\",\n                                      min_count = 10,\n                                      sample_fraction_min_counts = 0.5,\n                                      sampleID_col = \"Sample_ID\",\n                                      verbose = TRUE,\n                                      n_threads = 8\n)\n```\n\nThe verbose option will also print the logging to your default prompt. The `sampleID_col` parameter is the respective column in your `cell_file` containing the sample IDs matching the ones described in `sample_file`. The `min_count` option is the minimum number of cells a phenotype must have, and `sample_fraction_min_counts` is the fraction of the samples that must meet the `min_count` criterion. All phenotypes that do not match these minimum requirements will be discarded. Set the `n_threads` parameter to the desired number of threads to be used.\n\n\n#### Statistical Testing\n\nSimilarly to the local workflow, the statistical testing will evaluate all phenotypes computed in the last step accordingly to the specified statistical test. However, it will read the input from a file and output the results to another file. The following code snippet is an example of performing a group comparison statistical test:\n\n``` r\nstatistically_relevant_phenotypes_server(output_folder = \"../outputs\",\n                                         channel_file = \"../inputs/channel_data.csv\",\n                                         sample_file = \"../inputs/sample_data.csv\",\n                                         input_phenotype_counts = \"combinatorial_phenotype_counts.csv\",\n                                         input_phenotype_counts_log = \"combinatorial_phenotypes.log\",\n                                         output_file = \"significant_phenotypes.csv\",\n                                         log_file = \"significant_phenotypes.log\",\n                                         groups_column = \"Group\",\n                                         g1 = \"g1\",\n                                         g2 = \"g2\",\n                                         max_pval = 0.05,\n                                         verbose = TRUE,\n                                         n_threads = 8\n)\n```\n\nwhere `test_type` indicates a group comparison test, the `groups_column` is the respective column in `sample_data` where your grouping information is stored, and `g1` and `g2` are the values in `groups_column` to be considered for each group. The `max_pval` parameter will filter the outputs considering it as a maximum p-value.\n\nIf `input_phenotype_counts` and `input_phenotype_counts_log` are not provided, it will automatically search for them in the `output_folder`. However, if explicitly provided, it will make some of the processing faster. Consider using it when analyzing big datasets.\n\nThe `output_file` and `log_file` parameters ar optional, but it's a convenience when performing different group comparisons on the same dataset, for example. They will be stored into `output_folder`, **DO NOT** put the full path to a file here, only the file name.\n\n\n#### Independent Phenotypes Filtering\n\nDifferently from the previous two steps, this tool **is** limited by your machine's memory. To avoid any memory issues, choose a reasonable number of phenotypes to be considered using the `n_phenotypes` option. A reasonable number is 5000 to 10000 phenotypes. They will be selected from the input based on the smallest associated p-values. It will automatically detect the statistical test used in the previous step.\n\nThe following code snippet will perform the Independent Phenotypes Filtering:\n\n``` r\nget_independent_relevant_phenotypes_server(output_folder = \"../outputs\",\n                                           channel_file = \"../inputs/channel_data.csv\",\n                                           sample_file = \"../inputs/sample_data.csv\",\n                                           input_significant_phenotypes = \"significant_phenotypes.csv\",\n                                           output_file = \"independent_phenotypes.csv\",\n                                           log_file = \"independent_phenotypes.log\",\n                                           n_phenotypes = 1000,\n                                           min_confidence = 0.5,\n                                           verbose = TRUE,\n                                           n_threads = 8\n)\n```\n\nThe `output_file` and `log_file` parameters ar optional, but it's a convenience when trying different number of phenotypes on the same dataset, for example. They will be stored into `output_folder`, **DO NOT** put the full path to a file here, only the file name.\n\n\n\n"
