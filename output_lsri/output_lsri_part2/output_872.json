We provide a [setup notebook](notebooks/setup_puncta_analysis.ipynb) that guides the user through parameter adjustment for each step of the puncta detection pipeline, making the pipeline adaptable to various puncta types and image contrasts. \nTo quantify puncta properties per cell, we use [Cellpose](https://github.com/mouseland/cellpose) as the first step of the pipeline to [segment cells/nuclei](docs/roi_segmentation.md) from images of cell/nuclei-specific fluorescent marker. \n \n"
