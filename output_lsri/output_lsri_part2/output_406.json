        "value": "Pseudouridine (\u03a8) is one of the most abundant RNA modifications found in a variety RNA types, and it plays a significant role in many biological processes. The key to studying the various biochemical functions and mechanisms of \u03a8 is to identify the corresponding \u03a8 sites. However, identifying \u03a8 sites using experimental methods is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to develop computational methods which can accurately predict \u03a8 sites based on RNA sequence information. In this study, we proposed a new model called PseU-ST to identify \u03a8 sites in Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), and Mus musculus (M. musculus). We selected the best six coding schemes and four machine learning algorithms based on a comprehensive test of almost all RNA sequence coding schemes in the iLearnPlus software package, and selected the optimal features for each encoding scheme using chi-square and incremental feature selection (IFS) algorithms. Then, we selected the optimal feature combination and the best base-classifier combination for each species through an extensive performance comparison and employed a stacking strategy to build the predictive model. Empirical performance benchmarking tests demonstrated that PseU-ST achieved better prediction performance compared to other existing models. PseU-ST\u2019s accuracy scores were 93.64%, 87.74%, and 89.64% on H_990, S_628, and M_944, respectively, representing increments of 13.94%, 6.05%, and 0.26% versus the best existing methods on the same benchmark training datasets. The data indicate that PseU-ST is a very competitive prediction model for identifying RNA \u03a8 sites in H. sapiens, M. musculus, and S. cerevisiae. The code and data used in PseU-ST are available at (https://github.com/jluzhangxinrubio/PseU-ST/). In addition, we found that the Position-specific trinucleotide propensity based on single strand (PSTNPss) and Position-specific of three nucleotides (PS3) features play an important role in \u03a8 site identification.\n"
