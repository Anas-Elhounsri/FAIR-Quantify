        "value": "Input files: 1 - RNA secondary structure in either dot bracket notation (FASTA file) or CT (connectivity table) format; 2 - positional Shannon entropy for each nucleotide in the RNA, calculated from base pairing probabilities.\n\nRSCanner scans the secondary structure provided along with Shannon entropy values in sliding windows covering the entire RNA and calculates the base pair content (BPC) and median entropy values for each window. Then, it computes nucleotide positions with BPC values above a user-defined cutoff (default = 50th percentile) and Shannon entropy values below a user-defined cutoff (default = 50th percentile). These positions are termed structure counts. RSCanner then outputs the frequency distribution of structure counts across the RNA as both heatmap and histogram plots.  \n\nRSCanner uses a centered sliding window (default=51nt, 25nt flanks to each side of the center nucleotide, moved in steps of 1 nt across the RNA) to calculate BPC and median Shannon Entropy. If an even number window size is inputted, RSCanner will use the next odd number as the window size (i.e., if input=50, the actual window size=51). In this way, a centered sliding window is always used in all calculations. When dealing with the ends, RSCanner will gradually truncate the window size (i.e., for 5' end windows - window #26=[1nt,51nt], window#25=[1nt,50nt], window#24 =[1nt,49nt], etc; 3\u2019 end windows are computed analogously).\n"
