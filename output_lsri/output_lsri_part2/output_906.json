Download datasets.\n* JHU Dataset - Download [JHU COVID time-series data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) (download `time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv` for daily US infected cases and `time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv` for daily US death cases) and save in `data/COVID_JHU` directory. This project used `Mar 15,2020 - Nov 30,2021` for analysis. \n* NYT Dataset - Download [NYT COVID time-series data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) (download `us-states.csv` for daily US infected and death cases) and save in `data/COVID_NYT` directory. This project used `Mar 18,2020 - Nov 30,2021` for analysis. \n\n2. Generate Feature Matrix (X) and Adjacency Matrix (W) from downloaded datasets.\n* JHU Dataset (US) - Inside the folder `data/COVID_JHU`, run the file `Generate_51_states_X_W.py` to generate X and W matrix for 50 states of US and Washington D.C. (51 nodes of graph).\n* JHU Dataset (Michigan) - Inside the folder `data/COVID_JHU`, run the file `Generate_51_states_X_W_Michigan.py` to generate X and W matrix for 83 counties of the state of Michigan (83 nodes of graph).\n* NYT Dataset (US) - Inside the folder `data/COVID_NYT`, run the file `Generate_51_states_X_W_NYT.py` to generate X matrix for 50 states of US and Washington D.C. (51 nodes of graph). We used the same adjacency matrix (W) as generated using JHU dataset.\n\n3. Generate Train, Validation and Test datasets from the generated X matrix.\n* We divided the entire dataset in chronological order with 80% training, 10% validation and 10% testing.\n* Run the file `generate_training_data.py` to generate the processed files `train.npz, val.npz, test.npz` from X matrix and save the processed files in `data/COVID_JHU/processed` or `data/COVID_NYT/processed`. Use the `confirmed` or `deaths` in the argument to generate infected and death cases processed files respectively.\n```\n# For JHU Daily Infected cases data\npython generate_training_data.py --traffic_df_filename \"data/COVID_JHU/covid19_confirmed_US_51_states_X_matrix_final.csv\" \n\n# For NYT Daily Death cases data\npython generate_training_data.py --traffic_df_filename \"data/COVID_NYT/covid19_NYT_deaths_US_51_states_X_matrix_final.csv\"\n```\n"
