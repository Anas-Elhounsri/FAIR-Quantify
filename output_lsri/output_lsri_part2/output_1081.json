I assume you have some programming knowledge so we will skip the basics.\n\nTo contribute, we follow the standard issue/pull request system that is favoured by GitHub.\nMake a fork of the repo and (optionally) open an issue that describes what you want to fix/edit/improve/change.\nThe issue will be the hub for discussion for the change.\nIf you implemented the change, open a pull request (if you don't know how to, follow [this guide from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github) for more information on the process of forking and making pull requests).\nWe will review and merge your request if we find it reasonable an well-written.\n\n## Contributing BioTEA\nThe code is a standard PyPA package.\nInstall the required dev packages with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.\nWe use `bumpversion` and Black to manage the package version and the code style, respectively.\nI personally have pre-commit hooks setup to run the code through Black, but you may do it manually before you submit the code.\nIf you want to use pre-commit too, use `pre-commit install` before you commit.\n\nPlease write docstring to functions, following the [Google standard for Python docstrings](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).\n\n### Testing\nTest if the package works with `pytest` before submitting a pull request.\nTests live in the `tests/` folder.\nTo run tests, you will need to rebuild the docker locally with the \"bleeding\" version tag.\nCheckout the Box's repository ([https://github.com/CMA-Lab/bioTEA-box]), run `docker build -t cmalabscience/biotea-box:bleeding ./<path_to_the_box_repo>` to rebuild the docker with your local code.\nThen launch `pytest ./bioTea` to run tests.\n\nI'd be really grateful if you write more tests for the package. Please remember to always test the bleeding containers, not the latest ones.\n\nThe structure of the Python package is straightforward (I hope).\nI'd suggest reading the `cli.py` file first, and following the imports around if you want to familiarize yourself with the code.\nThe exported command that is invoked by `biotea` is `cli_root()` (at the time of writing).\nRefer to the `setup.cfg` file for more info.\n\nIn short, the Cli registers commands.\nThe core of the package is the docker wrapper, which interacts with the docker engine with an external package that gives an easy-to-use API for the daemon.\nI triple-check the parameters with so-called `BioTeaBoxInterface`s, classes that can be used to type-check inputs before being passed to the box.\nThe box also checks the inputs, but its checks are more fragile.\n\nFor questions or concerns, contact @mrhedmad.\n\n## Contributing to the box\n\"The box\" refers to the Biotea docker container.\nIts code lives in its own repository: [https://github.com/CMA-Lab/bioTEA-box].\nPlease look at that repository for more information.\n"

        "value": "> **IMPORTANT**: BioTEA works on UNIX systems. To run on Windows, use the [Windows Subsystems for Linux service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n\n1. Install **Docker**. The exact process is specific to your package manager:\n   - For Ubuntu, [follow this guide from the official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).\n   - For MacOS, [follow this guide from the official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/).\n   - For Arch Linux, install with:\n     ```zsh\n     pacman -Syu docker\n     systemctl enable --now docker.service\n     ```\n     You may need administrator privileges.\n   - For other distros, check your distro package manager documentation.\n2. Install **Python** version 3.9 or over. Again, this is dependent on your package manager:\n   - On Ubuntu, run `apt update && apt install python3.9`. Depending on when you read this guide, you may need to tap into [the deadsnakes PPA](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa). Read the guides on the link I provided for more information. Just be sure that the result of `python --version` is `3.9` or higher when you continue to the following steps.\n   - On Arch linux, run `pacman -Syu python`.\n   - On MacOS, [follow this guide in the python docs](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/).\n3. **Optional** but strongly recommended: Make a Python virtual environment to use bioTEA in. You can search online for a way to do this in your OS.\n4. Install bioTEA with `pip`: `pip install biotea`.\n\n> **IMPORTANT**: Sometimes, critical bugs are fixed on the main branch but are yet to be released to PyPi.\n  To get the development version of BioTEA, install it with `pip install 'biotea @ git+https://github.com/CMA-Lab/bioTEA.git#subdirectory=src/bioTea'`.\n  If you run into problems, try and use this bleeding edge version, your issue might be fixed already!\n\nIf installed correctly, `biotea info` should give some information on the tool.\n"

For more information on the various commands, read [the wiki](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/bioTEA/wiki).\n\nIf you run into problems using the BioTEA CLI, read [the FAQ page on the wiki](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/bioTEA/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions). If you still cannot solve the issue, [file a bug report](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/bioTEA/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+), detailing as much as you can your problem, including the versions of bioTEA, Python interpreter, Docker engine and your OS.\n\nIf you think that the issue is coming from the docker container (i.e. the Docker container is correctly launched but the analysis fails), you can [create an issue in the bioTEA-box repository](https://github.com/CMA-Lab/bioTEA-box/issues/new).\n"
