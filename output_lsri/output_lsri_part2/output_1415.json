        "description": "- the CDK depictions are generated using more fonts for labels\r\n- alkyl chain abbreviations are more diverse (eg. an ethyl group is now also abbreviated as \"C2H5\" instead of just as \"Et\")\r\n- \"Y\" has been added as an R group variable per default for generating Markush SMILES using the RandomMarkushStructureCreator. We are aware of the conflict with the element Yttrium, but it appears that the R group variable is a typical case, while the occurrence of Yttrium is very rare A user who does not want to use it can still exclude it.\r\n- The RandomMarkushStructureCreator now also includes the lowercase characters a-f in R group labels. For example, labels like \"R1a\" can be generated.\r\n- The RandomMarkushStructureCreator does not replace isotopes or charges atoms with R group labels anymore as the resulting SMILES are invalid (see #35). \r\n- The JVM heap size has been set to 4GB. We hope that this helps with #25, but this needs to be validated. For now, it does not break anything.",
