This involves de-noising by profile segmentation with a Poisson model (using [pasio](https://github.com/autosome-ru/pasio/)), and aggregation of Ribo-Seq coverage within segments, thus achieving reliable estimates of the regression slope. \n"

In a file [protocol-paper.sh](https://github.com/autosome-ru/papolarity/blob/master/protocol-paper.sh) you can find a script we used in a paper to process our datasets. It's slightly modified for better readability compared to a paper, and is more easily customizable. Also it has a few additional commands to generate plots which are absent in paper. Steps are named after paper sections. \nYou can use this protocol as is or change any parts you wish. As long as you comply with data formats and use consistent data (e.g. all files should be clipped in the same manner, or non-clipped at all), papolarity will work, order of commands, folder names, filenames and so on doesn't matter. \nTo run this pipeline, you should have several auxiliary tools installed: [csvtk](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/csvtk/), [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/), and python package [pasio](https://github.com/autosome-ru/pasio/).\n \n"

Please, double-check type of your alignment in case of problems.\n* Version 1.1.0 had a bug which caused incorrect results for transcripts\n* In the originally published protocol we recommended mapping the reads with STAR and then keeping only uniquely mapped reads by MAPQ filtering with samtools. This approach might be too stringent and even problematic as many reads initially mapped uniquely to the genome become multi-mappers in the alignment to the transcriptome (as there are often several overlapping transcripts per gene present in the transcript annotation). The updated version of the protocol solves this issue by requiring unique read mapping at the initial alignment step (see [protocol-paper-obtain-data.sh](protocol-paper-obtain-data.sh) script) w/o additional post-filtering. Other read mapping strategies (including keeping some multi-maps) might be also applicable in particular scenarios.\n \n"
