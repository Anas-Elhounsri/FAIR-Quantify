If you do not have a suitable NVIDIA GPU with at least 8GB of GPU memory then my current recommendation is to run via Google colab. A publicly available notebook is available at [Google Drive with Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/104narYAvTBt-X4QEDrBSOZm_DRaAKHtA?usp=sharing).\n\nOther options to run the server component of RootPainter on a remote machine include the [the sshfs server setup tutorial](https://github.com/Abe404/root_painter/blob/master/docs/server_setup_sshfs.md). You can also use Dropbox instead of sshfs.\n\n\nFor the next steps I assume you have a suitable GPU and CUDA installed.\n\n1. To install the RootPainter trainer:\n\n```\npip install root-painter-trainer\n```\n\n2. To run the trainer.  This will first create the sync directory.\n\n```\nstart-trainer\n```\n\nYou will be prompted to input a location for the sync directory. This is the folder where files are shared between the client and server. I will use ~/root_painter_sync.\nRootPainter will then create some folders inside ~/root_painter_sync.\nThe server should print the automatically selected batch size, which should be greater than 0. It will then start watching for instructions from the client.\n\nYou should now be able to see the folders created by RootPainter (datasets, instructions and projects) inside ~/Desktop/root_painter_sync on your local machine \nSee [lung tutorial](docs/cxr_lung_tutorial.md) for an example of how to use RootPainter to train a model. I now actually suggest following the [colab tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/104narYAvTBt-X4QEDrBSOZm_DRaAKHtA?usp=sharing) instructions but using your local setup instead of the colab server, as these are easier to follow than the lung tutorial.\n\n\n ### Questions and Problems\n \nThe [FAQ](https://github.com/Abe404/root_painter/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md) may  be worth checking before reaching out with any questions you have. If you do have a question you can either email me or post in the [discussions](https://github.com/Abe404/root_painter/discussions). If you have an issue/ have identified a problem with the software then you can [post an issue](https://github.com/Abe404/root_painter/issues).\n"

This improves semi-automatic segmentation workflows and enables easier comparison of the properties of the corrected segmentations to the predicted segmentations which is useful for model validation.\r\n*  Now possible to directly output segmentations in a format compatible with RhizoVision Explorer\r\n* More robust handling of dataset renaming and moving (you can now move and rename datasets already used in projects without RootPainter crashing when it is reopened).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Server install:\r\nThe RhizoVision segmentation option included in this client also requires that you also update the server to the latest version.
