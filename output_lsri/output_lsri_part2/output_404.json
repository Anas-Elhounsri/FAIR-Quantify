        "value": "PneumoKITy (**Pneumo**coccal **K**mer **I**ntegrated **Ty**ping) is a \nlite serotyping tool, developed for speed and sensitivity for mixed serotype calling and using experience of development and use of PneumoCaT to inform it's development. It is written for **Python 3.7+**. PneumoKITy uses the excellent tool [MASH](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x) for \nkmer based analysis. We decided to create a lite version (PneumoKITy) as this his tool has significant value \nfor both sensitive detection of mixed serotypes in fastQ data and is also significantly faster for serotype screening than existing methods which may mean\nit has utility  either as a quick assessment method which has input type flexibility for running PURE cultures, and when using fastq data it can be run on\nexpected mixed serotype samples (eg. Carriage study culture -enriched samples or even deep sequenced primary swabs) in order to attempt to assess serotype composition in \nthese more complex situations.\n\n\nPneumoKITy, like the original PneumoCaT tool assigns capsular types to\n*S.pneumoniae* genomic data  using a using a two step approach, But PneumoKITy, is limited only to second stage determinations that can be assessed using presence or absence or gene allele variants.\nHowever due to the extra specificity of the MASH method, PneumoKITy fully  serotype about 58% of the serotypes defined \nby the SSI Diagnostica typing sera, and can get to serogroup, or subgroup level for the remaining types. In addition \nPneumoKITy and provides some useful information regarding  some described genetic subtypes and genetic types. \nSerotypes that require determination using alternative variants such as SNPs cannot be distinquished using PneumoKITy.\nPneumoKITy has the advantage that it can be used on assembly files OR illumina fastq read files and it is incredibly fast.\n\nPneumoKITy has a useful RAG (red - amber- green) status flag which alerts users to the status of the results, with green \nflagged samples passing within expected metrics, amber flagged metrics indicating that a result was obtained but that the results\nshould be checked as some outcomes were not within range, or RED indicating a failure to serotype. \n\n\n**PneumoKITy has two run options:**\n\n`pure`  suitable for analysis of expected pure cultures. For this run method both fastq and assembly inputs can be used for analysis. This method which will increase specificity and \nreduce over reporting of mixed serotypes which may be present due to high levels of DNA from pure culture isolates. Although\nit will report genogroups of any mixed samples, PneumoKITy will assign these as an AMBER RAG status due to them being unexpected in a \npure culture. \n\n\n`mix` PneumoKITy is particularly sensitive to mixed serotypes when run with fastq data - which is useful for determination of types in multiple carriage.\nWhen run in mix mode PneumoKITy reports stage 2 variants where possible within mixtures of multiple \nserotype carriage and reports the results slightly differently.  Mixtures are not automatically assigned an AMBER rag status. MIX analysismethod can ONLY be used with fastq inputs. \n\n\n   \nPneumoKITy uses very different methods to previous PneumoCaT versions and requires a new running environment.\n\n The **C**apsular **T**ype **V**ariant database (CTVdb) used in PneumoKITy is now a real database, running in SQLite3,\n allowing  for much easier updating of information and better scope for the database to grow in the future as more variants and serotype \n determinants are added. The use of this format will also allow us to store  extra related information about the serotypes, such as subtype information \n (subtyping etc is planned in a future update). \n\nFor PneumoKITy specifically any snp or gene_function variants have been removed from the CTVdb as it is not possible to perform\nthese determinations using kmer screening alone, so the database is very small. \n\n\nThe database is populated from the included Excel template in database_tools. \n\nAt present the database import script can only import new data and has not yet been programmed with any functions to update existing records (future update)\n"

        "value": "PneumoKITy  uses a kmer based approach to \nscreen the read files or input assembly file against the capsular operon \nreferences (references.fasta) or gene presence absence references is stored as a mash sketch file (references.msh). \nIn the first stage, the input sequences are screened against a file of the\n capsular operon references (references.msh). The resulting data is analysed for hit\n  percentage (kmers in sample / kmers in reference x 100) and then filtered according to\n  the cut off values specified. \n-p kmer percentage - Percentage of hit kmers against total reference kmers for a given\nserotype reference sequence, calculated by PneumoKITy. \n-n median multiplicity -the median number of multiples of a given kmer in the dataset,\ngiven in mash screen output. Low kmer multiplicity could be caused by \nsequencing errors or mixed samples - only applicable for input read files if\n assembly files are input this value is automatically set to 1.  By default for \n fastq input data  this value is set to 10 for expected PURE culture runs and 4 for expected MIXED culture runs. \n\nThis results in several stage 1 outcome categories and also come with a RAG \nstatus (see Quality and Error checking): \n- `type` - A serotype that can be determined in stage 1 only. Resulted as final result \nwhen run in normal mode \n- `subtype` - a serotype that determined in stage 1 only but also has subtypes which \ncan be determined to add further information (*future update*)\n- `variants`  - a serotype that cannot determined in stage 1 only - needs further \ndetermination against capsular type variant database.\nPneumoKITy will attempt to subtype where variants exist in the limited database.\n- `mix` - Mixed serotypes are present\n- `mix_variants`  - mixed serotype analysis selected, and mix serotypes found which include some that cannot determined in stage 1 only - needs further \ndetermination against capsular type variant database of subtypes determined by PneumoKITy. \n- PneumoKITy will attempt to subtype where variants exist in the limited database.\n- `acapsular` - the kmer percentages against all capsular operon references were 20% and \nsuggests that the sample does NOT have a capsular operon present and may be an acapsular \norganism. Check phenotype and species ID.\n- `No hits` - No hits were determined but the kmer percentage to the reference operons\n was higher than that that might suggest an acapsular organism. Could be due to serotype\nvariant or due to poor sequencing quality.  \nIf the `variants` category is returned in stage 1 and the serotype has presence absence or allele variants\n then PneumoKITy proceeds to stage 2. \n**Stage 2 - Capsular Type Variants** -  only two categories of variants are available in stage 2, these are\ngene presence/absence and allele variants. Both of these methods are implemented using MASH in\na similar procedure to described above. Only genogroups 15F_15A and 19A_19AF(variant) are able to fully\ndetermine in stage 2. However some genogroups contain types that can be separated using the kmer screening determinations\neg 12F from 12A_12B_44_46 and 38 from 25F_25A. So depending on the serotype with in a genogroup you\nmay get either a type specific or genogroup specific result. \nAdditional reference files have been added to the CTVdb for serotypes 24F and 33F and referecen sequence for 18F has been replaced \ndue to the extra specificity of the kmer screening method causing many test samples to give low top hits and AMBER calls, due to divergence between the old reference strains\nused for the original PneumoCaT reference.fasta and isolates now circulating (in the UK). Once more data has been collected, potentially \nit may be possible to call other serotypes from groups to serotype level due to the greater specificity of the kmer method and increased\nmatch with the new references (eg 24F from B), however additional testing is needed to validate this. \nAll other serotypes requiring variant analysis will return a genogroup as the methods for determining SNPS and gene function/non-function\nvariants are not available. A partial gene profile will be present for those where some of the determinations are allele or presence/absence based. \n"

This was implemented to help avoid \n those annoying situations when a sample would miss just below the cut off as sometimes happened with PneumoCaT1 while also warning the user that something may be wrong with the result. \nIf an AMBER result is obtained it could be due to either poor sequence quality, or a variant of the sequence which does not match very well with the reference sequences available in the CTVdb - please check the results.  \nAmber result status also occurs in stage 2 for unrecognised variant profiles, or if a mixed result is obtained in an \nexpected pure culture run.  \n   \nRED rag status alerts the user to failure of the serotyping.

However, the organism could have a specific underlying genetic type as in the case of 23B1 and 19A/F for example.  \nSome previously described important genetic subtypes **are** represented in the ctvdb and can be determined by looking at the stage 1 hits. Eg. in the case of the variant 19A/F isolates that have the [genetic background of a 19A but produce a 19F capsular polysaccharide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19439547/) , the predicted serotype result would be 19F, but the stage 1 result is recorded as 19AF and the result is determined from 19A in stage 2 via wzy analysis, whereas a standard 19F isolate would be determine in stage 1 analysis alone by hit to the 19F reference. For 23B1 the top hit in stage 1 will be the 23B1 reference. At present there is no specific \"genetic subtype\" result field implemented (this is planned in a future version), so the user needs to look at the stage 1 hits to determine these. \nNew genetic types are being discovered all the time and it is not possible for us to keep up with them, however we hope that the outputs obtained from PneumoKITy will help the user to determine if their isolate may be a novel genetic serotype for which a reference is not available in the ctvdb, and can then be further investigated. \nif the sample has failed to hit a serotype a description of the result is output in this field. \n**`top hits`** - this is a list of the top 5 hits in the stage 1 analysis, with their MASH hit kmer percentage score in order highest to lowest. For serogroups 6 and 19, subtype references from [Elberse et al](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025018_) are included in the stage 1 references (eg 19F-III, 19A-IV).  Subtypes are not yet interpreted in the program but the closest hit subtype can be determined by reference to the top hit. \n**`max percent`** - the kmer percentage of the maximum hit in the MASH screen stage 1 analysis. \n**`stage 1 result`** - the outcome of stage 1 analysis. \n**`mix_mm`** - the estimated % abundance of each serotype in a mixture (calculated from the median multiplicity values >cut off)  \n- Only applicable if input is fastq and mixed serotypes are found \n**`stage 2 varids`** - the variant ID (keys) in the ctvdb sql database of the variants used for determination in stage2. \n**`stage 2 hits`** - the variant genes and results of stage 2 analysis, eg for those variants determined using MASH screen (gene presence/absence and allele) the result will be a hit % of kmers from sample vs kmers in the gene.  \n**`stage 2 result`** - outcome of any stage 2 analysis, eg hit variant determined (eg detected, not detected) \n"

        "value": " \n**-o** (output directory): An output directory can be specified using `-o \noutput_dir`. PneumoKITy will place a subfolder `pneumo_capsular_typing` \nwithin any specified output directory.  If no output dir is specified \nPneumoKITy defaults to using the input directory for either read1 if using \nfastq input or the assembly in this case ensure the input directory is writable or an\nerror will occur.\n \n \n**-t** (threads) Number of threads to use for subprocesses (default = 1) eg: `-t 8`\n\n**-m** (mash): path to mash software (If necessary). By default PneumoKITy will use the \ncommand  `mash` which will only work if the mash software is recognised as included in \n `PATH` variable (eg if installed from conda and runnign in conda environment).\nOtherwise the path to the mash software file location\n  **must** be provided eg: `-m path_to_mash/mash`.\n\n**-p** (minpercent): Alternative filter cut-off value for kmer percentage, ie \npercentage of kmer hits to reference. eg:  `-p 80` (default = 90) NB: The software will automatically \nincrementally drop the kmer percentage if no hits are initially obtained - and report serotype with an amber \nRAG status if determined with the dropped back cut off (auto drop min= 70%). \n\n**-n** (minmulti): minimum, median-multiplicity value cut off (relevant for fastq \nread input only). eg: `-n 10` (default = 4) Used to minimise the kmers present due to \nsequencing errors only.  We have set the default to 4 to allow sensitivity for mixed serotype detection, while\nretaining some specficity to ignore novel reads caused by sequencing errors. However if you are running expected pure\ncultures we recommend setting this value to 10 to avoid over sensitivity of detection of reads caused by contamination for eg.\nduring pure culture DNA extraction. Recommended minimum 4. \n\n**-s** (sampleid): Specify a sample ID for output files. If not specified \nPneumoKITy will default to the assembly file name or the fastq file name \n(split on character as specified in -S or on \".\" default). eg: `-s sample-name`\n\n**-S** (split): Specify a split character to split filename on for sample ID for output files. If not specified \nPneumoKITy will default to using \".\". Eg if using `-S _`, filename `sampleid_1.fastq.gz` becomes sampleID `sampleid`\n(split on first \"_\").\n\n**-c** (collate): Specify a folder for PneumoKITy to collate results from the run into a file called \"Collated_result_data.csv\" (folder *MUST* already exist).\nThis is useful when running multiple PneumoKITy jobs for a particular project, for example via a queue submission system or Bash loop command. The basic result data will be appended to this file until either the flag is not specified, a different folder is specified or the resulting file is moved or renamed. In rare instances multiple processing MAY result in this file not being writable, and a result beng missed from the collation. The original data files from the run will be saved in their output location.\n\n**-d** (database): path to capsular type variant database (ctvdb). By default this \nwill be the ctvdb that is contained within the PneumoKITy program. \n\n\nAn alternative ctvdb folder can be specified (ADVANCED USERS ONLY). If you wish to use an \n alternative ctvdb we recommend that this is stored in a separate folder location\n and called using the -d option. To avoid confusion when troubleshooting,\n  please do **NOT**  overwrite the included ctvdb and run without specifying the option -d.\n eg: `-d path_to_alternativectvdb\n"
