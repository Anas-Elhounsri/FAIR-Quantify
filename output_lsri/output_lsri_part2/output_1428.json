It works without prior information about the adapter sequence making it applilcable even when this information is unavailable. The program is written in R which allows for nice visual reports and uses [Seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) in the back-end for handling of fastq data, which is a fast, lightweight tool written in C. \nThis program is most suitable for long, variable-length reads, for example, from the Oxford Nanopore instruments. This is because read end trimming for long reads does not have a significant impact on the overall read throughput post-cleaning. This program has also been modified to accommodate short, fixed-length (Illumina) reads for identification of adapter contamination, however, end-trimming on such datasets is disabled by default.\n \n"

Still, the adapter sequences are so alike that in our tests we could see a difference in real 16S sequence representation and adapters. That said, the problem will be harder when the community would be dominated by fewer taxonomies with higher similarity in their V3-V4 region of the 16S generally sequenced for such studies. On the other side, most 16S analysis platforms like mothur or QIIME2 have their own protocols for removing read contamination which works well. Adapters also have less of an impact over marker gene sequencing because at some point in the analysis, users align it to a database of marker genes of interest. Analysis protocols can choose to not look at any segments of the read that did not align and completely circumvent any adapter issues. This is not feasible for metagenomic sequencing as it is randomized over entire lengths of genomes in a community.\n"

Once you have the `conda` set up and working, please start a new session.\n\n*Optional: Install and use `mamba` for conda management.*\n[Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) is a reimplementation of the Conda package manager in C++ and has several benefits over using Conda. It works as a drop-in replacement for `conda` for most Conda commands except for environment activation commands. Full help and instructions can be viewed on the [Mamba GitHub page](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba), but for simplicity here is how you can install `mamba` with your `conda` installation.\n\n`$ conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba`\n\nAfter this installation, `mamba` can be used in the next step (and for management of any other environments/packages). We recommend using `mamba` as the parallelization during installation helps speed up the process of getting several R libraries if your network and storage media allows.\n\nNow SNIKT can be set up in a new environment with the following command.\n\n`$ mamba create -n snikt snikt`\n\nor\n\n`$ conda create -n snikt snikt`\n\nAnd that's it for the setup with this option. Activate the environment and feel the power of Adamantium blades slicing and dicing nucleotides!\n```\n$ conda activate snikt\n$ snikt.R --version\nSNIKT 0.4.0\n```\nIf you ever need to uninstall, you can remove the environment with the following.\n\n`$ conda remove -n snikt --all`\n"

A slightly older version of Seqtk is also available in the `apt` package manager for Ubuntu Linux.\n\nNext, you can install the packages in your R (we recommend R >= 4.0) library. To do this, you can do the following in your R terminal.\n```\n$ R\nR version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) -- \"Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out\"\n...\n\n> install.packages( c(\"tidyverse\",\"gridExtra\",\"docopt\",\"lubridate\"), dependencies = TRUE)\n```\n\nNow, that the dependencies are set, we can download SNIKT.\n\n`$ git clone https://github.com/piyuranjan/SNIKT.git`\n\nAfter this download, you can either put the downloaded folder on your system `PATH` or copy the `snikt.R` code to a location that is already on your `PATH`.\n\n\n"

After that, it prepares a summary report with the following elements.  \n\n![Pre-QC Summary](images/preqc_summary.png)\n\nThis part of the summary report is similar to the temporary graph presented to the user for making a decision on trim lengths. It shows a bias in nucleotide compositions and Phred scores suggesting contamination at ends.  \n\n![Post-QC Summary](images/postqc_summary.png)\n\nThis part of the summary report shows the effect of trimming and filtering on the reads.

For example, the following command will run the first phase on all fastq files in a directory using `<n>` threads.\n\n`$ parallel -vkj<n> snikt.R -n {} ::: *.fastq.gz`\n\nThis step will disable any cleanup process and will prepare a pre-QC report with a 6 panel graph.

Use this report to make a decision about trim and filter lengths.  \n\n![No-QC Summary](images/noqc_summary.png)\n\nThis report can also be tailored for Illumina reads with the `--illumina` preset option.  \n\nOnce a decision is made, user can execute SNIKT again this time with pre-set trim and filter options.\n\n`$ snikt.R --trim5=120 --trim3=25 --filter=1000 reads.fastq.gz`\n\nOr if the trim criteria are same across all fastq, the command can be parallelized on `<n>` threads.\n\n`$ parallel -vkj<n> snikt.R -T 120 -t 25 -f 1000 {} ::: *.fastq.gz`\n\nThis step will now clean up reads and will prepare a report pre- and post-cleanup similar to the one generated with the interactive mode.
