Both of the above.\n\nHaploCoV incorporates a standalone \"scoring system\" (*VOC-ness score* from here onward) for the identification and flagging of VOC and VOI-like variants based on the functional annotation of the genome. Interesting/relevant candidate variants are identified as those showing a significant increase (above a minimum threshold) in their score compared with their parental lineage/variant. The suggested minimum treshold is 2.5 or 10% of the total score of the parental lineage (whichever is higher, see the paper for more details). \n\nIncrease/decrease in prevalence is inferred by analyses of the (available) metadata. By default novel candidate variants with a prevalence above 1% in a region/country, and showing an increase by at least 2 fold over 4 weeks are reported. \nThese parameters can be configured by the user at runtime.\n\nThe main output consists of a report file that summarizes the prevalence and features (as defined by the criteria outlined above) of novel candidate variants of SARS-CoV-2.  \n\n<hr>\n"

The novel designation has 34 additional defining genomic variants compared with its parental. The VOC-ness score is increased from 4.42 to 18.58. \nAlthough the novel designation has a prevalence of almost 80% by 2021-04-28, a 2 fold increase in prevalence is not detected at any time point. \n<br>\nThe intermediate file *India_assigned.txt.prev* in the *India_custom_results* folder provides a more detailed picture of the spread of the novel designation (again, see screenshot).\nAccording to this \"extended\" prevalence report, B.1.1.N1 is first observed at 2021-03-30, and shows a prevalence of ~ 45% by then (see screenshot). Although the prevalence of the variant grows rapidly, the increase is lower that 2 fold at the intervals of time included in the analysis.\n\n![image](https://github.com/matteo14c/HaploCoV/blob/b5558f609b95328b0af471d80e548e3bb0ae0f91/images/FigDelta.jpeg).\n\nThis is probably due to the patchy pattern of available data. Indeed we observe that no prevalence is reported for several interval of time in *India_assigned.txt.prev*; this indicates that for several intervals less than 10 genomic sequences were available, 10 being the minimum number of sequences required by HaploCoV to do this computation (see [prevalence report](https://haplocov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/increase.html) in the manual for a more comprehensive explanation). \n"

According to the specfications provided by *omicron.loc* only isolates from South Africa, and in between 2021-07-01 and 2021-12-31 will be analysed.\nMain results are saved to *SouthAfrica_custom.rep*. Intermediate files to *SouthAfrica_custom_results*.\nSimilar to use case 2, only one novel \"insteresting\" designation is identified by HaploCoV: B.1.1.N1. This novel designation is characterized by 58 genomic variants that are not shared with the parental. The VOC-ness score is increased from 3.50 to 21.82. \nAccording to the prevalence report, B.1.1.N1 has a prevalece above 95% (0.95) in South Africa by 2021-12-26. However B.1.1.N1 is not flagged as an \"increased prevalence\" variant, since it does not show an increase in prevalence of 2 fold or higher at any interval of time (see screenshot below).\n\n![image](https://github.com/matteo14c/HaploCoV/blob/b5558f609b95328b0af471d80e548e3bb0ae0f91/images/FigOmic.jpeg).\n\nThe intermediate file *SouthAfrica_assigned.txt.prev* in the *SouthAfrica_custom_results* folder can be used to obtain more information about the prevalence of the newly defined designation.\nFrom the report it is possible to observe that B.1.1.N1 is first identified by HaploCoV at 2021-11-22, and shows a prevalence greater than 86%. Similar to use case 2, also in this case the data are patchy and several intervals of tim have missing data. In this scenario the novel variant is not identified as a variant \"showing and increase in prevalence\" since it is already dominant/widespread by the time it is first identified.\n\n<hr>\n"
