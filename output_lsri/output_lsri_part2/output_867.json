        "value": "BIONIC (**Bio**logical **N**etwork **I**ntegration using **C**onvolutions) is a deep-learning based biological network integration algorithm that incorporates graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn integrated features for genes or proteins across input networks. BIONIC produces high-quality gene features and is scalable both in the number of networks and network size.\r\n\r\nAn overview of BIONIC can be seen below.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC/development/architecture_diagram.png\" alt=\"BIONIC architecture diagram\" border=\"0\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n1. Multiple networks are input into BIONIC\r\n2. Each network is passed through its own graph convolutional encoder where network-specific gene (node) features are learned based the network topologies. These features can be passed through the encoder multiple times to produce gene features which incorporate higher-order neighborhoods. These features are summed to produce integrated gene features which capture topological information across input networks. The integrated features can then be used for downstream tasks, such as gene co-annotation prediction, module detection (via clustering) and gene function prediction (via classification).\r\n3. In order to train and optimize the integrated gene features, BIONIC first decodes the integrated features into a reconstruction of the input networks (**a**) and, if labelled data is available for some of the genes (such as protein complex membership, Gene Ontology annotations, etc.), BIONIC can also attempt to predict these functional labels (**b**). Note that any amount of labelled data can be used, from none (fully unsupervised), to labels for every gene, and everything in between.\r\n4. BIONIC then minimizes the difference between the network reconstruction and the input networks (i.e. reconstruction error) by updating its weights to learn gene features that capture relevant topological information (**a**) and, if labelled data is provided, BIONIC updates its weights to minimizes the difference between the label predictions and true labels (**b**). \r\n\r"

Before installing BIONIC, it is recommended you create a virutal Python **3.8** environment using tools like the built in `venv` command, or [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/).\r\n\r\n2. Make sure your virtual environment is active, then install BIONIC by running\r\n\r\n       $ pip install https://github.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC/releases/download/v${VERSION}/bionic_model-${VERSION}+${CUDA}-cp38-cp38-${OS}.whl\r\n\r\n    where `${VERSION}`, `${CUDA}` and `${OS}` correspond to the BIONIC version, valid CUDA version (as specified above), and operating system, respectively. `${OS}` takes a value of `linux_x86_64` for Linux, and `win_amd64` for Windows. \r\n    \r\n    For example, if we wanted to install the latest version of BIONIC to run on the CPU on a Linux system, we would run\r\n    \r\n       $ pip install https://github.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC/releases/download/v0.2.6/bionic_model-0.2.6+cpu-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl\r\n\r\n    **NOTE:** There is a [known bug](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7626) in certain versions of `pip` which may result in a `No matching distribution` error. If this occurs, install `pip==19.3.1` and try again.\r\n\r\n3. Test BIONIC is installed properly by running\r\n\r\n       $ bionic --help\r\n       \r\n    You should see a help message. \r\n\r"

You can have a uniquely named config file for each integration experiment you want to run. An example config file can be found [here](https://github.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC/blob/master/bionic/config/yeast_gi_coex_ppi.json).\r\n\r\nThe configuration keys are as follows:\r\n\r\nArgument | Default | Description\r\n--- | :---: | ---\r\n`net_names` | `null` | List of filepaths of input networks. If a string is used instead with a `\"*\"` after the path, BIONIC will integrate all networks in the corresponding directory.\r\n`label_names` | `null` | Filepaths of node label JSON files. An example node label file can be found [here](https://github.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC/blob/master/bionic/inputs/yeast_IntAct_complex_labels.json).\r\n`out_name` | config file path | Path to prepend to all output files. If not specified it will be the path of the config file. `out_name` takes the format `path/to/output` where `output` is an extensionless output file name.\r\n`delimiter` | `\" \"` | Delimiter for input network files.\r\n`epochs` | `3000` | Number of training steps to run BIONIC for (see [**usage tips**](#usage-tips)).\r\n`batch_size` | `2048` | Number of genes in each mini-batch. Higher numbers result in faster training but also higher memory usage.\r\n`sample_size` | `0` | Number of networks to batch over (`0` indicates **all** networks will be in each mini-batch). Higher numbers (or `0`) result in faster training but higher memory usage.\r\n`learning_rate` | `0.0005` | Learning rate of BIONIC. Higher learning rates result in faster convergence but run the risk of unstable training (see [**usage tips**](#usage-tips)).\r\n`embedding_size` | `512` | Dimensionality of the learned integrated gene features (see [**usage tips**](#usage-tips)).\r\n`shared_encoder` | `false` | Whether to use the same graph attention layer (GAT) encoder for all the input networks. This may lead to better performance in certain circumstances.\r\n`initialization` | `\"kaiming\"` | Weight initialization scheme. Valid options are `\"xavier\"` or `\"kaiming\"`.\r\n`lambda` | `null` | Relative weighting between reconstruction and classification loss: `final_loss = lambda * rec_loss + (1 - lambda) * cls_loss`. Only relevant if `label_names` is specified. If `lambda` is not provided but `label_names` is, `lambda` will default to `0.95`.\r\n`neighbor_sample_size` | `2` | Size of neighborhoods to sample around each node for progressive GAT passes per training step (see [**usage tips**](#usage-tips)).\r\n`gat_shapes.dimension` | `64` | Dimensionality of each individual GAT head (see [**usage tips**](#usage-tips)).\r\n`gat_shapes.n_heads` | `10` | Number of attention heads for each network-specific GAT.\r\n`gat_shapes.n_layers` | `2` | Number of times each network is passed through its corresponding GAT. This number corresponds to the effective neighbourhood size of the convolution.\r\n`model_parallel` | `false` | Whether to distribute the model over multiple GPUs (i.e. model parallelism, not data parallelism). This is useful if you have many large networks and a highly parameterized model that will not fit on a single GPU.\r\n`save_network_scales` | `false` | Whether to save the internal learned network features scaling coefficients.\r\n`save_label_predictions` | `false` | Whether to save the predicted node labels (if applicable).\r\n`save_model` | `true` | Whether to save the trained model parameters and state.\r\n`pretrained_model_path` | `null` | Path to a pretrained model (.pt file) to load parameters from.\r\n`tensorboard.training` | `false` | Whether to output training progress to TensorBoard.\r\n`tensorboard.embedding` | `false` | Whether to embed learned feature with TensorBoard projector.\r\n`tensorboard.log_dir` | `null` | Output directory of TensorBoard logging files. Default is `\"runs\"`. See [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html#torch.utils.tensorboard.writer.SummaryWriter) for more information.\r\n`tensorboard.comment` | `\"\"` | Comment to add to TensorBoard output file name. See [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensorboard.html#torch.utils.tensorboard.writer.SummaryWriter) for more information.\r\n`plot_loss` | `true` | Whether to plot the model loss curves after training.\r\n`save_loss_data` | `false` | Whether to save the training loss data in a .tsv file.\r\n\r\nThe `.` notation indicates a nested field, so `gat_shapes.dimension` (for example) becomes\r\n\r\n```\r\ngat_shapes: {\r\n    dimension: ${DIM_VALUE}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the config file.

We found the default `512` works for most networks, though it's worth experimenting with different sizes for your application. In general, higher `embedding_size` will encode more information present in the input networks but at the risk of also encoding noise.\r\n- `gat_shapes.dimension` should be increased for networks with many nodes.
