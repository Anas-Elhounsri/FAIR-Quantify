Support for HPC, docker, singularity, AWS and many other\nsystems are provided via nextflow. \nWhile it is possible to resolve the dependencies using conda for running on macOS, its recommended that this option be\nused on linux systems for which it has been extensively test.\nIf running on macOS it recommended that docker be used with the provided image, in which case it is similar to running\nin a linux environment. \n* Nextflow: [Nextflow install](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted)\n    * Installing nextflow via conda is recommended, since with conda other dependencies can also be resolved.\n* Conda or containerization platform\n    * If using conda, the conda package manager available\n      from: [Miniconda download](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n    * If using containers, docker is recommended and is available\n      from: [Docker download](https://www.docker.com/get-started).\n        * The required docker image can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/sidkris/rhometa.\n        * It is not required that the user download the image, the program has been pre-configured to use this image,\n          provided docker is\n          installed and the docker option is enabled.\n    * Other container technologies such as singularity (used for HPCs) are also supported via nextflow. \nInstructions for installing nextflow and using the provided docker image for dependencies \nThe rhometa program is made up of 3 separate pipelines. Each of which can be used independently as necessary.\n![Modules](images/modules.png) \n* **theta_est.nf** is used to determine the population mutation rate (theta) per site based on the Watterson estimate as\n  implemented in LDhat, details in methods. This pipeline estimates of theta on the dataset of interest, furthermore\n  theta per site is one of the required parameters for generating lookup tables. The user has the option to use the\n  estimated theta or a different value when generating lookup tables. \n* **lookup_table_gen** this pipeline makes use of LDpop and pyrho to generate the lookup tables required for the\n  recombination rate estimator and can be launched in one of 2 ways. It can either use a pre-generated lookup table for\n  high depth, which then will be downsampled for each depth from 3 to the depth of the lookup table or the pipeline can\n  generate a high depth lookup table from scratch and then perform the downsampling step. The downsampling algorithm is\n  a part of pyrho, it is significantly faster to generate the required smaller lookup tables from a larger table via\n  downsampling and the results are essentially identical. \n* **rho_est.nf** is used to estimate the population recombination rate of metagenomic read based datasets provided in\n  the form of bam and reference fasta files. It makes use of the lookup tables generated by the lookup_table_gen\n  pipeline. The pipeline has a subsampling feature builtin which is able to downsample the bam to the maximum specified\n  depth, that is the depth of the largest lookup table, ensuring that positions with a high depth of coverage are not\n  omitted from consideration. The bam subsampling is seeded to enable random sampling of reads and the same seed value\n  is also used for the final bootstrapping step. A list of seed values can be used for testing and identifying any\n  variance that can stem from the subsampling and bootstrapping process. In general if the depth of the largest lookup\n  table is small, more downsampling is needed and this could mean some loss in accuracy of estimation. If the depth of\n  the bam is within the maximum depth of the lookup tables, the bam file will then be used as is. \n## Input preparation for rho_est and theta_est pipelines \nWe have endeavoured to make the process of preparing a metagenomic dataset for analysis with Rhometa straight forward\nwith very little preprocessing steps. Short reads can be aligned to existing reference genomes representing the\nmetagenomic dataset, to reference MAGs (Metagenome-Assembled Genome) or pangenomes representative of the microbial\ncommunity. Multi sequence references are also supported. The reference genomes provide a scaffold to align the reads,\nfrom which the rates of recombination and mutation are determined in the rho_est and theta_est pipelines. \n## Quick start and output \nThe following quick start example makes use of the files\nin [toy_dataset.zip](https://github.com/sid-krish/rhometa/blob/main/toy_dataset.zip). The section should be followed in\nsequence.\nThis example is designed to help ensure that rhometa and it's pipelines are configured properly and to demonstrate a\ntypical workflow.\nThe toy datasets were simulated using the simulation pipeline [rhometa_sim](https://github.com/sid-krish/rhometa_sim) \nThere are 2 examples one for paired_end and one for single_end reads.\nWhen using the rho_est.nf pipeline a toggle is used for the appropriate read type, this will be demonstrated.\nThe bam files contain the aligned reads and the fa file contains the reference genome. \nTypically, the first step is to get the theta per site estimate this is because this in addition to the statistic the\nvalue can be optionally used to\nfor generating the lookup tables required for rho_est.nf pipeline. Note the process for analysing the paired_end and\nsingle_end\nfiles are the same for theta_est.nf. \nThe distribution of read depth in the filtered bam file is visualised in the file ending with the name\ndepth_distribution.png. \nThe theta estimate at each read depth is visualised in the file ending with theta_estimates.png. \nThe main output file is the one that ends with Theta_estimate_stats. It provides the theta per site for mean and median\nread depth. The single end results for the toy dataset are as follows:\n```\n# tps_mean_depth = theta_per_site_at_mean_depth\n# tps_median_depth = theta_per_site_at_median_depth\nmean_depth,78.0\ntps_mean_depth,0.004892598825041059\nmedian_depth,78.0\ntps_median_depth,0.004892598825041059\n```\nand the paired end results are:\n```\n# tps_mean_depth = theta_per_site_at_mean_depth\n# tps_median_depth = theta_per_site_at_median_depth\nmean_depth,74.0\ntps_mean_depth,0.004916367682819357\nmedian_depth,75.0\ntps_median_depth,0.004902775805147897\n```\n \nThe toy_datasets were simulated with a theta value of 0.01, by default lookup_table_gen.nf will generate lookup tables\nfor this theta value. For the quick start example it is not required to change any values, if however, you wish to use\nthe estimated theta value from the previous step this can be done using the option --theta followed by the desired\nvalue. \nlookup_table_gen.nf, under with default settings, will first generate a lookup table for a read depth of 85 for rho\nvalues between 0-100 (inclusive) in increments of 1. This range can be adjust with the option --lookup_grid if desired,\nthis will be discussed later in the pipeline options and advanced usage section. Once the lookup table is generated for\na read depth of 85, the downsampling algorithm will be applied to generate lookup tables for depth 3 to 85, 3 is the\nlowest depth the pipeline can accurately process. \nThis command typically takes around 15-20 mins to run on a machine with 4 cores and 16 GB of ram. \nThe default output folder for this pipline is 'Lookup_tables' within which will be the original lookup table for a depth\nof 85 titled 'lookup_table.txt' and the downsampled tables which are formatted to be used by rho_est.nf \nHaving performed the necessary prerequisite steps we can now estimate rho using the rho_est.nf pipeline. With\nrho_est.nf, care should be taken when using single end and paired end reads, and the correct setting should be selected\notherwise the pipeline may crash or generate inaccurate results. \nBy default, rho_est.nf runs in paired end mode, to enable single end mode the toggle --single_end is used. \nThe default settings of the rho_est.nf pipeline has been configured to work with the quick start example as is. The\nrho_est.nf pipeline has a subsampling feature that will subsample the bam to work with the available lookup tables.\nAdditional pipeline options and advanced usage will be covered in the Pipeline Options and Advanced Usage section. \nThe file ending with rho_estimate.csv contains only the most likely rho value. This is the main output file. \nThe file ending with results_plot.png is a visual represenation of the information in *log_likelihood_sums.csv. \nIn this section, the options for each of the pipelines will covered and further information will be provided where\nnecessary. In general pipeline specific options are activated using \"--option_name\", options specific to nextflow are\nactivate with \"-option_name\". \nThis pipeline makes use of [ldpop](https://github.com/popgenmethods/ldpop), it has been tailored for use with rhometa. \n--lookup_grid, specifies the gird of rho values to generate lookup tables for, the default setting \"101,100\" will values\nfrom 0-100 )inclusive in steps of 1. Setting this value to \"201,100\" will cause the values to increase in steps of 0.5,\nmeaning it will be more fine scale. It is also possible to create a non-uniform grid for instance \"0,0.01,1,1,100\" will\ncreate a grid where the rho values go from 0-1 in steps of 0.01 and 1 to 100 in steps of 100, this is useful for having\nfine scale values between 0-1. \n--lk_table, with this option if a lookup table has already been generated, just the downsampling step can be performed\nusing it. For example if I have a table for depth of 100, I just need to change --lk_table_max_depth to 100 and use\n--lk_table. This will create tables for depths 3 to the max depth. \n### rho_est.nf\n```\nUsage:\nnextflow run rho_est.nf --bam in.bam --fa ref.fa [options]\n\nHelp:\nnextflow run rho_est.nf --help\n\nRequired:\n--bam [*.bam], Multi bam support via glob input e.g. \"*.bam\", quotes but be included for glob.
