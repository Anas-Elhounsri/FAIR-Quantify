This facilitates review and allows for a\nmore focused discussion.\n\n## Debugging\n\nWhen compiling strobealign, you can add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` to\nthe `cmake` options to get debug symbols.\n\nIf needed, run `make` with `VERBOSE=1` to get more logging output at build\ntime.\n\nTo get more logging output when running strobealign, add the `-v` option to\nthe command line.\n\nAdd `--details` to get more detailed SAM output with some\nstrobealign-specific tags added to each alignment record.\n(See below.)\n\nTo get even more verbose output, add `-DTRACE=ON` to your CMake options and\nre-compile strobealign. This outputs a list of the found NAMs for each read.\n\n## Testing\n\nAfter CMake has been run, you can use this one-liner to compile strobealign and\nrun the tests:\n```\nmake -s -j -C build && tests/run.sh\n```\n\nWhenever you make changes that could potentially affect mapping results, you can\nrun a more elaborate test that compares strobealign against a \u201cbaseline\u201d\n(know good) commit. Just run this script:\n```\ntests/compare-baseline.sh\n```\nThe first time, it will download a *D. melanogaster* genome and some reads from\nthe Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Since the dataset is truncated to the first\n100'000 reads, mapping it should take less than 30 seconds.\n\nThe baseline commit is configured in `tests/baseline-commit.txt`. The script\nbuilds strobealign from that commit and runs it against the downloaded test\ndata, then builds strobealign as it is in your working copy and compares the\ntwo produced BAM files. The baseline BAM is cached and re-used as long as the\nbaseline commit does not change.\n\n## Making a release\n\n* Update changelog (adjust section header)\n* Bump version in `CMakeLists.txt`\n* Bump version in `setup.py`\n* Commit\n* Push and wait for CI to pass\n* Do `git tag ...` and `git push --tags`\n* Make a release via the GitHub releases page\n* Wait for the Bioconda bot to pick up the new release and then approve its\n  version bump PR\n\n## Style guide\n\nExisting code in strobealign is currently not necessarily consistent with this\nstyle guide, but new code should follow it.\n\n* Use the `clang-format` code formatter with the `-style=file` option.\n* Use Python-like naming of functions, methods, variables, etc. That is, it\n  should be `ClassName`, `variable_name`, `method_name`, `CONSTANT`.\n* The header guard of a file named `xyz.hpp` should be named\n  `STROBEALIGN_XYZ_HPP`.\n\n## Detailed SAM output (`--details`)\n\nWhen `--details` is provided, the following additional SAM tags are output for\nmapped reads.\n\n`na`: Number of NAMs (seeds) found\n`nr`: The number of NAMs found during NAM rescue or -1 if no rescue was attempted\n`mr`: Number of times mate rescue was attempted (local alignment of a mate to\n  the expected region given its mate)\n`al`: Number of times an attempt was made to extend a seed (by gapped or ungapped alignment)\n`ga`: Number of times an attempt was made to extend a seed by gapped alignment\n`X0`: Number of equally scored best alignments (greater than 1 for multimappers).\n For paired-end reads, the tag is output for both reads, but the value is\n identical and is the number of equally scored best alignment *pairs*.\n"

Previously, decompressing gzipped-compressed input files was a bottleneck starting at about 30 threads.\r\n  We now use [ISA-L](https://github.com/intel/isa-l/) for decompression, which is about three times as fast as zlib, and decompression is also done in a separate thread. We tested up to 128 cores, and strobealign was still able to use all cores.\r\n  Contributed by @telmin.\r\n* #447: Switched to a new way for hashing randstrobes in preparation for the introduction of multi-context seeds.

        "description": "## Changes\r\n\r\nThis is a large release with over 600+ commits since the previous one (0.7.1). Much of the work that went into it was enabled by a\r\n[Bioinformatics Long-Term Support](https://nbis.se/support/) grant through [National Bioinformatics Structure Sweden (NBIS)](https://nbis.se/), which is the [SciLifeLab Bioinformatics platform](https://www.scilifelab.se/units/nbis/).\r\n\r\nA majority of the commits was focused on reorganizing the code to make it easier to maintain, to read, to test and to change. This has already paid off in the form of external contributions that would have been more difficult without those changes.\r\n\r\nAnother focus was on usability and standards compliance: SAM output follows the SAM specification more closely, error messages are better, there is now a `--help` command-line option, some irrelevant logging output was hidden, and the documentation was updated.\r\n\r\nMapping speed and accuracy remain mostly unaffected in this release, except for one bugfix that increases mapping rate and accuracy at short read lengths (<100 bp). Also, some unintended coverage spikes no longer occur.\r\n\r\nMemory usage was decreased due to switching to a modified in-memory representation of the index. For the human genome, for example, RAM usage went from 28 GiB to 21 GiB. The reduction is smaller for more repetitive genomes.\r\n\r\nStrobealign also gained the ability to pre-generate an index and save it to disk. As indexing is quite fast, this is not as relevant as it is for other read mappers, but important when processing many small libraries.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [full Changelog](https://github.com/ksahlin/strobealign/blob/v0.8.0/CHANGES.md).\r\n",

        "description": "Major update in the implemented parallelization. The new parallel implementation allows a much more efficient interplay with `reading input -> aligning -> writing output`. This results in much better CPU usage as the number of threads increases. For example, I observed an almost a 2x speedup (50-30% reduced runtime) across four larger datasets when using  16 cores (SIM and GIAB 150bp and 250bp reads, see README benchmarks). \r\n\r\nFor reference, previous naive parallelization ran in sequential order: 1. Read batch of reads with one thread 2. Align batch input in parallel with OpenMP 3. Write output with one thread. New parallelization performs 1-3 across threads with mutex on input and output. Such types of parallelization are commonly applied in other tools.\r\n\r\nThis release also includes:\r\n* Implemented automatic inference of read length, which removes the need of specifying `-r` (as reported in https://github.com/ksahlin/StrobeAlign/issues/19)\r\n* Some minor bugfixes. For example, [this bug](https://github.com/ksahlin/StrobeAlign/issues/17) is fixed.\r\n\r\nThis release has identical or near-identical alignments to the previous version v0.6.1 (same accuracy and SV calling stats across tested datasets)",

Crucial bugfix to v0.5 causing rare but occasional alignments to very long reference regions due to bug in coordinate. This becomes detrimental to speed.\r\n2. Identifying symmetrical hash collisions and in those cases test the reverse orientation. This leads to a further slight bump in alignment accuracy over previous versions, particularly for shorter read lengths.\r\n3. Fix to rare but occasional uninitialized joint alignment score `S` calculation that would cause suboptimal alignment \r\n4. Fixes reporting of template len field in SAM output if deletion in alignment.",

        "description": "Major update of strobealign. This version comes with an improvement in accuracy (and the number of aligned reads) around lengths 100-125nt reads, and it is also faster than older versions for these lengths. Most notable changes:\r\n\r\n- Algorithm changes\r\n  - Using xxhash instead of no hash for strobes. Gives a better pseudorandom generation of hashes for linking.\r\n  - Linking strobes using bitcount( (h_1 ^ h_2) ^ q) which creates a skewed seed length distribution towards shorter seeds in the window. This improves mapping candidate read detection particularly for shorter reads (100nt).\r\n\r\n- Parameters\r\n  - Adding the option to customize sampling window of second strobe with `-l` and `-u`.\r\n  - Adding a parameter `-r [INT]` for approximate read length (default 150). This will make strobealign customize parameters `-l` `-u`, and `-k`\r\n- Also cuts the reference accessions at first space, which fixes issue #4 \r\n",
