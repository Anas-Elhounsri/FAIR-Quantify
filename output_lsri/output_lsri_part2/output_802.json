Divide and Compare (DivCom) is an automated tool for advanced beta diversity analysis. DivCom reveals the inner structure of the groups by dividing their samples into the appropriate number of clusters and then compares the distances of every profile to the centers of these clusters. The advantage of this approach is that it takes into consideration the substructure of the dataset and uses beta diversity measures as distances metrics. This information can be used for determining the existing interrelation of the groups.\n"
