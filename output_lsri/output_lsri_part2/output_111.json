        "description": "# 4.1.0 (2024-09-16)\n\nVersion 4.1.0 of RNAlysis features improved performance and stability across the board, thanks to a switch to Qt6 and Numpy 2.\n\n## Changed\n\n- RNAlysis now runs on Qt6 instead of Qt5. This change should improve both performance and stability across RNAlysis.\n- When importing parameters for differential expression analysis, RNAlysis will now automatically load the design matrix and chosen comparisons. This should work even with parameters that were exported in previous versions of RNAlysis.\n- Made small improvements to the RNAlysis graphical interface.\n- RNAlysis and its dependencies now run on Numpy 2 instead of Numpy 1.\n- RNAlysis now uses a different implementation of the K-Medoids clustering algorithm, which should be more stable and faster than the previous implementation. However, note that the two implementations may give slightly different results.\n- When running differential expression or feature counting, RNAlysis session reports will automatically include a logfile with R session info.\n- Added optional parameters to all differential expression functions, allowing users to return a path to a logfile with R session info.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixed bug where table previews in the graphical interface would sometimes fail to update when applying functions inplace.\n",

        "description": "# 4.0.0 (2024-06-29)\n\nVersion 4.0.0 of RNAlysis introduces two major improvements:\nFirst, the software has switched from Pandas to Polars, which should substantially improve overall performance, particularly when generating automatic analysis reports.\n\nSecond, significant enhancements have been made to the automatic analysis reports.\nThese include new interactive features such as the ability to highlight analysis paths and filter the report by node types,\nimproved hierarchical layout for better readability, performance optimizations, and additional customization options.\nThe reports now offer a more comprehensive and user-friendly way to navigate and understand analysis workflows.\n\nThis update also includes various bug fixes and minor improvements to other functions within the software.\n\nHappy analysis!\n\n## Added\n\n- Added additional optional parameters to automatic report generation.\n- Added additional parameters to 'Hierarchical clustergram plot' (CountFilter.clustergram).\n\n## Changed\n\n- RNAlysis now uses Polars instead of Pandas. This change should improve the performance of RNAlysis by an order of magnitude, especially when generating automatic analysis reports.\n- Automatic analysis reports are now laid out in a hierarchical structure, making it easier to navigate through the report.\n- When clicking on a node in an automatic analysis report, the analysis path leading to that node will be highlighted.\n- When clicking on a legend node in an automatic analysis report, all nodes of that type will be highlighted.\n- The 'Hierarchical clustergram plot' function should now run faster on large datasets.\n- Added support for running tasks using 'sequential' backend on standalone releases of RNAlysis.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixed bug where the visualization functions 'Plot histogram of p-values' and 'Histogram of a column' would not display a graph immediately when using the stand-alone app.\n- Fixed bug re-loading a saved session report would sometimes lead to missing connections in the analysis flow graph.\n- Fixed bug where applying not-inplace operations to differential expression tables would change the expected name of the p-value column.\n- Fixed bug where table previews in automatic analysis reports would display an extra empty line.\n\n## Backwards-incompatible changes\n\n- Since RNAlysis now uses Polars instead of Pandas, all functions that previously returned Pandas DataFrames will now return Polars DataFrames. To keep your code compatible with the new version, you may need to adjust the way you interact with the returned DataFrames, or convert them back into Pandas DataFrames.\n- Sessions saved with previous versions of RNAlysis are mostly compatible with RNAlysis 4.0.0, but some of the new features of automatic analysis reports (such as highlighting the report by node type) may not work in older sessions.\n",

When loading a session created by *RNAlysis* 3.11 and beyond, you will have the option to resume the interactive report from the last saved state.\n\n## Changed\n\n- CutAdapt adapter trimming functions can now receive an optional \"new_filenames\" parameter, which allows users to specify the names of the output files.\n- Hierarchical clustergram plot (CountFilter.clustergram) now supports the 'colormap' parameter, which allows users to specify a custom color map for the plot.\n- Hierarchical clustergram plot (CountFilter.clustergram) now displays continuous values on the color bar, instead of discrete values.\n- Generally improved the looks of Hierarchical clustergram plot (CountFilter.clustergram).\n- Previously-added functions (such as ortholog/paralog mapping, biotype summary by GTF file, etc) can now be applied to gene sets. Previously, some of these functions could only be applied to data tables.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Function \"Summarize feature biotypes (based on a reference table)\" (biotypes_from_ref_table) now treats rows with missing values as \"\\_missing_from_biotype_reference\" instead of ignoring them entirely.\n- Fixed bug where the Ensembl paralog-finding function would appear under the wrong tab in the graphical interface.\n- Fixed bug where the description of the MA Plot function and parameters would not display correctly in the graphical interface.\n",

        "description": "# 3.10.0 (2023-10-31)\n\nI'm thrilled to introduce RNAlysis version 3.10.0.\nThis version includes features that were requested by users for a while, alongside quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.\nHere is a brief highlight of the most important additions:\n\n**Ortholog Mapping:** *RNAlysis* can now map genes to their closest orthologs in different organisms.\nYou can map genes to their orthologs using four different databases - Ensembl, Panther, PhylomeDB, and OrthoInspector - extracting both one-to-one and one-to-many ortholog relationships and filtering them based on their reliability.\n\n**Discovering Paralogs:** In the same vein, *RNAlysis* now facilitates the discovery of paralogs within a specific organism, using either the Ensembl or Panther databases.\n\n**New visualization and analysis options for Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** We've introduced new functions and parameters to allow you to get more out of your principal component analysis.\n\nI would also like to extend my personal apology for the delay in bringing you this update.\nDue to personal reasons, this release, originally scheduled for the end of August, took longer than expected.\nYour patience and support have been invaluable, and I'm eager to share these exciting additions with you.\nThank you for being a part of the RNAlysis community, and stay tuned for more updates in the near future!\n\n## Added\n\n- Added new functions to the filtering module that map genes to their closest orthologs in a different organism, using four different databases: Ensembl, Panther, PhylomeDB, and OrthoInspector.\n- Added new functions to the filtering module that find paralogs of genes in a given organism, using two different databases: Ensembl and Panther.\n- Added new function 'Sort table by contribution to a Principal Component (PCA)' (CountFilter.sort_by_principal_component), which allows sorting of genes in a count matrix by their contribution (gene loadings) to a principal component.\n- Added a new parameter called 'legend' to 'Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot' (CountFilter.pca), which allows users to display a legend on the PCA plot with a name for each sample group/color.\n\n## Changed\n\n- RNAlysis now issues a warning when users run PCA or PCA-based functions on an unnormalized count matrix.\n- The 'seek_fusion_genes' and 'learn_bias' arguments for kallisto quantification (fastq.kallisto_quant_single_end and fastq.kallisto_quant_paired_end), which were depracated in kallisto versions >0.48, are no longer displayed on the graphical interface. Old Pipelines that contain these arguments will still run, but new Pipelines will not contain them.\n- Long-running functions now run in the background even when the 'inplace' parameter is set to True, instead of freezing the entire graphical interface.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixed bug where functions would sometimes fail to run without displaying an error message.\n- Fixed bug where progress bars in the graphical interface would sometimes not disappear after reaching 100% completion.\n- RNAlysis should no longer display warning messages about graph layout when graphs are scaled down.\n- Fixed bug where the clustergram function (CountFilter.clustergram) would raise an error with specific sets of dependecy versions.\n- Loading tables no longer raises a depracation warning when using newer versions of Pandas.\n",

        "description": "# 3.8.0 (2023-05-07)\r\n\r\nVersion 3.8.0 of *RNAlysis* comes with several exciting new features, including the ability to generate interactive analysis reports automatically.\r\nThis feature allows users to create an interactive graph of all the datasets they loaded into RNAlysis, the functions applied, and the outputs generated during the analysis.\r\nYou can read more about this feature in the [Tutorial chapter](https://guyteichman.github.io/RNAlysis/build/tutorial.html#create-analysis-report) and the [User Guide chapter](https://guyteichman.github.io/RNAlysis/build/user_guide_gui.html#rnalysis-interactive-analysis-reports).\r\n\r\nThe new release also includes Pipelines for FASTQ functions, the ability to export normalization scaling factors, and other changes to improve the software's performance.\r\nRNAlysis now supports Python 3.11, and many functions should now run faster. The software's graphic interface has also improved significantly, and users will now see a clearer error message when attempting to load unsupported file formats.\r\nLastly, the release also fixes several bugs.\r\n\r\nPlease note that, since Python 3.7 will be reaching end of life as of June 2023, new versions of *RNAlysis* will no longer support it.\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n- You can now generate interactive analysis reports automatically using the RNAlysis graphical interface. Read more about this feature [here](https://guyteichman.github.io/RNAlysis/build/user_guide_gui.html).\r\n- Added Pipelines for the FASTQ module (SingleEndPipeline and PairedEndPipeline), allowing you to apply a series of functions (adapter trimming, alignment, quantification, etc) to a batch of sequence/alignment files.\r\n- Added new parameter 'return_scaling_factors' to normalization functions, that allows you to access the scaling factors calculated by RNAlysis.\r\n- Added new parameter 'gzip_output' to CutAdapt adapter trimming (fastq.trim_adapters_single_end and fastq.trim_adapters_paired_end), allowing users to determine whether or not the output files will be gzipped.\r\n\r\n## Changed\r\n\r\n- RNAlysis now supports Python 3.11, and no longer supports Python 3.7.\r\n- Many of the functions in RNAlysis should now run faster.\r\n- The RNAlysis graphic interface should now boot up significantly faster.\r\n- RNAlysis now shows an easier to understand error message when users attempt to load a table in an unsupported format (e.g. Excel files).\r\n- CutAdapt adapter trimming (fastq.trim_adapters_single_end and fastq.trim_adapters_paired_end) now outputs non-gzipped files by default.\r\n- Standardized all plotting functions in the filtering module to return a matplotlib Figure object, which can be further modified by users.\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n- RNAlysis failing to map gene IDs during GO enrichment analysis should no longer raise an error (thanks to [clockgene](https://github.com/clockgene) in [#16](https://github.com/GuyTeichman/RNAlysis/issues/16)).\r\n- Fixed bug where the Command History window would not display history of the current tab immediately after clearing the current session.\r\n- Fixed bug where adapter trimming would fail to run when using CutAdapt version >= 4.4.0.\r\n- Fixed bug where 'Filter rows with duplicate names/IDs' (Filter.filter_duplicate_ids) would raise an error when applied to some tables.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n- [clockgene] in [#16]\r\n",

        "description": "# 3.4.0 (2023-02-01)\n\nFrom this release forward, *RNAlysis* is made available as a stand-alone app for Windows and MacOS. You can download these stand-alone versions from the GitHub Releases page.\nIn addition, new features were added, including new plots, filtering functions, integration of the external tools bowtie2 and featureCounts, and the ability to generate Gene Ontology Graphs and KEGG Pathway Graphs without running enrichment analysis from scratch.\n\n## Added\n\n- Added a Scree Plot (explained variance per PC) to Principle Component Analysis\n- Added CountFilter.split_by_principal_component(), allowing users to filter genes based on their contributions (loadings) to PCA Principal Components.\n- Added Filter.drop_columns\n- Added support for the Sharpened Cosine distance metric in clustering analyses\n- KEGG enrichment can now generate KEGG pathway graphs for pathways that were found to be statistically significant\n- Added functions to the enrichment module that can generate KEGG Pathway or Gene Ontology plots based on previously-generated enrichment results\n- You can now clear the *RNAlysis* cache from the *RNAlysis* GUI, or through the general module.\n- Added bowtie2 alignment to the fastq module.\n- Added FeatureCounts feature-counting to the fastq module.\n- You can now choose whether or not to discard genes from enrichment analysis if they have no annotations associated with them.\n- Added sections to the programmatic user guide about the `fastq` module.\n\n## Changed\n\n- Replaced the 'parallel' parameter in enrichment functions with the 'parallel_backend' parameter, allowing users to choose which parallel backend (if any) will be used in the function.\n- Added 'parallel_backend' parameter to all clustering functions under the filtering module.\n- When generating Gene Ontology/KEGG Pathway graphs, users can choose whether or not to generate the figure in an additional separate file.\n- Updated type annotations of some functions to be more precise and helpful (for example, setting a lower bound on some int function parameters).\n- The colorbar ticks in enrichment bar plots now match the axis ticks on the main axis.\n- Slight improvements in GUI performance, stability, and looks.\n- Slight improvements in performance of enrichment analysis when examining a small number of attributes.\n- enrichment.plot_enrichment() was replaced by enrichment.enrichment_bar_plot().\n- CountFilter.differential_expression() has new optional parameter `output_folder`, which allows users to save the generated data tables and the R script that generated them into a specified folder.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- In CountFilter.differential_expression_deseq2(), fixed a bug where design matrix files with non-comma delimiters would cause an error (thanks to [Mintxoklet](https://github.com/Mintxoklet) in [#7](https://github.com/GuyTeichman/RNAlysis/issues/7))\n- Fixed bug where setup.py would install a directory named tests into site-packages folder (thanks to [Bipin Kumar](https://github.com/kbipinkumar) in [#9](https://github.com/GuyTeichman/RNAlysis/issues/9))\n- Fixed bug where the windows of some functions (differential expression, adapter trimming, etc) did not show a link to the function's documentation page.\n- Fixed typos in some parts of the *RNAlysis* documentation\n- When filtering a table by a single user-defined attribute, the automatic table name will now be more informative about the operation applied.\n- Fixed bug where occasionally a Pipeline or Function would generate multiple tables of the same name, but only one of them will appear in the GUI.\n- Fixed bug where occasionally significance asterisks on enrichment bar-plots would appear in the wrong location.\n- Fixed bug where fastq.create_kallisto_index() (Create Kallisto Index) would not make use of the `make_unique` parameter (thanks to Matthias Wilm)\n\n## Removed\n\n- Removed the previously-deprecated functions `enrichment.enrich_randomization()` and `enrichment.enrich_hypergeometric()`.\n\n## New Contributors\n\n- [Mintxoklet] in [#7]\n- [Bipin Kumar] in [#9]\n- Matthias Wilm\n",
