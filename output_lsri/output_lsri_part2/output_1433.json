The arrows in orange show that BioTIP is applied to cell state ensembles (clusters) without inputting the pseudo-order information. The dashed orange arrow shows that BioTIP may use pseudo-order information to visualize and interpret the results.   \nb, Overview of BioTIP\u2019s three analytical steps. The scRNA-seq profiles with cell cluster IDs are the inputs, which can be generated by independent pipelines.

The sizes of the statistical ensembles (e.g., cellular populations) vary considerably. BioTIP provides Ic.shrink score (an improved version on Ic score) to address the bias towards differently sized populations.\n2. Multiple tipping points may coexist during an observed progression and multiple CTSs may coexist in the same critical transition state. BioTIP can detect multiple tipping points and CTSs. \n3. Under exposure to a stimulus, the same population of cells faces multiple trajectories. BioTIP has robust performance for different trajectory inference methods. \n \n"

Dataset 1 consists of 96 selected genes in 929 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) of predefined 9 clusters ([Bargaje et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28167799/)). \n2. Dataset 2 consists of 10.3k genes in 131 mouse lung alveolar type (AT2) development, collected at four time points ([Treutlein et al., 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24739965/)). \n3. Dataset 3 consists of 10.9k genes of 7,240 developing mesoderm cells collected at embryonic day (E) 8.25 when precursor cells of major organs have been formed ([Pijuan-Sala et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30787436/)). \n4. Dataset 4 contained 12.7k genes in 11k E8.25 cells, with 16 predefined developing mesoderm subtypes ([Ibarra-Soria et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-017-0013-z)). \n5. Dataset 5 contained 15.2k genes of 1,531 mesoderm cells of embryoid bodies (EB), describing how hemangiogenic (HA) and smooth muscle lineages are specified from FLK1-expressing (FLK1+) mesoderm ([Zhao and Choi, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31740535/)). \n6. Dataset 6 is an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) data simulated from an established 18-gene regulatory network of 5,363 cells consisting of four stable states and between-state transition cells ([Sha et al., 2020](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/17/9505/5900115)). \n\nFor each dataset, cell-type biomarkers or cluster identities are given by the original publications.
