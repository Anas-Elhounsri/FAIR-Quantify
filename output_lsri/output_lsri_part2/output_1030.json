The pipeline takes an input list of DNA sequences in FASTA format, and after various screening steps, returns a list of orthogonal gRNAs. We have used sequences generated using [R2oDNA Designer](http://www.r2odna.com/), but a suitable library of FASTA sequences from any source could be used (e.g. from [NUPACK design](http://www.nupack.org/design) algorithm). Example R2oDNA Designer job specifications input files (see the example_r2o_jobSpecifications/ directory) generated FASTA sequences are included with this repository (see the directory ADD). \nThe associated publication for this software can be seen [here](http://) (gDesigner: computational design of synthetic gRNAs for Cpf-1-based transcriptional repression in mammalian cells (2018).

You now have a directory called something like r2o_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX where the X's are some sequence of random numbers.\n\nThe program can then be run with the command line:\n\n```\npython grna_design.py -p Paths.txt -s Settings.txt -i r2o_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -o grna_output.fa\n```\n\nwhere the Path.txt file is described above, the -i argument is location of the unpacked R2oDNA directory from the unpacked zip file, the -o argument is the output FASTA file for the final set of orthogonal sequences, and the Settings.txt contains the constraints the sequences need to satisfy in a tab-separated key/value format. Settings parameters are summarised in the following table:\n\n| Parameter  | Value type | Description |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| crispr_type | String (lbcpf1 or ascpf1 or cas9) | The CRISPR system being used |\n| offinder_compute_type | Character (C or G or A) | The Cas-OFFinder processor type (depends on your Cas-OFFinder installation, we recommend using graphics card acceleration using CUDA if possible)|\n| min_offinder_score_fwd | Float (0 to 1) | Off-target score in the forward direction |\n| min_offinder_score_rev | Float (0 to 1) | Off-target score in the reverse strand direction (probably unnecessary for most use cases so can be set to 0) |\n| offinder_max_mismatch | Integer | Cas-Offinder to return only hits with less than or equal to this number of mismatches|\n| melting_kconc | Float | K+ concentration for use in MELTING RNA:DNA hybrid free energy calculations|\n| melting_mgconc | Float | Mg2+ concentration for use in MELTING RNA:DNA hybrid free energy calculations |\n| melting_naconc | Float | Na+ for use in MELTING RNA:DNA hybrid free energy calculations |\n| melting_GFE_fwd_min | Float | MELTING RNA:DNA hybrid free energy minimum cutoff |\n| melting_GFE_fwd_max | Float | MELTING RNA:DNA hybrid free energy maximum cutoff |\n| melting_GFE_rev_min | Float | MELTING RNA:DNA hybrid free energy minimum cutoff in the reverse strand direction (probably unimportant for most use cases so can be set to a wide range) |\n| melting_GFE_rev_max | Float | MELTING RNA:DNA hybrid free energy maximum cutoff in the reverse strand direction (probably unimportant for most use cases so can be set to a wide range) |\n| max_submatch | Integer | Maximum length of substring match between different gRNA spacer sequences (used in maximum independent set search step) |\n| pf_inter_cutoff | Float | Minimum Pairfold folding free energy between different gRNA molecules (used in maximum independent set search step) |\n| sw_cutoff_for | Float | Smith-Waterman (ednafull matrix) maximum score cutoff (used in maximum independent set search step) |\n| sw_cutoff_rev | Float | Smith-Waterman (ednafull matrix) maximum score cutoff in the reverse strand direction (used in maximum independent set search step) |\n\nSome examples Settings files are provided in the distribution (e.g. see Settings_lbcpf1.txt).\n"
