Models should be version-controlled such that changes can be tracked and if\n   necessary reverted. Ideally, they should be available through a public\n   repository such as GitHub that will allow other researchers to inspect,\n   share, and contribute to the model.\n2. Models should, for the benefit of the community and for research gain, live\n   up to certain standards and minimal functionality. \nAnd in order to make this process as easy as possible the generated repository\ncan easily be integrated with continuous integration testing providers such as\nTravis CI, which means that anytime you push a model change to GitHub, the test\nsuite will be run automatically and a report will be available for you to look\nat via GitHub pages for your repository. \n"
