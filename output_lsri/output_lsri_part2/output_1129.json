        "value": "Radiotherapy research typically uses dose-volume histograms (DVHs), which condense 3D dose distributions within a region of interest (ROI) into a 2D representation, as their main source of dosimetric data for dose-outcome studies. However, DVHs lack spatial information, making it difficult to identify specific sub regions or dose-spread patterns in organs that can be indicative of higher risk of adverse events. Dose-surface maps (DSMs) preserve this spatial information and make it possible to identify spatio-dosimetric features on the surface of any ROI. \nDSMs are most commonly used for hollow, tubular organs (like the esophagus and rectum) to characterize the dose to the actual tissue wall and ignore dose to the filling contents. They can be thought of as tubes painted with dose information that have been cut open to allow them to lay flat as a 2D dose map. Simplistically, all that is required to create a DSM is some representation of the organ (like a 3D contour) and a dose field with which to paint it. In reality, the process includes several steps where the organ is (1) segmented into slices, (2) dose is sampled at N points around each slice, and (3) the slices are cut open to produce the 2D map. \nDifferent research groups have developed different approaches for each of these steps, with the largest methodological variation being how slices are defined. The simpler method, popularized by Buettner *et al* and referred to as planar slicing in the package, creates slices of the ROI on the same axial planes that house the slices of the CT/MR image the contour was drawn on. While most common due to its simplicity, it ignores any curvature of the organ and may not produce appropriate representations of the surface dose for organs with high curvature. The more complex method accounts for the organ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s curvature and uses sampling planes perpendicular to the central path of the organ and is heretofore referred to as nonplanar slicing in the package. Because the nonplanar approach does not use parallel slicing planes additional checks are required to detect and adjust slices that overlap with one another that can be difficult to implement. For this reason only a few groups have developed (private) code for this method, such as Hoogeman *et al* and Witztum *et al*. \n**rtdsm** facilitates the calculation of DSMs with both types of slicing methods to empower researchers to pursue either option, regardless of their programming ability.\n \n"
