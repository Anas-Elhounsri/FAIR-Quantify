        "value": "This approach to detection of clinically relevant variants in ALL utilises jellyfish (https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish) and a k-mer variant detection software 'km' (https://github.com/iric-soft/km). Additionally, RaScALL provides targets designed for detection of ALL specific gene fusions and variants. Within this repository there are targets developed for detection of recurrently observed in-frame gene fusions as well as pathogenic SNVs, with additional targets for detection of intragenic deletions of _IKZF1_ and _ERG_. Targets have also been developed for detection of _IGH-EPOR_ and _IGH-CRLF2_ as well as detection of _DUX4_ expression indicative of a _DUX4_-rearrangement.  \nTogether these tools can rapidly detect the presence of many ALL specific genomic alterations from raw RNA-seq data (fastq). The instructions below will enable installation of both km & jellyfish as well as provide a simple script to perform variant detection from fastq files. Incorporation of R and samtools into the environment enables the user to generate their own custom target sequences for variant detection. \n"

        "value": "While the targets provided represent commonly observed fusions and clinically relevant sequence variants this list is not complete. ALL is a highly heterogenous disease and a large number of rare or novel fusions have been identified and implicated in disease development and progression. Furthermore, research is regularly identifying additional clinically relevant variants. To enable users to generate their own list of desired fusion/SNV/InDels for investigation we have generated two scripts for producing user defined fusions and sequence variants. This script requires a gtf file and associated reference genome. \nTo generate custom fusion targets a tab separated text file listing the genes, transcript identifier and exons involved in the fusion as well as desired length of targets is needed. Columns within the text file should represent: \n      1. Gene name of 5' fusion partner; \n      2. Transcript identifier for the 5' fusion partern transcript to be utilised for generating the target; \n      3. Exon range listing exons that are  likely break-points for 5' fusion partner; \n      4. Gene name of 3' fusion partner; \n      5. Transcript identifier for the 5' fusion partern transcript to be utilised for generating the target; \n      6. Exon range listing exons that are likely break-points for 3' fusion partner; \n      7. Desired target length (Note 62 is the minimum target length for k-mer size 31. Longer targets can be specified (e.g. 100 or 150 but must be an even number). \nNote that the gene_id (transcript identifier) needs to be present in the gtf file and version you provide for creating target sequences. If utilising an ensembl gtf file then replace with the ensembl transcript_id for the gene of interest. \nThis script currently accepts __UCSC__ and __Ensembl__ GTF and reference genomes. The user can either add the additional fusion targets to the ALL_targets/Fusion directory or specify an alternate directory location for writing generated target sequences. \nTo generate custom sequence variant targets a tab separated text file listing the gene name, transcript identifier and amino acid positions to target is required. Targets can be generated to span more than one amino acid position, but it is advised that the number of amino acids assessed in a give target be limited to 3-5. Targets _cannot_ be generated for the first 11 amino acids in a gene as this requires inclusion of bases from the 5' UTR. \n"

You can install jellyfish and km yourself using instructions from https://github.com/iric-soft/km, or use the install_km_Release13.sh script included to complete this step. NOTE: The procedure below requires that the command-line utility 'curl' be installed on your machine.\n```\nconda create -n RaScALL python=3.7 virtualenv -y\nconda activate RaScALL\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nconda install samtools==1.11\n```\n2. Next we will clone the git repository containing the targets generated for detecting ALL specific fusions/variants as well as bash scripts to install and run km against these targets. \n```\ngit clone https://github.com/j-rehn/RaScALL.git\n```\n3. Now we can install the km/jellyfish components using the `install.sh` script. First we change into the RaScALL directory generated by git, or an alternate directory for the git-repository if one was spcified. We then run the install script km and jellyfish will be isntalled into this directory. Note the install script requires `curl` be installed on your machine. \n```\ncd RaScALL\nbash install_km_Release13.sh\n```\n4. Finally, we wish to install R into the conda environment to allow use of Rscripts to filter output from km and also generate custom target sequences. If you already have R installed and in the path then this step may not be required.\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge r-base r-essentials\n```\n \n"

Modify the command to specify the path to location of own fastq files as well as location of directory containing SNV targets. As jellyfish is an in-memory k-mer counting algorithm memory requirements for will depend on size of the fastq files. Increasing the number of available threads decreases the run-time. 12 threads can be used succesfully for smaller fastq files (e.g. 75b length 60M reads) but it is suggested this be reduced for much larger files at the expense of additional run-time.\n\n```\nbash run_km.sh testSample_1.fastq.gz testSample_2.fastq.gz 12 ALL_targets/SNV\n```\n\nThis script generates a subdirectory within `RaScALL` called `output` for output files. Within this k-mer count tables from jellyfish and text files generated by km for a given sample/targetType will be written into a sample directory labelled with basename of the fastq files.\n\n```\nls output/testSample/\ncountTable31.jf  testSample_SNV.txt\n```\n\n3. Separate .txt files are generated with output from each of the target directories (SNV.txt, Fusion.txt, focal_deletion.txt, DUX4.txt and IGH_fusion.txt). These additional outputs can be generated by altering the \\[TARGET_TYPE] argument as follows:\n\n```\nbash run_km.sh testSample_1.fastq.gz testSample_2.fastq.gz 12 ALL_targets/Fusion\nbash run_km.sh testSample_1.fastq.gz testSample_2.fastq.gz 12 ALL_targets/focal_deletions\nbash run_km.sh testSample_1.fastq.gz testSample_2.fastq.gz 12 ALL_targets/DUX4\nbash run_km.sh testSample_1.fastq.gz testSample_2.fastq.gz 12 ALL_targets/IGH_fusion  # Note much longer run time.\n\nls output/sampleA/\ncountTable31.jf  testSampleA_DUX4.txt  testSample_final_variants.csv  testSample_focal_deletions.txt  testSample_Fusion.txt  testSample_IGH_fusion.txt  testSample_SNV.txt\n```\n\nProducing the k-mer count table (countTable31.jf) is generally the rate limiting step of the process. The `run_km.sh` script therefore checks for the presence of the `countTable31.jf` first and if present does not re-generate this file but simply performs a `wc -l` command to read the data into memory.\n\nThe final target set 'IGH_fusion' contains the greatest number of targets given the highly variable nature of _IGH-CRLF2_ and _IGH-EPOR_ rearrangements. Run times against this target set are therefore substantially longer. For samples with 75b length and 60M read depth run-time ~6 mins for IGH_fusion targets vs a few seconds for testing other target sets, but can be much larger when using sequencing data of greater length/depth.\n"
