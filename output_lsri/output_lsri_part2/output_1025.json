As shown in the following illustration, PiLSL consists of three steps to learn the representations of pairwise interactions. First, we construct an enclosing graph for each pair of genes from a knowledge graph (KG). Secondly, we design an attentive embedding propagation layer in a GNN to discriminate the importance among the edges in the enclosing graph and learn the latent features of the pairwise interaction from the weighted enclosing graph. Finally, we further fuse the latent and explicit (multi-omics) features to obtain powerful representations for SL prediction. \n"
