LoMA lays out long reads after some filterations. It divides the layout into multiple blocks to make partial consensus sequences. They will be contatenated into one consensus sequence.\n\nNote:  \nThe current version is optimized for ONT reads although it can also be used for PacBio data.  \nThe following instructions assume users of linux-like OS. Users who use Windows are recommended to use WSL to run commands.  \nLoMA needs minimap2 (Heng Li) and MAFFT (Katoh et al.), so users please install them beforehand.  \nTypically, LoMA takes 10-1000 reads.\n"

Please make an input directory which contains at least one FASTQ file for which you want to obtain consensus sequence(s).   \n  \n-O: <PATH> output directory (absolute path). LoMA generates a consensus sequence for each input. The final sequences will be stored in a directory named \"CONSENSUS\", which will be made in the process.  \n  \n-b: <INT> block size. This is the window size. When LoMA makes a consensus sequene, it divides the whole region into pieces. (default=3000)  \n  \n-s: <INT> step size. This is the step size of blocks. (default=2000)  \n  \n-h: <INT> The number of reads for both ends' truncation. Both ends of a region typically have a lower depth, so LoMA limits the area constructed. It can be changed according to the size of users' data. (default=10)  \n  \n-d: <INT> The number of sigma in read classification. Users usually do not need to change this parameter. (default=3)  \n  \n-l: <ont/pb> Data. Nanopore (ONT) or PacBio. (default=ont)  \n  \n-c: <INT> Minimum coverage rate of a block. (default=0.7)  \n  \n-r: <FLOAT> A parameter for data filtering by alignment accuracy's rank (discard 100*x% of alignments). (default=0.5)   \n"
