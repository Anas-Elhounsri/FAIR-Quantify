This document will amended periodically to keep it up-to-date, and in case of any dispute, the most current version will apply.\n\nAn up-to-date list of members of the nf-core core team can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/about). Our current safety officer is Renuka Kudva.\n\nnf-core is a young and growing community that welcomes contributions from anyone with a shared vision for [Open Science Policies](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/taxonomy/term/8). Open science policies encompass inclusive behaviours and we strive to build and maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals.\n\nWe have therefore adopted this code of conduct (CoC), which we require all members of our community and attendees in nf-core events to adhere to in all our workspaces at all times. Workspaces include but are not limited to Slack, meetings on Zoom, Jitsi, YouTube live etc.\n\nOur CoC will be strictly enforced and the nf-core team reserve the right to exclude participants who do not comply with our guidelines from our workspaces and future nf-core activities.\n\nWe ask all members of our community to help maintain a supportive and productive workspace and to avoid behaviours that can make individuals feel unsafe or unwelcome. Please help us maintain and uphold this CoC.\n\nQuestions, concerns or ideas on what we can include? Contact safety [at] nf-co [dot] re\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nThe safety officer is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.\n\nThe safety officer in consultation with the nf-core core team have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nMembers of the core team or the safety officer who violate the CoC will be required to recuse themselves pending investigation. They will not have access to any reports of the violations and be subject to the same actions as others in violation of the CoC.\n\n## When are where does this Code of Conduct apply?\n\nParticipation in the nf-core community is contingent on following these guidelines in all our workspaces and events. This includes but is not limited to the following listed alphabetically and therefore in no order of preference:\n\n- Communicating with an official project email address.\n- Communicating with community members within the nf-core Slack channel.\n- Participating in hackathons organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events).\n- Participating in collaborative work on GitHub, Google Suite, community calls, mentorship meetings, email correspondence.\n- Participating in workshops, training, and seminar series organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events). This applies to events hosted on web-based platforms such as Zoom, Jitsi, YouTube live etc.\n- Representing nf-core on social media. This includes both official and personal accounts.\n\n## nf-core cares \ud83d\ude0a\n\nnf-core's CoC and expectations of respectful behaviours for all participants (including organisers and the nf-core team) include but are not limited to the following (listed in alphabetical order):\n\n- Ask for consent before sharing another community member\u2019s personal information (including photographs) on social media.\n- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We are all here to learn from one another and a difference in opinion can present a good learning opportunity.\n- Celebrate your accomplishments at events! (Get creative with your use of emojis \ud83c\udf89 \ud83e\udd73 \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\ude4c !)\n- Demonstrate empathy towards other community members. (We don\u2019t all have the same amount of time to dedicate to nf-core. If tasks are pending, don\u2019t hesitate to gently remind members of your team. If you are leading a task, ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.)\n- Engage with and enquire after others. (This is especially important given the geographically remote nature of the nf-core community, so let\u2019s do this the best we can)\n- Focus on what is best for the team and the community. (When in doubt, ask)\n- Graciously accept constructive criticism, yet be unafraid to question, deliberate, and learn.\n- Introduce yourself to members of the community. (We\u2019ve all been outsiders and we know that talking to strangers can be hard for some, but remember we\u2019re interested in getting to know you and your visions for open science!)\n- Show appreciation and **provide clear feedback**. (This is especially important because we don\u2019t see each other in person and it can be harder to interpret subtleties. Also remember that not everyone understands a certain language to the same extent as you do, so **be clear in your communications to be kind.**)\n- Take breaks when you feel like you need them.\n- Using welcoming and inclusive language. (Participants are encouraged to display their chosen pronouns on Zoom or in communication on Slack.)\n\n## nf-core frowns on \ud83d\ude15\n\nThe following behaviours from any participants within the nf-core community (including the organisers) will be considered unacceptable under this code of conduct. Engaging or advocating for any of the following could result in expulsion from nf-core workspaces.\n\n- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following and sustained disruption of communication among participants of the community. This includes hijacking shared screens through actions such as using the annotate tool in conferencing software such as Zoom.\n- \u201cDoxing\u201d i.e. posting (or threatening to post) another person\u2019s personal identifying information online.\n- Spamming or trolling of individuals on social media.\n- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes and unwelcome sexual attention.\n- Verbal and text comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or work experience.\n\n### Online Trolling\n\nThe majority of nf-core interactions and events are held online. Unfortunately, holding events online comes with the added issue of online trolling. This is unacceptable, reports of such behaviour will be taken very seriously, and perpetrators will be excluded from activities immediately.\n\nAll community members are required to ask members of the group they are working within for explicit consent prior to taking screenshots of individuals during video calls.\n\n## Procedures for Reporting CoC violations\n\nIf someone makes you feel uncomfortable through their behaviours or actions, report it as soon as possible.\n\nYou can reach out to members of the [nf-core core team](https://nf-co.re/about) and they will forward your concerns to the safety officer(s).\n\nIssues directly concerning members of the core team will be dealt with by other members of the core team and the safety manager, and possible conflicts of interest will be taken into account. nf-core is also in discussions about having an ombudsperson, and details will be shared in due course.\n\nAll reports will be handled with utmost discretion and confidentially.\n\n## Attribution and Acknowledgements\n\n- The [Contributor Covenant, version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4)\n- The [OpenCon 2017 Code of Conduct](http://www.opencon2017.org/code_of_conduct) (CC BY 4.0 OpenCon organisers, SPARC and Right to Research Coalition)\n- The [eLife innovation sprint 2020 Code of Conduct](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/code-of-conduct/)\n- The [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines v3.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) (version 3.1, CC BY-SA 3.0 Mozilla)\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.0 - March 12th, 2021\n\n- Complete rewrite from original [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) CoC.\n"

Check that there isn't already an issue about your idea in the [ViroProfiler issues](https://github.com/rujinlong/viroprofiler/issues) to avoid duplicating work. If there isn't one already, please create one so that others know you're working on this\n2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [ViroProfiler repository](https://github.com/rujinlong/viroprofiler) to your GitHub account\n3. Make the necessary changes / additions within your forked repository following [Pipeline conventions](#pipeline-contribution-conventions)\n4. Use `nf-core schema build` and add any new parameters to the pipeline JSON schema (requires [nf-core tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools) >= 1.10).\n5. Submit a Pull Request against the `dev` branch and wait for the code to be reviewed and merged\n\nIf you're not used to this workflow with git, you can start with some [docs from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) or even their [excellent `git` resources](https://try.github.io/).\n\n## Patch\n\n:warning: Only in the unlikely and regretful event of a release happening with a bug.\n\n- On your own fork, make a new branch `patch` based on `upstream/master`.\n- Fix the bug, and bump version (X.Y.Z+1).\n- A PR should be made on `master` from patch to directly this particular bug.\n\n## Getting help\n\nFor further information/help, please consult the [ViroProfiler documentation](https://deng-lab.github.io/viroprofiler/) and [issues](https://github.com/deng-lab/viroprofiler/issues).\n\n## Pipeline contribution conventions\n\nTo make the ViroProfiler code and processing logic more understandable for new contributors and to ensure quality, we semi-standardise the way the code and other contributions are written.\n\n### Adding a new step\n\nIf you wish to contribute a new step, please use the following coding standards:\n\n1. Define the corresponding input channel into your new process from the expected previous process channel\n2. Write the process block (see below).\n3. Define the output channel if needed (see below).\n4. Add any new parameters to `nextflow.config` with a default (see below).\n5. Add any new parameters to `nextflow_schema.json` with help text (via the `nf-core schema build` tool).\n6. Add sanity checks and validation for all relevant parameters.\n7. Perform local tests to validate that the new code works as expected.\n8. If applicable, add a new test command in `.github/workflow/ci.yml`.\n9. Update MultiQC config `assets/multiqc_config.yml` so relevant suffixes, file name clean up and module plots are in the appropriate order. If applicable, add a [MultiQC](https://https://multiqc.info/) module.\n10. Add a description of the output files and if relevant any appropriate images from the MultiQC report to `docs/output.md`.\n\n### Default values\n\nParameters should be initialised / defined with default values in `nextflow.config` under the `params` scope.\n\nOnce there, use `nf-core schema build` to add to `nextflow_schema.json`.\n\n### Default processes resource requirements\n\nSensible defaults for process resource requirements (CPUs / memory / time) for a process should be defined in `conf/base.config`. These should generally be specified generic with `withLabel:` selectors so they can be shared across multiple processes/steps of the pipeline. A nf-core standard set of labels that should be followed where possible can be seen in the [nf-core pipeline template](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/master/nf_core/pipeline-template/conf/base.config), which has the default process as a single core-process, and then different levels of multi-core configurations for increasingly large memory requirements defined with standardised labels.\n\nThe process resources can be passed on to the tool dynamically within the process with the `${task.cpu}` and `${task.memory}` variables in the `script:` block.\n\n### Naming schemes\n\nPlease use the following naming schemes, to make it easy to understand what is going where.\n\n- initial process channel: `ch_output_from_<process>`\n- intermediate and terminal channels: `ch_<previousprocess>_for_<nextprocess>`\n\n### Nextflow version bumping\n\nIf you are using a new feature from core Nextflow, you may bump the minimum required version of nextflow in the pipeline with: `nf-core bump-version --nextflow . [min-nf-version]`\n\n### Images and figures\n\nFor overview images and other documents we follow the nf-core [style guidelines and examples](https://nf-co.re/developers/design_guidelines).\n"

Please, for installing these tools refer to their manual.\n\n## Downloading the pipeline\n\nYou can easily get a copy of the pipeline or update with:\n\n```bash\n# download or update to the latest version\nnextflow pull deng-lab/viroprofiler\n\n# download a specific version (ex. 1.0)\nnextflow pull deng-lab/viroprofiler -r v1.0\n\n# download a specific branch (ex. dev)\nnextflow pull deng-lab/viroprofiler -r dev\n```\n\n!!! warning\n    \n    The pipeline requires a UNIX system, therefore, Windows users may successfully use this pipeline via the [Linux subsystem for window](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/wsl/install-win10). Nextflow team has made available a [nice tutorial](https://www.nextflow.io/blog.html) about this issue.\n\n## Downloading docker images\n\nThe docker images used by the pipeline are:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-base        ;\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-binning     ;\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-abundance   ;\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-geneannot   ;\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-vibrant     ;\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-taxa        ;\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-host        ;\ndocker pull denglab/viroprofiler-replicyc    ;\n```\n\n!!! info \"Using singularity\"\n\n    Docker and singularity images are downloaded on the fly. Be sure to properly set `NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR` env variable to a writable directory if using Singularity. This will make that the downloaded images are resuable through different executions. Read more at: https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html#singularity-docker-hub\n\n    For example, to download the images for singularity you may:\n\n    ```bash\n    # apply this command to each image\n    # just change the \"/\" and \":\" to \"-\".\n    # ex. Image denglab/viroprofiler-base becomes denglab-viroprofiler-base.img\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-base.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-base:latest\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-binning.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-binning:latest\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-abundance.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-abundance:latest\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-geneannot.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-geneannot:latest\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-vibrant.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-vibrant:latest\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-taxa.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-taxa:latest\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-host.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-host:latest\n    singularity pull --dir $NXF_SINGULARITY_LIBRARYDIR denglab-viroprofiler-replicyc.img docker://denglab/viroprofiler-replicyc:latest\n    ```\n\n## Testing your installation\n\nAfter that, you can run the pipeline with a testing dataset by selecting one of the available profiles: \n\n1. Docker\n    * `nextflow run denglab/viroprofiler -profile docker,test`\n2. Singularity\n    * `nextflow run denglab/viroprofiler -profile singularity,test`\n\n!!! note \"About NF profiles\"\n\n    Please read more about how to [proper select NF profiles](profiles.md#) to better understand it."

Install one of the supported container engines using **root** privileges:\n\n   - [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-installation-steps)\n   - [Charliecloud](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/install.html)\n   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n   - [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)\n   - [Shifter](https://github.com/NERSC/shifter)\n\n2. Install [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n\n3. Install Nextflow using conda:\n\n   ```bash\n   # You may need to restart your terminal before running the following commands\n   conda install -c bioconda nextflow\n   ```\n\n4. Download the pipeline and database.\n\n   ```bash\n   # setup database\n   nextflow run deng-lab/viroprofiler -r main -profile singularity --mode \"setup\"\n   ```\n\n   `-profile` specifies the container engine to use. You can use `singularity`, `charliecloud`, `docker`, `podman`, or `shifter`. You can also use `test` to run the pipeline with test data after setting up the database.\n\n5. Run the pipeline,\n\n   ```bash\n   # run test\n   nextflow run deng-lab/viroprofiler -r main -profile singularity,test\n\n   # run your own data\n   nextflow run deng-lab/viroprofiler -r main -profile singularity --input samplesheet.csv\n   ```\n\n6. Update the pipeline,\n\n   ```bash\n   nextflow pull deng-lab/viroprofiler\n   ```\n\n   Please refer to the [tutorial](https://deng-lab.github.io/viroprofiler/tutorial) for more information on how to run the pipeline with customized parameters and options.\n"
