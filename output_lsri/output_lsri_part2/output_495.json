The populations include the traditional BC1, BC2, and F2 in inbred lines as well as a hybrid population (CP) in outbred species. It takes three steps as following to finish the whole work.  \n           1. Generating parental InDel catalogs;  \n           2. Calling InDel genotypes across a hybrid population;  \n           3.

        "value": "To run InDelGT, users have to download and install the necessary software packages, including [BWA](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/releases/tag/v0.7.17) and [SAMtools( with BCFtools)](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), and prepare a parameter setting file, namely `parameters.ini`. The parameter file consists of three parts: folders, parameters and data files. The first part \u2018folders\u2019 gives the software paths of InDelGT itself, BWA, SAMtools, and BCFtools, as well as the path of data files including the reference fasta file and the fastq data files of the two parents and all their progeny. The second part \u2018parameters\u2019 includes the minimum score of InDel genotypes, the minimum score of the mapping quality of reads, the percentage of missing genotypes, the reads depth of heterozygote and homozygote\uff0cthe minimum *P*-value allowed for testing the segregation ratio at a InDel site and the number of threads used for parallel computing. The third part \u2018data files\u2019 presents the fasta file of the reference genome and the first and second read files of the two parents and all their progeny. A typical parameter file looks as following:  \n\n    [folders]\n    BWA_FOLD:/home/pan/bwa-0.7.17\n    SAMTOOLS_FOLD:/home/pan/samtools-1.9\n    BCFTOOLS_FOLD:/home/pan/bcftools-1.9\n    INDELGT_FOLD:/home/pan/InDelGT-1.0\n    DATAFOLD:/home/pan/sample\n    [parameters]\n    # the minimum score of InDel genotypes\n    GQ:30\n    # the minimum score of the mapping quality of reads\n    MAPQ:5\n    # the number of progeny\n    PROGENY_NUMBER:20\n    # percent of missing genotypes at each InDel\n    MISPCT:20\n    HETEROZYGOUS_DEPTH:3\n    HOMOZYGOUS_DEPTH:5\n    PVALUE:0.01\n    THREADS:20\n    [data files]\n    REFERENCE_FILE:reference.fasta\n    #When the population is BC population, PARENT1 is the heterozygous parent and PARENT2 is the homozygous parent.\n    PARENT1:female.R1.fq  female.R2.fq\n    PARENT2:male.R1.fq  male.R2.fq\n    PROGENY1: sample01.R1.fq  sample01.R2.fq\n    PROGENY2: sample02.R1.fq  sample02.R2.fq\n    PROGENY3: sample03.R1.fq  sample03.R2.fq\n    ......\n    PROGENY19: sample19.R1.fq  sample19.R2.fq\n    PROGENY20: sample20.R1.fq  sample20.R2.fq\n\n  Additionally, users need to install several perl modules, including `Parallel::ForkManager`, `Getopt::Long` and `Statistics::Distributions`. The modules can be easily installed with the module of [cpan](https://www.cpan.org/) if it is installed in advance.  \n  When the required software packages are installed and the parameter file is parepared and saved in a work directory, you can go to the work directory and get started with the command:  \n  `perl PathToInDelGT/InDelGT.pl -o directory`\n    \n  Since it will take quite a few hours or even several days to finish a pratical computing, we usually run the command in background as  \n  `nohup perl PathToInDelGT/InDelGT.pl -o directory &`\n\n  You can run with the 'help' option (`perl PathToInDelGT/InDelGT.pl -h`) to show the usage of InDelGT:\n\n        Usage: perl InDelGT.pl [Options] <type> -o <directory>\n        \n        Options:\n                --nocatalog     skip the first step for generating parental InDel catalog\n                --nocall        skip the second step for calling InDel genotypes for all progeny\n                --nofilter      skip the third step for analyzing and filtering InDel genotype data\n                -p  <type>      the type of population: CP;BC1;BC2;F2 (default: CP)\n                -o <directory>  create a directory for storing output file of the InDel genotyping results  \n                --help|h        help  "
