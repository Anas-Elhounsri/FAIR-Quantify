Moreover, it\nprovides an easy-to-use CLI and\n`web server <https://psm-utils.streamlitapp.com/>`_ to\nconvert search engine results from\none PSM file format into another. \n\nGoals and non-goals\n*******************\n- To provide an easy-to-use Python API for **handling PSMs**.\n- To provide a unified Python API to the plethora of **proteomics search engine\n  output formats** that are in existence.\n- To follow **community standards**: psm_utils pragmatically adheres to the\n  standards developed by the\n  `HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative <http://psidev.info>`_, such as\n  `ProForma 2.0 <https://psidev.info/proforma>`_ , the\n  `Universal Spectrum Identifier <https://psidev.info/usi>`_, and\n  `mzIdentML <https://psidev.info/mzidentml>`_\n- To be **open and dynamic**: psm_utils is fully open source, under the\n  permissive Apache 2.0 license.

See\n  `Contributing <https://psm-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing>`_\n  for more information.\n- **NOT to reinvent the wheel**: Instead, psm_utils heavily makes\n  use of packages such as `pyteomics <http://pyteomics.readthedocs.io/>`_ and\n  `psims <https://github.com/mobiusklein/psims>`_ that have existing\n  functionality for reading and/or writing PSM files. ``psm_utils.io``\n  provides a unified, higher level Python API build on top of these packages. \n`psm_utils online <https://psm-utils.streamlitapp.com/>`_\nis a Streamlit-based web server built on top of the psm_utils Python package. It allows\nyou to easily retrieve proteomics PSM statistics for any supported PSM file type, and to\nconvert search engine results from one PSM file format into  another.

        "description": "### Added\r\n- `io`: Add reader for [Sage](https://github.com/lazear/sage) PSM files.\r\n- `io.mzid`: Add reading/writing of PEP and q-values (might not always work yet due to the many ways of encoding these values in mzIdentML; please provide feedback)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- `psm`: The default values of `PSM.provenance_data`, `PSM.metadata` and `PSM.rescoring_features` are now `dict()` instead of `None`.\r\n- `PSMList`: Also allow Numpy integers for indexing a single PSM\r\n- `io.mzid.MzidReader`: Attempt to parse `retention time` or `scan start time` cvParams from both SpectrumIdentificationResult as SpectrumIdentificationItem levels. Note that according to the mzIdentML specification document (v1.1.1) neither cvParams are expected to be present at either level.\r\n- `io.mzid.MzidReader`: Prefer `spectrum title` cvParam over `spectrumID` attribute for `PSM.spectrum_id` as these titles always match to the peak list files. In this case, `spectrumID` is saved in `metadata[\"mzid_spectrum_id\"]`. Fall back to `spectrumID` if `spectrum title` is absent.\r\n- `io.mzid.MzidWriter`: `PSM.retention_time` is now written as cvParam `retention time` instead of `scan start time`, and to the `SpectrumIdentificationItem` level instead of the `SpectrumIdentificationResult` level, as theoretically in psm_utils, multiple PSMs for the same spectrum can have different values for `retention_time`.\r\n- `io.mzid.MzidWriter`: Write PSM score as cvParam `search engine specific score` instead of userParam `score`.\r\n- `io.percolator.PercolatorTabWriter`: For PIN-style files: Use `SpecId` instead of `PSMId` and write `PSMScore` and `ChargeN` columns by default.\r\n- Filter warnings from `psims.mzmlb` on import, as `mzmlb` is not used\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- `psm`: Fix missing qvalue and pep in docstring\r\n- `peptidoform`: ProForma mass modifications are now correctly parsed within the `rename_modifications` function.\r\n- `io.maxquant.MSMSReader`: Correctly parse empty `Proteins` column to `None`\r\n- `io.percolator.PercolatorTabReader`: Correctly parse Percolator peptidoform notation if no leading or trailing amino acids are present (e.g. `.ACDK.` instead of `K.ACDK.E`).\r\n- `io.percolator.PercolatorTabWriter`: ScanNr is now correctly written as an integer counting from the first PSM in the file.\r\n- `io.percolator.PercolatorTabWriter`: If no protein information is present, write the peptidoform preceded by `PEP_` to the Proteins column.\r\n- `io.idxml`: Read metadata as strings\r\n- `io.mzid.MzidReader`: Set `PSM.retention_time` to `None` instead of `float('nan')` if missing from the PSM file.\r\n- `io.mzid`: Fix reading of file if charge is missing\r\n- `io.mzid`: Fix writing if protein_list is None\r\n- `io.mzid`: Consider all `PeptideEvidence` entries for a `SpectrumIdentificationItem` to determine `is_decoy`\r\n- `io.mzid`: Fix handling of mzIdentML files when `is_decoy` field is not present (fixes #30)\r\n- `io.tsv`: Raise `PSMUtilsIOException` with clear error message when TSV `protein_list` cannot be read\r\n",
