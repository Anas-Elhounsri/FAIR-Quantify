These files can be read, copied, removed, edited, etc. as normal files, and any alteration will be reflected on the original FASTA file when fusta is closed.\n*** =append=\nThis folder should be used to add new sequences to the mounted FASTA file. Any valid fasta file copied or moved to this directory will be appended to the original FASTA files. It should be noted that the process is completely transparent and the the folder will remain empty, even though the operation is successful.\n*** =get=\nThis folder is used for range-access to the sequences in the mounted FASTA file. Although it is empty, any read access to a (non-existing) file following the pattern =SEQID:START-END= will return the corresponding range (1-indexed, fully-closed) in the specified sequence. It should be noted that the access skip headers and newlines, so that the =START-END= coordinates map to actual loci in the corresponding sequence and not to bytes in the mounted FASTA file.\n** Examples\nAll the following examples assume that a FASTA file has been mounted (/e.g./ =fusta -D genome.fa=), and is unmounted after manipulation (/e.g./ =fusermount -u fusta=).\n*** Get an overview of the file content \n"

If you wish to use FUSTA on compressed (multi)FASTA files, we recommend to use [[https://github.com/yhoogstrate/fastafs][FASTAFS]] as an intermediary to expose a compressed (multi)FASTA file to FUSTA without requiring to ully uncompress it.\n** Runtime options\n#+begin_src\nUSAGE:\n    fusta [OPTIONS] <FASTA> \nOPTIONS:\n    -C, --max-cache <max-cache>      Set the maximum amount of memory to use to cache writes (MB)\n                                     [default: 500]\n        --cache <cache>              Use either mmap, fseek(2) or memory-backed cache to extract\n                                     sequences from FASTA files.

The performances will probably be the worse, but memory consumption will be kept to the minimal.\n- =mmap= :: this mode is extremely similar to the previous one, safe that access will proceed through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap][mmmap(2)]] reads, leveraging the caching facilities of the OS -- this is the default mode.\n- =memory= :: in this mode, all fragments will directly be copied to memory. Performances will be at their best, but enough memory should be available to store the entirety of the processed files.\n* Troubleshooting\n*** I get a \"Cannot allocate memory\" error\nThe FASTA files may be overflowing the default setting of the memory overcommit guard. You may change the overcommiting setting with =sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory 1=, or use =--cache=file= for less performances, but less virtual memory pressure.\n*** I *still* get a \"Cannot allocate memory\" error\nYour FASTA file may contain too many fragments w.r.t. the number of mmap pages that can be mapped by a program. You may increase =max_map_count= with =sysctl -w vm.max_map_count 200000=, or use =--cache=file= for less performances, but less virtual memory pressure.\n*** I have another error\n[[https://github.com/delehef/fusta/issues][Open an issue stating your problem!]]\n* Contact\nIf you have any question or if you encounter a problem, do not hesitate to [[https://github.com/delehef/fusta/issues][open an issue]].\n* Acknowledgments\nFUSTA is standing on the shoulders of, among others, [[https://github.com/cberner/fuser][fuser]], [[https://github.com/clap-rs/clap][clap]], [[https://github.com/RazrFalcon/memmap2-rs][memmap2]] and [[https://github.com/knsd/daemonize][daemonize]].\n* Changelog\n** v1.7.1\n- Fix missing newline in some cases\n** v1.7\n- Use 1-based, fully-closed genomic coordinates\n** v1.6.1\n- Accept more characters as FASTA sequences: =\\n - _ . + ==\n** v1.6\n- Fix truncating\n- Improved error handling\n- Better notifications\n- Add a flag to allow overwrite of existing sequences as a side-effect\n- Only ASCII alphanumerical content can be written to sequence files\n- Refuse to open FASTA files with IDs containing characters invalid in a filename\n** v1.5.7\n- Update dependencies\n** v1.5.6\n- The default mount point is now =fusta-{filename}=\n** v1.5.4\n- Fix mountpoint not being created\n** v1.5.3\n- Improve notification system\n** v1.5.2\n- Daemonize by default\n** v1.5.1\n- Update memmap to memmap2\n** v1.5\n- Add an index on ino for better performances at the cost of a bit of memory\n** v1.4\n- Daemonize /after/ parsing FASTA files, so that (i) errors appear immediately and (ii) performances are better when launching multiple instances in parallel.\n** v1.3\n- Can now cache all fragments in memory: increased RAM consumption, but starkly reduced random access time\n** v1.2.1\n- Bugfixes\n** v1.2\n- FUSTA is now based on fuster instead of fuse-rs\n- Various optimization let FUSTA handle >40GB FASTA files in 6GB of RAM and much better performances\n- Added an optional notification system behind the =notifications= feature gate\n** v1.1.1\n- Use MMAP by default. While it may lead to unpleasant load when performing heavy operation on very large files, this should be a rather uncommon case.\n** v1.1\n- FUSTA can now directly extract ranges from a sequence\n** v1.0\n- Initial release\n \n"

If you wish to use FUSTA on compressed (multi)FASTA files, we recommend to use [[https://github.com/yhoogstrate/fastafs][FASTAFS]] as an intermediary to expose a compressed (multi)FASTA file to FUSTA without requiring to ully uncompress it.\n** Runtime options\n#+begin_src\nUSAGE:\n    fusta [OPTIONS] <FASTA> \n*** =--cache=\nThe cache option is key in adapting FUSTA to your use, and for files of non-trivial size, a correct choice is the difference between a memory overflow and a smooth run:\n- =file= :: in this mode, FUSTA store all the fragments as offsets in their file, and access them through =fseek= accesses. The performances will probably be the worse, but memory consumption will be kept to the minimal.\n- =mmap= :: this mode is extremely similar to the previous one, safe that access will proceed through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mmap][mmmap(2)]] reads, leveraging the caching facilities of the OS -- this is the default mode.\n- =memory= :: in this mode, all fragments will directly be copied to memory. Performances will be at their best, but enough memory should be available to store the entirety of the processed files.\n* Troubleshooting\n*** I get a \"Cannot allocate memory\" error\nThe FASTA files may be overflowing the default setting of the memory overcommit guard. You may change the overcommiting setting with =sysctl -w vm.overcommit_memory 1=, or use =--cache=file= for less performances, but less virtual memory pressure.\n*** I *still* get a \"Cannot allocate memory\" error\nYour FASTA file may contain too many fragments w.r.t. the number of mmap pages that can be mapped by a program. You may increase =max_map_count= with =sysctl -w vm.max_map_count 200000=, or use =--cache=file= for less performances, but less virtual memory pressure.\n*** I have another error\n[[https://github.com/delehef/fusta/issues][Open an issue stating your problem!]]\n* Contact\nIf you have any question or if you encounter a problem, do not hesitate to [[https://github.com/delehef/fusta/issues][open an issue]].\n* Acknowledgments\nFUSTA is standing on the shoulders of, among others, [[https://github.com/cberner/fuser][fuser]], [[https://github.com/clap-rs/clap][clap]], [[https://github.com/RazrFalcon/memmap2-rs][memmap2]] and [[https://github.com/knsd/daemonize][daemonize]].\n* Changelog\n** v1.7.1\n- Fix missing newline in some cases\n** v1.7\n- Use 1-based, fully-closed genomic coordinates\n** v1.6.1\n- Accept more characters as FASTA sequences: =\\n - _ . + ==\n** v1.6\n- Fix truncating\n- Improved error handling\n- Better notifications\n- Add a flag to allow overwrite of existing sequences as a side-effect\n- Only ASCII alphanumerical content can be written to sequence files\n- Refuse to open FASTA files with IDs containing characters invalid in a filename\n** v1.5.7\n- Update dependencies\n** v1.5.6\n- The default mount point is now =fusta-{filename}=\n** v1.5.4\n- Fix mountpoint not being created\n** v1.5.3\n- Improve notification system\n** v1.5.2\n- Daemonize by default\n** v1.5.1\n- Update memmap to memmap2\n** v1.5\n- Add an index on ino for better performances at the cost of a bit of memory\n** v1.4\n- Daemonize /after/ parsing FASTA files, so that (i) errors appear immediately and (ii) performances are better when launching multiple instances in parallel.\n** v1.3\n- Can now cache all fragments in memory: increased RAM consumption, but starkly reduced random access time\n** v1.2.1\n- Bugfixes\n** v1.2\n- FUSTA is now based on fuster instead of fuse-rs\n- Various optimization let FUSTA handle >40GB FASTA files in 6GB of RAM and much better performances\n- Added an optional notification system behind the =notifications= feature gate\n** v1.1.1\n- Use MMAP by default. While it may lead to unpleasant load when performing heavy operation on very large files, this should be a rather uncommon case.\n** v1.1\n- FUSTA can now directly extract ranges from a sequence\n** v1.0\n- Initial release\n \n"
