It is recommended that the weakest SNP interactions are removed before merging. This would reduce the overall data size by several orders of magnitude. \n"

The parameters associated with each step are configurable at the top of the sh file. For privacy concerns, we cannot disclose the full GWAS data. Therefore, some of the experimental procedures cannot be replicated due to the lack of data.
