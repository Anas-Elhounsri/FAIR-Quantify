In order to do so,\n> * Make sure that you have Xcode command line tools installed on your computer.\n> * Remove other gfortran installations if they exist. For this, you can launch a terminal window and type \"which gfortran\". If you see a path returned (e.g. /usr/local/bin/gfortran) you have a previous installation of gfortran that needs to be removed.\n> * Download new gfortran binaries for your operating system from here and decompress the folder (eg: gunzip gfortran-8.3-bin.tar.gz).\n> * Then run, sudo tar -xvf gfortran-8.3-bin.tar -C / which will install everything in /usr/local/bin/gfortran.\n2. `API rate limit exceeded`. This is because the dependent packages for `scSTEM` use `GitHub` API, which has been limited 60 requests by default. To increase the limit, you can execute the following code in R:`usethis::create_github_token()`. This will take you to your `GitHub` account page (you may register a new account if you haven't done so), where you can generate a new token. Once this new token has been created. You may run the following code in R: `usethis::edit_r_environ()`. This will take you to the R environment variable editor, where you can specify your token by `GITHUB_PAT = 'your_token'`. Replace `your_token` by the token you just created then close restart R and resume the installation steps.\n3. If you encounter error message related to Xcode, open terminal and type xcode-select --install and then follow the prompts. This is required by Monocle 3.\n4. If you don't see the package installation information after running `renv::restore(prompt = F)` but instead only see a message `* The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.` This is probably because your text editor (such as the default TextEdit in macOS) may automatically append file extension after `renv.lock` when you save the content by the text editor. This will cause `renv` to fail because `renv.lock` file cannot be found. Double-check the file name and its extension. Remove any extensions after `renv.lock` (e.g. `.rtf` or `RTF`). "

We would recommend installing Rstudio to interact with R in an easy-to-use GUI. If R asks \"Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation?\", it is recommended to select No (or N). Below are installation steps using `renv`:\n1.In R, execute the following code to install `renv`:\n```R\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\n```\n2. Create a new directory to store dependency files for scSTEM (e.g. `/home/alex/scstem`). `renv` will later install dependencies into this personal folder. Download the `renv.lock` file in this repository or right click and 'save as' from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexQiSong/scSTEM/master/renv.lock). `renv.lock` is the lock file which contains the dependency information. **Note that when you copy and paste the content of renv.lock into a text editor and save the file, your text editor (such as the default TextEdit in macOS) may automatically append file extension after renv.lock. This will cause `renv` to fail because `renv.lock` file cannot be found. Double-check the file name and its extension. Remove any extensions after `renv.lock` (e.g. `.rtf` or `RTF`).** \n3. Once lock file is downloaded, copy the file into the folder you just created. Make sure the file name is 'renv.lock'. Then in R, execute the following code to activate the environment in this personal folder.\n```R\ninstall_folder = \"/home/alex/scstem/\"\nrenv::activate(install_folder)\n# \"/home/alex/scstem/\" is the path to the directory we just created (The direcotry where the renv.lock file should be saved.)\n# You will need to replace them with your own directory and path.\n```\n4. Once the environment is activated. Install all necessary files into this personal folder simply by using the following code.\n```\nrenv::restore(prompt = F)\n```\n5. **How to run and exit scSTEM.**\nTo activate the project environment and run scSTEM, simply executing the following code. R will then load all dependencies from the folder we just created.\n```R\nrenv::activate(install_folder)\nlibrary(\"scSTEM\")\nrun_scstem_GUI()\n```\nWhere `install_folder` is the project folder we just created to install scSTEM.\nAfter analysis is done, you may deactivate the project environment for `scSTEM`, simiply by executing the following code:\n```R\nrenv::deactivate()\n```\n6. **How to uninstall scSTEM**\nThanks to `renv`, uninstalling scSTEM is quite easy. The only thing you need to do is just removing the folder (in this tutorial, \"/home/alex/scstem/\"). This would not impact other packages you installed for R."

If windows users are seeing \"Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed\" during installation, you may instal Rtools from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/\n```R\n# Install devtools\ninstall.packages('devtools')\n\n# Install Bioconductor (for R >= 4.1.0)\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n  install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(version = \"3.13\", ask = FALSE)\n\n# Install Bioconductor dependencies\nBiocManager::install(c('BiocGenerics', 'DelayedArray', 'DelayedMatrixStats',\n                       'limma', 'S4Vectors', 'SingleCellExperiment',\n                       'SummarizedExperiment', 'batchelor', 'Matrix.utils'), ask = FALSE)\n\n# Now, install monocle3 through the cole-trapnell-lab GitHub, execute:\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github('cole-trapnell-lab/leidenbase', upgrade = \"always\")\ndevtools::install_github('cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3', upgrade = \"always\")\n\n# Install biomaRt\nBiocManager::install(\"biomaRt\", ask = FALSE)\n\n# Install ROGUE\ndevtools::install_github(\"PaulingLiu/ROGUE\", upgrade = \"always\")\n\n# Install Dynverse\ndevtools::install_github(\"dynverse/dyno\", upgrade = \"always\")\n\n# Install scSTEM\ndevtools::install_github(\"alexQiSong/scSTEM\", upgrade = \"always\")\n```"

In order to do so,\n> * Make sure that you have Xcode command line tools installed on your computer.\n> * Remove other gfortran installations if they exist. For this, you can launch a terminal window and type \"which gfortran\". If you see a path returned (e.g. /usr/local/bin/gfortran) you have a previous installation of gfortran that needs to be removed.\n> * Download new gfortran binaries for your operating system from here and decompress the folder (eg: gunzip gfortran-8.3-bin.tar.gz).\n> * Then run, sudo tar -xvf gfortran-8.3-bin.tar -C / which will install everything in /usr/local/bin/gfortran.\n2. `API rate limit exceeded`. This is because the dependent packages for `scSTEM` use `GitHub` API, which has been limited 60 requests by default. To increase the limit, you can execute the following code in R:`usethis::create_github_token()`. This will take you to your `GitHub` account page (you may register a new account if you haven't done so), where you can generate a new token. Once this new token has been created. You may run the following code in R: `usethis::edit_r_environ()`. This will take you to the R environment variable editor, where you can specify your token by `GITHUB_PAT = 'your_token'`. Replace `your_token` by the token you just created then close restart R and resume the installation steps.\n3. If you encounter error message related to Xcode, open terminal and type xcode-select --install and then follow the prompts. This is required by Monocle 3.\n4. If you don't see the package installation information after running `renv::restore(prompt = F)` but instead only see a message `* The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.` This is probably because your text editor (such as the default TextEdit in macOS) may automatically append file extension after `renv.lock` when you save the content by the text editor. This will cause `renv` to fail because `renv.lock` file cannot be found. Double-check the file name and its extension. Remove any extensions after `renv.lock` (e.g. `.rtf` or `RTF`). "

Make sure that you have 1) **R version >= 4.1.0, [download R here](https://cran.r-project.org/)**, 2) **Java, [download Java here](https://java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)** installed and 3) **internet access**. We would recommend installing Rstudio to interact with R in an easy-to-use GUI. If R asks \"Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation?\", it is recommended to select No (or N). Below are installation steps using `renv`:\n1.In R, execute the following code to install `renv`:\n```R\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\n```\n2. Create a new directory to store dependency files for scSTEM (e.g. `/home/alex/scstem`). `renv` will later install dependencies into this personal folder. Download the `renv.lock` file in this repository or right click and 'save as' from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexQiSong/scSTEM/master/renv.lock). `renv.lock` is the lock file which contains the dependency information. **Note that when you copy and paste the content of renv.lock into a text editor and save the file, your text editor (such as the default TextEdit in macOS) may automatically append file extension after renv.lock. This will cause `renv` to fail because `renv.lock` file cannot be found. Double-check the file name and its extension. Remove any extensions after `renv.lock` (e.g. `.rtf` or `RTF`).** \n3. Once lock file is downloaded, copy the file into the folder you just created. Make sure the file name is 'renv.lock'. Then in R, execute the following code to activate the environment in this personal folder.\n```R\ninstall_folder = \"/home/alex/scstem/\"\nrenv::activate(install_folder)\n# \"/home/alex/scstem/\" is the path to the directory we just created (The direcotry where the renv.lock file should be saved.)\n# You will need to replace them with your own directory and path.\n```\n4. Once the environment is activated. Install all necessary files into this personal folder simply by using the following code.\n```\nrenv::restore(prompt = F)\n```\n5. **How to run and exit scSTEM.**\nTo activate the project environment and run scSTEM, simply executing the following code. R will then load all dependencies from the folder we just created.\n```R\nrenv::activate(install_folder)\nlibrary(\"scSTEM\")\nrun_scstem_GUI()\n```\nWhere `install_folder` is the project folder we just created to install scSTEM.\nAfter analysis is done, you may deactivate the project environment for `scSTEM`, simiply by executing the following code:\n```R\nrenv::deactivate()\n```\n6. **How to uninstall scSTEM**\nThanks to `renv`, uninstalling scSTEM is quite easy. The only thing you need to do is just removing the folder (in this tutorial, \"/home/alex/scstem/\"). This would not impact other packages you installed for R."

        "value": "scSTEM analysis involves running dimensionality reduction, cell clustering, trajectory inference, and gene clustering. While the functionality of dimensionality reduction and cell clustering is provided here to facilitate users to choose cells of interest, they are optional for the following steps. The steps of running analysis with GUI is described below. We will use the sample data set at https://github.com/alexQiSong/scSTEM_sample_data as an example showing the analysis functionality. This data set contains human fetal immune blood cells and was published with [Cao et al., 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7721). **Note that internet connection is required as scSTEM may convert gene IDs using biomaRt which converts the gene IDs using ensembl database.**\n\nTo launch the scSTEM GUI, execute the following code in R:\n\n```R\nlibrary(scSTEM)\nrun_scstem_GUI()\n```\n\n1. **Step 1:  Load input files.** Click each of the three buttons on the top of the GUI to select corresponding input files. Click `Load files` to load all selected files. If files were successfully loaded, there will be a line of text showing `All files successfully loaded` in the top panel. Once the sample data set is downloaded, select the path for each input file and select the gene ID type and species. For ID type, gene symbol and ensmebl ID are supported and for species, human and mouse are supported.\n \n![Alt text](img/step1.png?raw=true \"Load input files\")  \n\nAlternatively, you may load sample data set by clicking the \"Load sample data\" button. It automatically loads the sample data set for this tutorial. This is the data set from a publised research[Cao et el., 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7721).\n\n2. **Step 2: Visualizing and clustering cells.** In the second panel, scSTEM can perform dimensionality reduction and cell clustering. This step can be optional for some trajectory inference methods but is required if `monocle3` is selected as trajectory inference method. This step also provides 2D UMAP visualization that assists users to  select cells of interest. If this step is skipped, scSTEM will take all cells from the input expression count matrix. To visualize dimensionality reduction results, first  click  `Run  UMAP`. Then there is an argument `PCA dim` (default value 100) that may be provided by users before running UMAP. `PCA dim` specifies the number of dimensions for principle component analysis, which is a preprocessing step to denoise and decorrelate input dimensions before running UMAP. \n\n![Alt text](img/step2_pca_options.png)\n\nAfter UMAP  is  done,  click `Run Clustering` and then `Visualize Results`. For the sample data set, we can see the cell partition number is displayed along with the cells. Let's focus on partition 4 highlited by green color here. For the sample data set, partitions may bi numbered differently on different OS. You may find the partition shown in the figure below numbered by a different number. \n\n![Alt text](img/step2.png?raw=true \"umap1\")\n\nFurther, `scSTEM` also allows for coloring the cell clusters using different column information from the `cell_meta_data` file other than the cell partition numbers from clustering. This would allow you to view the cells by cell type or experimental batches or other meta data information. But make sure the number of unique labels to visualize is not too many otherwise the application may crash. In this tutorial, we visualize the cell cluster by selecting `Blood_cell_name` from the `column_to_visualize` dropdown list.  \n\n![Alt text](img/step2_vis_col1.png?raw=true \"step2_vis_col1\")\n\nNow you will see that instead of showing cell partition number (default option), the UMAP plot is colored and labeled by blood cell type name.\n\n![Alt text](img/step2_vis_col2.png?raw=true \"step2_vis_col2\")\n\n3. **Step 3: Infer trajectories.** In the third panel, scSTEM can perform trajectory inference. To infer trajectories for the input data, simply select cell partitions of interest from the `partition` drop-down list (generated from the second step) and then select trajectory inference method from the `Method` drop-down list. Once partition and `Method` were selected, users can click `infer trajectory` to infer trajectories. For this sample data set, let's select partition 4 and `monocle3` from the `Method` list to infer trajectoryies. The `use partition` option is only valid for `monocle3` as inference method. Once selected, monocle3 will infer disjoint trajectory graph separately for each cell partition.  \n\n![Alt text](img/step3.png?raw=true \"step3\")\n\nNote that for monocle3, you may prune the trajectory to avoid having too may small branches. You could do this by tunning the parameter in the `Infer trajectory` dropdown list, where you can enter a value of minimal branch length (Larger value will result in less small branches, default value = 10, only effective when `Monocle3` is the inference method). After this is done, you may click `infer` button to infer the trajectory.\n\n![Alt text](img/step3_prune.png?raw=true \"step3_prune\")\n\n4. **Step 4: Check paths.** In the fourth panel, users may 1) **visualize** the paths inferred by the previous step and 2) **check linear fit** for each path. For visualization, the selected path is highlighted by red color and cells mapped to the path is marked by yellow color. Let's select `path1` to visualize. Selected path will be shown on the right part of the GUI.  \n\n![Alt text](img/UMAP2.png?raw=true \"umap2\")  \n\nIn addition, we may also be interested in testing whether the change of expression is linear for each gene along the trajectory path. scSTEM can do a quick check by fitting linear models using expression of each gene to predict cell pseudtime on each segment of a selected path in **Step 4** panel. Users may do this by clicking on the `check linear` button in the **Step 4** panel. After fitting is completed, a plot will appear in a pop-up window showing the percentage of genes which has significant \"good fit\" from F test. As shown below, `Terminal segment` represents the segment located at the end of a trajecotry path and otherwise not. \n\n![Alt text](img/linear.png?raw=true \"linear\")\n\n5. **Step 5: Run STEM analysis.** In the fifth panel, users can perform scSTEM analysis. Currently there are two parameters `metric` and `path` to be specified for scSTEM. `metric` specifies the method to summarize expression data from trajectories. Users can select `mean`, `entropy_reduction`, or `change_rate` from the `metric` drop-down list. In the `select a path` drop-down list, users can specify a path of interest to run scSTEM clustering (which can be visualized in **step 4**). Users will need to provide an output folder where output files and temporary files can be saved. Click the `output folder` button to specify an output folder. In this sample data set, let's select `path2` and `path3` in the `select a path` drop-down list, and `mean` in the `metric` drop-down list to run the STEM analysis.\n![Alt text](img/step5.png?raw=true \"umap2\")  \n scSTEM will iterate through the selected paths and generate clusters for each of the path. This is done by calling the STEM java program. The STEM java GUI will show the profile plots after clustering is finished. In the screenshot shown below, **profiles with the same color together represent a gene cluster.**\n![Alt text](img/stem_plot1.png?raw=true \"stem_plot1\")  \nUsers may further click the profile to have a detailed view of gene expression pattern in the pop-up window, in which users may also view and save the cluster gene and GO annotations by clicking `Cluster Gene Table` and `Cluster GO Table`, respectively.\n\n![Alt text](img/stem_plot2.png?raw=true \"stem_plot2\")   \n\n6. **Step 6: Run comparative analysis.** In the sixth panel, users can perform comparison of gene clustering results from different trajectory paths. To do this, first select the two paths to be compared in the two drop-down lists `Path name 1` and `Path name 2`, then click the `Run comparison` button. scSTEM will call STEM java program to run gene clustering and comparison of clustering results for the selected paths. For this sample data set, let's select `path2` and `path3` from the drop-down lists to compare. After clustering is done, STEM java program will show a cluster comparison plot with each row representing the matched clusters from the two paths.  \n\n![Alt text](img/comparison.png?raw=true \"comparison\")  \n\nTo zoom-in the plot, you may hold and drag the right mouse. To move the plot in the window, you may hold and drag the left mouse.\n"
