        "value": "Snekmer is a software package designed to reduce the representation of protein sequences\nby combining amino acid reduction (AAR) with the kmer approach. Based on the AAR-kmer representations,\nSnekmer subsequently (1) clusters sequences using various unsupervised clustering algorithms,\n(2) generates supervised machine learning models, or (3) searches sequences against pre-trained models\nto determine probabilistic annotations. \nThere are six operation modes for Snekmer: `cluster`, `model`, and `search`, `learn`, `apply`, and `motif`. \n**Cluster mode:** The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. FASTA).\nSnekmer applies the relevant workflow steps and outputs the resulting clustering results in tabular form (.CSV),\nas well as the cluster object itself (.cluster). Figures are also generated (e.g. t-SNE, UMAP) to help the user\ncontextualize their results. \n**Model mode:** The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. FASTA).\nSnekmer applies the relevant workflow steps and outputs the resulting models as objects (.model). Snekmer also\ndisplays K-fold cross validation results in the form of figures (AUC ROC and PR AUC curves) and a table (.CSV). \n**Search mode:** The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. FASTA)\nand the models they wish to search their sequences against. Snekmer applies the relevant workflow steps\nand outputs a table for each file containing model annotation probabilities for the given sequences. \n**Learn mode:** The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. FASTA)\nas well as an annotation file. Snekmer generates a kmer counts matrix with the summed kmer distribution\nof each annotation recognized from the sequence ID. Snekmer then performs a self-evaluation to assess\nconfidence levels. There are two outputs, a counts matrix, and a global confidence distribution. \n**Apply mode:** The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. FASTA)\nand the outputs received from Learn. Snekmer uses cosine distance to predict the annotation of each\nsequence from the kmer counts matrix. The output is a table for each file containing sequence annotation\npredictions with confidence levels. \n**Motif mode:** The user supplies files containing sequences in an appropriate format (e.g. FASTA)\nand the outputs received from Model. Snekmer performs a feature selection workflow to produce a \nlist of motifs ordered by degree of conservation and a classification model using the selected features (.model).\n \n"

        "description": "# Snekmer v1.0.3 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThe Snekmer v1.0.3 release includes code refactoring and some changes to improve usability, including improving documentation and logged error messages, updating CI to directly install and execute Snekmer for better error catching, and restricting some CLI arguments to minimize errors.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n## Major Changes\r\n\r\n* Certain snakemake args (`--configfile`, `--cores`) no longer produce errors under default conditions.\r\n* Documentation updates now include instructions for the Snekmer Docker container.\r\n* Snekmer prevents automated model-building for files containing an insufficient number of sequences.\r\n* GitHub actions (CLI) workflow now captures the full installation and code execution process instead of indirect testing via calling individual Snakefiles.\r\n* Where appropriate, `run` directive has been replaced with `script` directive to reduce Snakefile size and make formatting/linting/debugging easier.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n\r\n* Documentation has been updated, particularly for troubleshooting.\r\n* Nested output directory option is now working again.\r\n* Minor docstring/type hinting updates\r\n\r\n# Contributors\r\n\r\n* Christine Chang (@christinehc)\r\n* Jason McDermott (@biodataganache)\r\n* Jeremy Jacobson (@jjacobson95)",
