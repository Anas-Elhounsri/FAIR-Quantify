By contrast, the\nGNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if\nyou wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,\nthat you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free\nprograms, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these\nrights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that\nyou received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code. And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)\nassert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving\nyou legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers\\' and authors\\' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users\\' and\nauthors\\' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting\nusers\\' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such\nabuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is\nprecisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed\nthis version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If\nsuch problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to\nextend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as\nneeded to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**\n\n**0. Definitions.**\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\nthe Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature\nthat (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the\nuser that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that\nwarranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this\nLicense, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface\npresents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent\nitem in the list meets this criterion.\n\n**1. Source Code.**\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a\nwork.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is\nwidely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major\nComponent, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major\nComponent\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,\nwindow system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on\nwhich the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,\nor an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the\nsource code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)\nrun the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control\nthose activities. However, it does not include the work\\'s System\nLibraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs\nwhich are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are\nnot part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes\ninterface definition files associated with source files for the work,\nand the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked\nsubprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as\nby intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms\nand other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n**2. Basic Permissions.**\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n**3. Protecting Users\\' Legal Rights from Anti-Circumvention Law.**\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11\nof the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar\nlaws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the\ncovered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\\'s\nusers, your or third parties\\' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n**4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.**\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program\\'s source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep\nintact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive\nterms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all\nnotices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy\nof this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and\nyou may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n**5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.**\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms\nof section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n-   a\\) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you\n    modified it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n-   b\\) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under\n    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4\n    to \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n-   c\\) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License\n    to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will\n    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional\n    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of\n    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license\n    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such\n    permission if you have separately received it.\n\n-   d\\) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and\nwhich are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or\non a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used\nto limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\\'s users beyond\nwhat the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an\naggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the\naggregate.\n\n**6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.**\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n-   a\\) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n-   b\\) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\n    Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n-   c\\) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n-   d\\) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n-   e\\) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included\nin conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favour of\ncoverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,\n\"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to\nuse, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether\nthe product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses,\nunless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the\nproduct.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product\nfrom a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information\nmust suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified\nobject code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by\nthe Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if\nneither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified\nobject code on the User Product (for example, the work has been\ninstalled in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in\naccord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented\n(and with an implementation available to the public in source code\nform), and must require no special password or key for unpacking,\nreading or copying.\n\n**7. Additional Terms.**\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this\nLicense without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove\nany additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.\n(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in\ncertain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional\npermissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you\nhave or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n-   a\\) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n-   b\\) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n-   c\\) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n-   d\\) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n-   e\\) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n-   f\\) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\n    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\n    impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a\nfurther restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of\nthat license document, provided that the further restriction does not\nsurvive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must\nplace, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms\nthat apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the\napplicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above\nrequirements apply either way.\n\n**8. Termination.**\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates\nyour license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to\nnotify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days\nafter the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated\npermanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by\nsome reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice\nof violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,\nand you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the\nnotice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n**9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.**\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a\ncopy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring\nsolely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a\ncopy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than\nthis License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered\nwork. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this\nLicense. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you\nindicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n**10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.**\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work\nresults from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who\nreceives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work\nthe party\\'s predecessor in interest had or could give under the\nprevious paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding\nSource of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\nhas it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not\nimpose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights\ngranted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any\npatent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale,\nor importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n**11. Patents.**\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work\nthus licensed is called the contributor\\'s \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor\\'s \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter\nacquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this\nLicense, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do\nnot include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of\nfurther modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this\ndefinition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in\na manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor\\'s essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and\nthe Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to\ncopy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient\\'s use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or\nconvey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you\ngrant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work\nand works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are\na party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of\ndistributing software, under which you make payment to the third party\nbased on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under\nwhich the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive\nthe covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in\nconnection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies\nmade from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with\nspecific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless\nyou entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,\nprior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any\nimplied license or other defences to infringement that may otherwise be\navailable to you under applicable patent law.\n\n**12. No Surrender of Others\\' Freedom.**\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that\nobligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to\nwhom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those\nterms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the\nProgram.\n\n**13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.**\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission\nto link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3\nof the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work,\nand to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will\ncontinue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special\nrequirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,\nconcerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination\nas such.\n\n**14. Revised Versions of this License.**\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of\nany later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy\\'s public\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\nchoose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions.\nHowever, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or\ncopyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n**15. Disclaimer of Warranty.**\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\nTHE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n**16. Limitation of Liability.**\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES\nSUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\nWITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n**17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.**\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above\ncannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing\ncourts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute\nwaiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a\nwarranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in\nreturn for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"
