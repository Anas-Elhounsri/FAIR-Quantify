Each of these steps can be run individually as well as together as show belwo:\n\n1. **Chemical enrichment**\nThe following command links chemicals to genes of interest based on causality. In this command it is necessary to indicate whether the file contains uniprot ids or not with the `--uniprot` or `--no-uniprot` parameter.\n\n```shell\n$ pemt run-chemical-extractor --name=<ANALYSIS NAME> --data=<DATA FILE PATH> --input-type=<DATA FILE SEPARATOR> --uniprot\n\n```\n\n2. **Patent enrichment**\nThe following command interlinks chemicals to patent literature publicly available.\n\n```shell\n$ pemt run-patent-extractor --name=<ANALYSIS NAME> --chromedriver-path=<PATH TO CHROMEDRIVER> --os=<OS NAME> --no-chemical\n```\n\nWe also allow the flexibility to start the pipeline from this step, if the user has list of chemicals in the right format as indicated above. The user then has to use the tag `--chemical` and provide a respective `--chemical-data` path.\n\n3. **PEMT workflow**\nThe following command generates the patent enrichment on the gene data where the gene data file is a TSV file containing uniprot identifiers.\n\n```shell\n$ pemt run-pemt --name=<ANALYSIS NAME> --data=<DATA FILE PATH> --input-type=<DATA FILE SEPARATOR> --chromedriver-path=<PATH TO CHROMEDRIVER> --os=<OS NAME>\n```\n"
