This method is robust and fast, so normally you don't have to input the adapter sequence even you know it. But you can still specify the adapter sequences for read1 by `--adapter_sequence`, and for read2 by `--adapter_sequence_r2`. If `fastp` fails to find an overlap (i.e. due to low quality bases), it will use these sequences to trim adapters for read1 and read2 respectively.\n* For PE data, the adapter sequence auto-detection is disabled by default since the adapters can be trimmed by overlap analysis. However, you can specify `--detect_adapter_for_pe` to enable it.\n* For PE data, `fastp` will run a little slower if you specify the sequence adapters or enable adapter auto-detection, but usually result in a slightly cleaner output, since the overlap analysis may fail due to sequencing errors or adapter dimers.\n* The most widely used adapter is the Illumina TruSeq adapters.

If you want to make some adapters to be a part of the built-in adapters, please file an issue. \nYou can also specify `--adapter_fasta` to give a FASTA file to tell `fastp` to trim multiple adapters in this FASTA file.

The merged reads are also filtered.\n* `--out1` and `--out2` will be the reads that cannot be merged successfully, but both pass all the filters.\n* `--unpaired1` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read1` passes filters but `read2` doesn't.\n* `--unpaired2` will be the reads that cannot be merged, `read2` passes filters but `read1` doesn't.\n* `--include_unmerged` can be enabled to make reads of `--out1`, `--out2`, `--unpaired1` and `--unpaired2` redirected to `--merged_out`. So you will get a single output file. This option is disabled by default. \n`--failed_out` can still be given to store the reads (either merged or unmerged) failed to passing filters. \nIn the output file, a tag like `merged_xxx_yyy`will be added to each read name to indicate that how many base pairs are from read1 and from read2, respectively. For example, `\n@NB551106:9:H5Y5GBGX2:1:22306:18653:13119 1:N:0:GATCAG merged_150_15`\nmeans that 150bp are from read1, and 15bp are from read2. `fastp` prefers the bases in read1 since they usually have higher quality than read2. \nSame as the [base correction feature](#base-correction-for-pe-data), this function is also based on overlapping detection, which has adjustable parameters `overlap_len_require (default 30)`, `overlap_diff_limit (default 5)` and `overlap_diff_percent_limit (default 20%)`.

This feature is enabled for NextSeq/NovaSeq data by default, and you can specify -g or --trim_poly_g to enable it for any data, or specify -G or --disable_trim_poly_g to disable it. NextSeq/NovaSeq data is detected by the machine ID in the FASTQ records.",
