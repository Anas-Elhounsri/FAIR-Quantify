You can then use the `path` from this response to fetch the actual file by making a request to `/tools/{id}/versions/{version_id}/{type}/descriptor/{relative_path}`.\n\nHowever, due to the features of Yevis, which include pre-generating the API responses and deploying them on GitHub Pages, it isn't capable of retrieving the actual file. Therefore, Yevis adjusts the `path` in the `/tools/{id}/versions/{version_id}/{type}/files` response to point directly to the actual file URL, as shown below:\n\n```json\n$ curl -fsSL https://ddbj.github.io/workflow-registry/tools/20da6ea5-de91-4973-ac20-216882357a0d/versions/1.0.0/NFL/files | jq .[0]\n{\n  \"path\": \"https://zenodo.org/api/files/bb3e4bea-a1e5-49c8-8479-960299972c43/LICENSE\",\n  \"file_type\": \"SECONDARY_DESCRIPTOR\",\n  \"checksum\": {\n    \"checksum\": \"5b70dc64d1f1bd721b6d62f587aa8d1f228d8ec128df58d32ae51cbac1347610\",\n    \"type\": \"sha256\"\n  }\n}\n```\n"
