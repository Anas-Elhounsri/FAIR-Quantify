It has been conceived as an add-on that expands the PhysiCell ([doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991)) agent-based functionalities with intracellular cell signalling using MaBoSS having a decoupled, maintainable and model-agnostic design. PhysiBoSS 2.0 reproduces simulations reported in the original PhysiBoSS publications and can be used with other Boolean models, for instance to predict drug synergy in a gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. \nA tutorial, explaining the new functionalities of PhysiBoSS, including the automated input/output mapping, and more, is available as a preprint.
