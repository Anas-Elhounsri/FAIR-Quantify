Each step begins with a scaffold pool (initially, this pool is the set of input scaffolds themselves). The scaffolding algorithm is used to order and orient these scaffolds. Next, the misjoin correction algorithm is applied to detect errors in the scaffold pool, thus creating an edited scaffold pool. Finally, the edited scaffold pool is used as an input for the next iteration of the misjoin correction algorithm. The ultimate effect of these iterations is to reliably detect misjoins in the input scaffolds without removing correctly assembled sequence. After this process is complete, the scaffolding algorithm is applied to the revised input scaffolds, and the output \u2013 a single \u201cmegascaffold\u201d which concatenates all the chromosomes \u2013 is retained for post-processing. \nThis post-processing includes four steps: (i) a polishing algorithm which attempts to fix errors when cumulative 3D signal 'wins' over the diagonal; (ii) a chromosome splitting algorithm, which is used to extract the chromosome-length scaffolds from the megascaffold; (iii) a sealing algorithm, which detects false positives in the misjoin correction process, and restores the erroneously removed sequence from the original scaffold; and (iv) a merge algorithm, which corrects misassembly errors due to undercollapsed heterozygosity in the input scaffolds. Step (iv) are omitted for Hs2-HiC, which is not in the Rabl configuration and lacks substantial undercollapsed heterozygosity.\n \n"
