During the index build, the sequences in the chunked FASTA file are concatenated while recording the location of sequence boundaries and the TaxID associated with each sequence. A suffix array, Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), and FM-index are built from the concatenated sequences using the Rust-Bio v0.39.1 package. The FM-index and the associated sequence metadata constitutes the MG-index. One MG-index is created per FASTA file, and new indices can be added as the reference collection grows without needing to rebuild any of the existing indices.\n```\n$ mtsv-build --fasta /path/to/chunkN.fasta --index /path/to/write/chunkN.index\n```\n \nUsing default settings, indices will be ~3.6x the size of the reference file and require about that much RAM to run the binning step. The default sampling interval is 64 for the BWT occurance array and 32 for the suffix array. This can be overridden by passing `--sample-interval <FM_SAMPLE_INTERVAL>` for the occurance array or `--sa-sample <SA_SAMPLE_RATE>` for the suffix array. Lower values will increase the size of the index and can provide a reduction in query time. Increasing the flag will decrease the size of the index up to a point while accepting a slower query time. \n"

It will begin by extracting overlapping substrings (seeds) of the same size (`--seed-size`) with certain offsets (`--seed-interval`) from each query sequence and its reverse complement. It then uses the MG-index to search for exact, ungapped matches for each seed. The seed matches are sorted by location and grouped into candidate regions using specified windows. The number of hits per candidate is tallied and any candidate that does not meet the minimum number of seed hits is filtered out. The remaining candidate positions are sorted in descending order by the number of seed hits so that the most promising regions are evaluated first.  \nFor each candidate region, MTSv extracts the corresponding range from the reference sequence and looks up the TaxID associated with the region in the MG-index. If the current query has already been sucessfully aligned to the TaxID associated with the candidate region, no additional alignment is attempted, and the next candidate region is checked. Otherwise an SIMD-accelerated Smith-Waterman alignment is performed between the extracted reference sequence and the query sequence (using a scoring of 1 for matches and -1 for mismatches, gap opening, and gap extension). If the alignment score is sufficiently high, there is one final check to determine if the edit distance is less than or equal to the user-specified edit distance cutoff (`--edit-rate`). If the alignment is considered successful, then no further alignments are attempted for that query against the same TaxID. Skipping all additional alignments to a TaxID avoids many expensive operations and reduces computation time. \n"

        "description": "# Version 2.0.2\r\nIntroduces the `--tune-max-hits` parameter. Having too many seed hits can cause inefficient runtimes by increasing the number of reverse lookups and position searches. While the `--max-hits` parameter just skips seeds that have a very high number of hits, the `--tune-max-hits` parameter doubles the seed interval to reduce the total number of seed lookups per read. This may reduce sensitivity for some reads with many seed hits but it does not have a large impact.\r\n\r\nDefault parameters have been adjusted to better balance speed and accuracy. \r\n",
