        "value": "This repository contains the implementation of MASTRO, our algorithm to discover statistically significant conserved evolutionary trajectories of alterations from phylogenetic tumor trees. All details on MASTRO are in the paper, published in Bioinformatics https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac467  \nPlease address questions and bug reports to Leonardo Pellegrina (leonardo.pellegrina@unipd.it) and Fabio Vandin (fabio.vandin@unipd.it). \nOur implementation of MASTRO leverages LCM (version 5.3 by Takeaki Uno http://research.nii.ac.jp/~uno/codes.htm ) to mine frequent itemsets.\nThe folder `/MASTRO/` contains the source files for the implementation of MASTRO and for reproducing the experiments described in the paper. The folder `/data/` contains the data analyzed by MASTRO (and scripts to preprocess it). \nTo run MASTRO use the python script `run_MASTRO.py`. Such script accepts various parameters, listed and described by using the `-h` flag:\n```\nusage: run_MASTRO.py [-h] [-g G] [-p P] [-s S] [-minp MINP]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  -g G        input file with graphs\n  -p P        permutation type: 0 = indipendent, 1 = permutation, 2 = ind. in random topology (def=0)\n  -s S        minimum support of trajectories (def=2)\n  -minp MINP  path to append minimum pvalue (optional)\n```\n \nThe parameter `-s` sets the minimum support of the trajectories to find (the minimum number of tumor trees in which any trajectory must be observed to be frequent). \nThe flag `-p` specifies the type of statistical test to use for evaluating the significance of a frequent trajectory:\n`0` is the statistical test in which alterations are assumed to be inserted uniformly and independently at random on the nodes, preserving the set of alterations of each patient and the topology of the tumor trees.\n`1` is the statistical test assuming that alterations are randomly permuted (preserving the number of alterations in each node).\n`2` is the statistical test that consider uniform and independent assignment of each alteration on a tree with random topology (that is sampled uniformly from the set of topologies of the cohort). \nTo correct for multiple hypothesis testing, MASTRO uses resampling-based procedures: the Westfall-Young permutation testing procedure to bound the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) and the Storey-Tibshirani method to estimate the False Discovery Rate (FDR).\nThe script `run_wy_correction.py` can be used to generate resampled datasets and running MASTRO on them.\nThe script `plot_results.py` generates various figures with the results, and also computes the corrected significance thresholds for bounding the FWER.\nThe script `plot_emp_FDR.py` estimates the FDR from the resampled datasets of the top-k results for various values of k.\n \n"
