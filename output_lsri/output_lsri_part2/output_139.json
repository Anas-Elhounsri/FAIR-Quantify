In order to identify candidate genes, gene family expansion events - as an important driver of adaptation - are integrated with differential gene expression to link genes to functions. \nThis workflow combines RNA-seq analyses (differential gene expression) with evolutionary analyses -> gene family expansion events.\nWe use Orthofinder2 to infer gene duplication events and integrate these with significant physiological reaction patterns in the compared species. \nThe newest releases of the workflow and WebApp now allow for final results without the need for transcriptomic data for *all* species during the workflow steps.  \nNevertheless, if possible the workflow should be run with input RNA-Seq reads (both PE/SE possible) suitable for a differential expression experiments (control vs. treatment), either a genomic or transcriptomic fasta file + annotation (.gtf) as well as a peptide fasta per species.  \nThis way, valuable phylogenetic information from species without available expression information for the conditions under investigation can be included.  \nFunctional information per species can be provided by the user or can be optionally inferred by our tool [AHRD](https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD) during the workflow.   \nYou can use the the A2TEA_finished.RData output in your own R terminal/Rstudio or use our **[A2TEA.WebApp](https://github.com/tgstoecker/A2TEA.WebApp)** which was specifically designed to allow for interactive inspection, visualization, filtering & export of the results and subsets. We feature a tutorial for its usage and details on how to work with the results of a A2TEA.Workflow analysis run. \n"

        "value": "By using the latest version of our docker container image via the combination of the commands `--use-conda --use-singularity` we can circumvent most potential issues that can arise when using option 1.  \nFrom the Snakemake docs:  \n*\"Snakemake will first pull the defined container image, and then create the requested conda environment from within the container. The conda environments will still be stored in your working environment, such that they don\u2019t have to be recreated unless they have changed. The hash under which the environments are stored includes the used container image url, such that changes to the container image also lead to new environments to be created. When a job is executed, Snakemake will first enter the container and then activate the conda environment.\"*  \nThis is perfectly stable in most cases but slower.  \nIf during the checkpoint steps many hypotheses are analyzed and the user chose many additional closest orthologous groups be added for multiple sequence alignment, tree building, etc. it can be a good idea to stop the run (CTRL + C) and continue without the `--use-singularity` option.  This is due to the workflow re-evaluating the DAG at this point and scheduling a huge amount of novel jobs (several ten- to hundreds of thousands), for each of which the container environment will be entered and the appropiate environment loaded seperately.  \nNote that you need to have singularity installed - e.g. `mamba  install -c conda-forge singularity`.  \n  \nSince on some systems or shared clusters the standard /tmp directory is quite small it can be necessary to change this to another directory.  \nA easy solution is to reate a tmp directory inside the workflow directory and set the tmpdir singularity env variable to this.  \n```\nmkdir /scratch2/cropbio/stoecker/A2TEA-pipeline/master_dev/a2tea/tmp/\nexport SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/scratch2/cropbio/stoecker/A2TEA-pipeline/master_dev/a2tea/tmp/\n```\n  \nSnakemake scripts sometimes can't find input files when using singularity - this is probably because the correct directories haven't been bind-mounted when singularity was run.  \nAdding this to the snakemake command usually helps:  \n```\n--singularity-args '-B /scratch2/cropbio/stoecker/A2TEA-pipeline/master_dev/a2tea'\n#remember however that if you bind mount directories you have to make sure all input files can be found\n#linking files from a mounted connection somewhere else on the file system\n#therefore just copy every input file into the A2TEA.Workflow directory to be on the safe side\n```\n  "

e.g. \"Expanded in Arabidopsis compared to Monocots\"\n- expanded_in - (string) one or multiple species (seperated by \";\") which are checked for gene family expansion events compared to one or multiple species (seperated by \";\") under compared_to\n- compared_to - (string) see above\n- Nmin_expanded_in - (integer) minimum number of expanded_in species that need to fulfill expansion criteria for the gene family to be called expanded\n- Nmin_compared_to - (integer) minimum number of compared_to species that need to fulfill expansion criteria (but in the opposite way aka contraction) for the gene family to be called expanded\n- min_expansion_factor - (integer) minimum factor of expansion between expanded_in and compared_to species (!NOTE: set to unrealistically high integer - e.g. 100 - to use only \"min_expansion_difference\" criterium)\n- min_expansion_difference - (integer) minimum # of additional genes expanded_in species possesses in contrast to compared_to species (per orthologous group) (!NOTE: set to unrealistically high integer - e.g. 100 - to use only \"min_expansion_factor\" criterium)\n- Nmin_expanded_genes - (integer) minimum # of genes of expanded species required to consider the OG for expansion; this option can be left at 0 for most analyses (ratio/difference selection) but helps if the ratio/difference based methods lead to unexpected results in very small OGs in cases where ploidy normalization was performed\n- expanded_in_all_found - (boolean) does every memeber of expanded_in species have to be present (not expanded!) in the orthologous_group\n- compared_to_all_found - (boolean) does every memeber of compared_to species have to be present (not expanded!) in the orthologous_group\n  \n4) Using the activated environment perform a dry-run and check for problems with:    \n`snakemake -np`  \n   Ignore warning messages (pink) such as \"The code used to generate one or several output files has changed: ...\". \n\n5) Configure the config.yaml file to your needs  \n- here you can adjust options for trimming, thread usage per rule and much more\n- very important are the choices for automatic filtering for longest isoform of fasta files and whether gene or transcript level quantification/diff. exp. analysis should be performed (auto_isoform_filtering: \"NO\" & transcript_level_quantification: \"YES\")\n\t- very stable for standard fasta files from e.g. Ensembl, NCBI, etc.\n\t- when not set to \"YES\", we assume you performed appropiate (or no) filtering yourself\n\t- choosing automatic isoform filtering will create a subset peptide fasta file with only the longest isoform per gene; the header will be shortened to JUST the gene name identifier; this option MUST be used in conjunction with transcript_level_quantification: \"NO\"\n\t- if you perform the filtering yourself and want to perform gene level Diff. Exp. Analysis take care to have the fasta headers for a protein to be the simple gene identifier (no .1; .p3; etc.)\n\t- this is important since for the differential expression analysis we use tximport to reduce the cdna based quantification with tximport/kallisto to gene level (featureCounts if DNA fasta supplied), and association between orthology and expression analysis is the purpose of this software\n\t- IN ANY USE-CASE: THE NAMES BETWEEN PEP. FASTA AND EITHER GENES OR TRANSCRIPTS IN THE SPECIES SPECIFIC GTF HAS TO MATCH!!\n\t- some examples:\n\t\t- case 1. you have standard fasta and annotation files from ensembl/NCBI; want to have one rep. protein seq. per GENE and trust the automatic process -> auto_isoform_filtering: \"YES\" & transcript_level_quantification: \"NO\"\n\t\t- case 2. you filtered for longest isoform yourself (peptide fasta headers = gene names in respective gtf!) and are ok with the names being reduced to gene identifier -> auto_isoform_filtering: \"NO\" & transcript_level_quantification: \"NO\"\n\t\t- case 3. you don't want to our filter & either want to use the whole or a custom subset of the transcriptome -> auto_isoform_filtering: \"NO\" & transcript_level_quantification: \"YES\"; this is the hands-on case in which you the USER are mostly responsible; again, both featureCounts/tximport(kallisto) will produce count tables with the transcript names as found in the gtf; these transcript names have to match the headers in the peptide fasta files (e.g. removing additional info from common fasta headers \"sed '/^>/ s/ .*//' file.fasta\")\n\n\n6) Run A2TEA with (exchange XX for the amount of cores you can offer):  \n`snakemake --cores XX --use-conda`  (add `--use-singularity` if you want to use the singularity image - option 2)  \n- Note that a dry-run can be performed which is likely to tell you of missing files etc. with `snakemake --cores XX --use-conda -np`.  \n- When using the `--use-singularity` option, depending on your compute environment, it can be advantageous to explicitly define the `tmp/` and `cache/` locations. This is due to these locations often defaulting to shared /tmp/ locations that may be quite limited in terms of storage space or general user permissions. To circumvent this, we provide two directories `workflow/singularity_run/tmp/` and `workflow/singularity_run/cache/` which you can use as locations by explicitly defining/exporting the appropiate environment variables:\n\t```\n\texport SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=/full-path-to-A2TEA.Workflow/workflow/singularity_run/tmp/\n\texport SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=/full-path-to-A2TEA.Workflow/workflow/singularity_run/cache/\n\t```\n- Also when using the `--use-singularity` option, be aware to make sure that snakemake can find your input files. One can run into problems when not considering that e.g. some read or fasta files are only linked from a distant directory elsewhere on the filesystem.  \nTo circumvent this, you can make sure that directories are bind-mounted when singularity is run by addtionally specifying e.g.: `--singularity-args '-B /path/to/directory'`.\nGenerally speaking the safest way is always to have all input files as part of the A2TEA.Workflow directory itself.\n"

If you perform isoform filtering yourself, take note that transcripts not found in the pep. fasta won't be part of the downstream phylogenetic and combinatory analyses. These additional transcripts will however be quantified and their differential expression calculated. In the final diff. exp. output HOG_DE.a2tea they will appear but will be put into the singleton category. Depending on your downstream analyses you should consider removing such cases. An easy workaround is simply removing all secondary transcripts/isoforms from the annotation files as well before starting A2TEA.  \n3) Species name between samples.tsv, species.tsv & hypotheses.tsv HAS to match up!  \n4) Add the appropiate path \"path/to/file\" before the files in the species.tsv table  \n5) Do NOT provide both a cDNA and genome fasta for a given species in the species.tsv file!

This means that if you diverge from my standard (= 24 cores) A2TEA will still run, however by modifying the threads for individual rules (in config.yaml / the Snakefile itself) you can improve performance for your particular computational setup.  \n9) With \"auto_isoform_filtering\" you can choose whether to try an automated approach for filtering the peptide fastas for their longest isoform or doing this yourself before starting the workflow. If the option is not set to \"YES\" the filtering is skipped.\n10) With \"add_OGs:\" in the config.yaml you can define the max number of closest orthologous groups to include in the follow-up analyses. The next based blast hit belonging to another OG will lead to include this OG in an addtional set; if set to e.g. 3 for each expanded OG we include the next three \"closest\" OGs\n; if there aren't any usable blast hits less than 3 will be added. Tree visualizations often are more informative if we use more than an individual OG and allow to pinpoint mistakes in the tree generation or the MSA.  \n11) Make sure that hypotheses in the hypotheses.tsv are numbered 1:N and you don't skip any number or start with anoher integer!  \n12) It is possible for a hypothesis to NOT have any expanded OGs - in this case the workflow will provide you with a snakemake error message during the extraction of fasta sequences for expanded OGs: `missing input files for rule fasta_extraction ... wildcards: hypothesis={hypothesis}, OG=empty.txt, ...`. As the dummy file `empty.txt` was written under `tea/{hypothesis}/add_OGs_sets/id_lists/` no expanded OGs exist for the `{hypothesis}`based on the chosen parameters. The user can decide to either adapt parameters or remove the hypothesis from the experiment by deleting it from the config/hypotheses.tsv file. In the latter case, please make sure to adapt the associated hypothesis numbers in the file as well (see 11.)) to 1:N. After this continue/rerun the workflow with the additional flag `--rerun-incomplete`.  \n\n"
