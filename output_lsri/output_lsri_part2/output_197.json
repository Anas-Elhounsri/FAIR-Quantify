Our method extracts features from video and uses them to train a birectional LSTM classifier, which in addition to predicting behavior generates a confidence score for the predicted label. These confidence scores allow for the selective review and correction of ambiguous annotations while omitting unnecessary review.  \nIncluded in this repository is: \n* The code for the workflow\n* The MATLAB app GUIs\n* Project method, configuration file, and GUI documentation\n* And two demonstration projects to cover the entire DeepAction pipeline \n"

Please raise any issues on the issues page of the GitHub repository, and/or contact the [author](#author) in the case of major problems. In the near future, the \"to-do\" items are: \n* Releasing a multiple-camera example project and improving multiple-camera usability.\n* Improved method documentation! (The main methods are covered in [functions.md](./documentation/functions.md), but full details and sufficient in-code documentation is incomplete.)\n* Improving the annotator video viewer to reduce lag.\n* ... and quite a few other miscellaneous items \nIf you're interested in contributing, please reach out! \n"

Scripts can be found in the `examples` folder.\n\n\nTo do demonstrate different facets of the toolbox, we split the demonstration into two sets. In the first, we show how to create a project, extract features, and launch the annotator. The data for this project are a series of short clips (5 minutes each), selected to decrease the time required to generate frames and features. In the second project, we guide users through training and evaluating the classifier and confidence-based review, as well as launching the confidence-review annotator. For this project we provide pre-extracted features, we well as the corresponding annotations, for all the videos in the home-cage dataset.  \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"./documentation/images/workflow.png\" width=\"600\">\n</p>\n"
