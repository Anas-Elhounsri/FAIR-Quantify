        "value": "- KARGVA is based on k-mer probabilistic matching, similarly to his sibling KARGA (https://github.com/DataIntellSystLab/KARGA)\n- KARGVA can be launched from the command line. The minimum input is a read file in (optionally gzipped) FASTQ format, which is automatically detected if the extension is .fastq or .gz. \n- Without other parameters, our manually curated database is used (the latest update is kargva_db_v5.fasta). Our database includes antibiotic resistance gene variants (ARGVs), where the antibiotic resistance is due to specific point mutations in a gene (e.g. in housekeeping genes), integrated from different sources, namely: MEGARes (https://megares.meglab.org/); CARD (https://card.mcmaster.ca/); NDARO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-resistance/). We eliminated sequence redundancy, but kept some heterogeneity in the combination of point mutations. Thus, each sequence can be traced back to one or more original sources; the header contains also information about the combination of aminoacid mutations conferring antibiotic resistance included in the given sequence.\n- Type \"java KARGVA readfile.fastq\" for the default execution. For databases larger than the KARGVA default (kargva_db_v5.fasta), we recommend to use -Xmx16GB or larger.\n- The java class accepts the following optional command line parameters: \"k:your_k_value\" (positive integer for k-mer length, as aminoacids, default value is 9, smaller values are better for higher error rates of the sequencer); \"d:your_db_fasta\" (any database of genes conferring antibiotic resistance thorugh mutations, in FASTA format, where the resistance mutations are specified in the header, see the kargva_db_v5.fasta example); \"f:your_reads_fastq\" (read file in FASTQ format with any file extension); \"i:your_iterr_value (number of iterations to calculate false positive frequency threshold from a customized count hit distribution of random reads, default is 12,500, it will be calibrated on average read length and k-mer length, increase it if the data base size increases or the read length increases, but very large values can slow the program); \"m:[y,yes,n,no]\" (if you want to print the top-scoring ARGV hits for each read, not only the best one, default is yes). \n"

If you have multiple fasta files that should be processed together, such as paired reads R1 and R2 files, you can concatenate them in a single fastq file.\n"
