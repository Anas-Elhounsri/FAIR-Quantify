The details of the GCN and RF architectures are described in our paper (currently under review). \nWe also obtained a dataset with a single classification category that includes 4,539 unique compounds. Subsequently, we created a distinct model specifically for the single-class classification task. You can find the scripts for this model in the *single-class* directory.\n \n"
