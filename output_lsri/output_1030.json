        "value": "Sample size information can be often misspecified in reported GWAS summary statistics. Ideally GWAS sumstats contain per-SNP total sample size for linear regression association statistics and per-SNP case and control sample size for logistic regression association statistics. In practice, for linear and logistic summary statistics, users should provide one of the following sample size information respectively with priority shown below:\n* **Linear regression**: ```n.col``` > ```n.total```\n* **Logistic regression**: ```n.case.col; n.con.col``` > ```n.case; n.con```. If users provide ```n.case; n.con```, ```n.col``` is also recommened to provide.\n\nIf the sumstats don't contain any per-SNP sample size information, this script will impute sample size and conduct QC based on imputed sample size. We follow sample size imputation introduced in [Prive et al. (2022)](https://www.cell.com/hgg-advances/fulltext/S2666-2477(22)00052-5).\n"
