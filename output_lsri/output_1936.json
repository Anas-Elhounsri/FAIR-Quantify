The tool makes use of the previous BLAST search results as it conducts new searches on only the incremental part of the database, recomputes statistical metrics such as e-values and combines these two sets of results to produce updated results. We develop statistics for correcting e-values of any BLAST result against any arbitrary sequence database. The experimental results and accuracy analysis demonstrate that Incremental BLAST can provide search results identical to NCBI BLAST at a significantly reduced computational cost\n![Show](docs/iblast.jpg) \n"

But the user does not need to check for that or take any additional\nsteps to make sure that an incremental search is performed instead of a search from scratch. She will issue the\nsame iBLAST commands as before.\n```\npython3 iBLAST.py \"blastp -db nr -query query.fasta -outfmt 5 -out result.xml\"  \npython3 iBLAST.py \"blastn -db nt -query query.fasta -outfmt 5 -out result.xml\"\n```\nAt time 2, the database has increased by additional y%.

You have some domain knowledge and intuition about its closer relatives in the evolutionary tree and some other sources where it \nmight have picked up some of its proteins. For example, we have sequenced Gall Wasp, which is an insect, so probably searching against the sequences from insect specific taxon would give us\nmost of the homologs. But, there is another interesting observation about Gall Wasp, it spent a long time on Cork Oak tree throughout its evolutionary history and we suspect some beneficial \ngenes/proteins from oak tree might have jumped to Gall Wasp's genome/proteome. So, instead of performing the search against entire nr, we perform several searches against some of the taxa specific databases,\nand combine the result to see if we have gathered enough homologs compared to the result obtained by searching against the entire nr. So, here we correct evalues for each of these search results and then merge them\ntogether. \n"
