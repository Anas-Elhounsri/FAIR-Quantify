        "value": "`HATK`(**HLA Analysis Tool-Kit**) is a collection of tools and modules to perform `HLA fine-mapping` analysis, **which is to identify which HLA allele or amino acid position of the HLA gene is driving the disease**. HLA fine-mapping analysis is an indispensable analysis in studies of autoimmune diseases.\n\nIn `GWAS`(**Genome-wide Association Test**) and its fine-mapping analysis, researchers can obtain candidate causal variants of the target disease. However, the association test performed on the variants in the HLA(Human Leukocyte Antigen) region, chromosome 6p21, usually shows unreliable results because this region has an outlandish polymorphism. Consequently, Performing conventional association test based on SNP array panel may generate inaccurate signals in the HLA region.\n\nOn the other hand, the `IPD-IMGT/HLA`, which is a specialist database, provides the official and most detailed information of the HLA region. Being updated 4 times a year, they keep and manage whole HLA allele information and name those alleles based on the nomenclature defined by the '`WHO Nomenclature Committee For Factors of the HLA System`\u2019. Furthermore, they provide each HLA allele's (1) amino acid and (2) DNA sequence information. To use these data, Exact HLA allele information of patients is required and researchers may have to employ expensive HLA typing technologies. However, thanks to the recent development of HLA imputation and inference technologies, researchers now can obtain hundreds to thousands of patients\u2019 HLA allele information and detour the cost issue of using HLA typing service.\n\nUltimately, HATK aims to perform an association test targeted to the HLA region. Based on patients\u2019 HLA type information and its corresponding Amino acid and DNA sequence information distributed by the IMGT-HLA database, HATK builds a marker panel including not only the typical intergenic genomic variants(i.e. SNPs) markers but also variants of HLA region. Also, HATK provides the additional association test method so that researchers can analyze the signals arising in the amino acid sequence position.\n\n\n![README_Main_Pipeline_WorkFlow](docs/img/README_Main_Pipeline_WorkFlow.png)\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n"

It will be assumed that 'git' command is already installed in your system.\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/WansonChoi/HATK.git\n$ cd HATK\n```\n\n<br>\n\nWe strongly recommend using 'Anaconda(or Miniconda)' to set up HATK.\n\n1. Install Anaconda or Miniconda.\n\n    - Anaconda : (https://www.anaconda.com/)\n    - Miniconda : (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\n\n\tMiniconda is a minimal version of Anaconda with fewer default packages. I recommend Miniconda if you want less storage uptake.\n\n<br>\n\n2. Create a new independent Python virtual environment for HATK with the given YML file.\n\n\tBy using the 'HATK_LINUX.yml' or 'HATK_OSX.yml' file in the project folder **depending on your operating system**, Create a new Python virtual environment.\n    \n\t```\n\t$ conda env create -f HATK_OSX.yml          ## OS X(Mac)\n\t$ conda env create -f HATK_LINUX.yml        ## Linux\n\t```\n\t\n\tThe above command will generate a new Python virtual environment named 'HATK', which contains dependent Python packages, R and R libraries, independent to your original Python system. \n\t\n\tFor more detailed explanation about how Anaconda manages Python virtual environment, Please check this reference(https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually).\n\n<br>\n\n3. Activate the HATK environment.\n\n\tIf the new virtual environment has been succuessfully installed, then activate it.\n\n\t```\n\t$ conda activate HATK    # HATK will be implemented in this virtual environment.\n\t```\n\n\n> (Tip) Type '_conda deactivate_' if you want to go back to the previous environment. (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#deactivating-an-environment)\n\n\n> (Tip) Type '_conda env remove -n HATK_' if you want to remove this newly created virtual environment for HATK forever.
