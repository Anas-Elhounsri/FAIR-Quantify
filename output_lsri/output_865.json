        "value": "There are many software packages available for next-gen sequencing\nanalysis, here are some of the reasons to use RTG:\n\n* Comprehensive, cohesive, fast, sensitive and accurate variant\n  calling pipeline from FASTQ through to high-quality variants.\n* Robust, easy to use, and well supported.\n* Fast and accurate alignment, supporting popular sequencing\n  technologies, including alignment of Complete Genomics Inc reads.\n* Automatic base-quality recalibration computed on-the-fly during\n  mapping and applied during variant calling.\n* Variant calling both simple SNPs and complex haplotypes,\n  automatically realigning when necessary.\n* Pedigree-aware pipeline, joint Bayesian calling of multiple samples\n  in pedigrees with varying degrees of relatedness, from unrelated,\n  trios, quads, half-siblings, larger families, multi-generation pedigrees.\n* Pedigree-aware joint calling automatically includes de novo\n  discovery, including specific confidence scoring that the variant is\n  de novo. Again, this includes information from larger families where\n  available, not just trios. Offspring variant calls are automatically\n  phased from inheritance.\n* Variant calling allows specification of population priors in either\n  from general population variants or those in previously called\n  samples.\n* Sex-aware pipeline, automatically mapping to the correct chromosomes\n  for the sex of the sample, performing diploid or haploid variant\n  calling as appropriate (including PAR regions).\n* Joint Bayesian somatic variant detection, including support for\n  contamination, and providing post-calling updated contamination\n  estimate. Supports site-specific somatic mutation priors that allow\n  databases such as dbSNP/COSMIC/etc. to support the somatic calling.\n* Tools for quality control and sample checking: coverage analysis,\n  detection of chromosome abnormalities, verification of sex, sample\n  mislabelling, incorrect pedigree.\n* Includes sophisticated variant comparison tools for benchmarking and\n  ROC analysis to guide variant scoring and filtering.  Including tool\n  for visualization of ROC information between runs.\n* Fast and comprehensive metagenomic analysis pipelines.\n* Species frequency composition and abundance analysis, including\n  bounds estimates and confidence scores both at the species and\n  higher taxon levels.\n* Species reported using both tabular data reports and interactive\n  Krona HTML pie charts.\n* Contaminant filtering and sample similarity analysis.\n* Includes tools for building and managing species reference databases\n  that include taxonomic structure (prebuilt databases are also\n  available).\n* Search reads directly against protein databases for functional\n  analysis.\n* Reproducible results: unlike many other tools, the results don't\n  change when you enable multi-threading or when you repeat the same\n  run twice.\n\n\nRTG Core is available pre-packaged directly from our\n[website](http://realtimegenomics.com/products/rtg-core/), or follow\nthe instructions below to build from this repository.\n"
