        "value": "*peakonly* is a novel approach written in Python (v3.6) for peaks (aka features) detection in raw LC-MS data. The main idea underlying the approach is the training of two subsequent artificial neural networks to firstly classify ROIs (regions of interest) into ~~three~~ two classes (noise, peaks, ~~uncertain peaks~~) and then to determine boundaries for every peak to integrate its area. Current approach was developed for the high-resolution LC-MS data for the purposes of metabolomics, but can be applied with several adaptations in other fields that utilize data from high-resolution GC- or LC-MS techniques. \n"
