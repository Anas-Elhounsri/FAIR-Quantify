In this way, numerous enzymes have been found out and some of them have industrial applications. Also, with the development of structure-related computational methods involving docking and modeling, rational design and even de novo design of new enzymes have become a reality. \nThe accumulation of sequences ensures us unlimited biomineral and the development of structure-related computational methods endue us powerful tools to mine more effectively and completely. \n"
