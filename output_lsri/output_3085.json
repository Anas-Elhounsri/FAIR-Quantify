        "value": "DscoreApp can be used both locally and online. \n\nTo use DscoreApp locally, R and RStudio IDE have to be installed. The following R packages have to be installed as well: `shiny`, `shinjs`, `shinythemes`, and `ggplot2`. You can use the following code to install them: \n\n`install.packages(c(\"shiny\", \"shinyjs\", \"shinythemes\", \"ggplot2\"))`\n\nOnce you have installed these packages, download the `DscoreApp.Rproj`, `ui.R` and `server.R` files. If you open either the `ui.R` or the `server.R` file, you will find the `Run App` command on the top right side of the R script. By clicking on the `Run App`, the app will start working on your computer, and it will automatically call for the abovementioned packages. If you want to use the example dataset locally on your computer, you have to download it (`raceAPP.csv` file), save it into a working directory, and change the working dircetory on LINE 23 in `server.R` file accordingly.\n\n\nDscoreApp can be used online as well, without the need of installing anything locally. The suggested browser for using the app online is Google Chrome. The app is retriavable at the URL: http://fisppa.psy.unipd.it/DscoreApp/\n\n"

Data needs to be saved in a CSV format, with comma set as column separator. \n\nOnce data have been updated, the drop-down menus for the IAT blocks labels are populated with the labels identifying the four blocks in the user's dataset. Once the labels have been specificied, the `Prepare data` button becomes active, and, after it has been clicked and the data are ready for the actual *D-score* computation, the `Data are ready` message is appearing right next the button. \n\nOnce the data are ready, any *D-score* can be chosen from the drop-down menu, according to users' preferences. Different options for both the respondents' deletion and the graphical display of the results are available as well. The appearance of the app once the results are displyed and examples of the available graphical options are illustrated on the pdf of the paper in the app [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OttaviaE/DscoreApp).\n\nFor further information on the app functioning, please refer to the related paper retrivable at [![DOI](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01764/status.svg)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01764).\n\n"
