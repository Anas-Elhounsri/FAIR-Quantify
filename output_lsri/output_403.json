        "value": "**1. GENERAL INFORMATION**\n   \n**C**ontour **R**OI **I**dentification, **S**imulation, and **P**rofiling (CRISP) is the novel platform that integrates multiple existing and new state-of-art deep learning (DL) platforms for untargeted profiling of Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography and Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS)-generated data in terms of contour data. The open-source software toolkit is responsible for feature detection, simulation, data enhancement, and classification of GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS-generated contour for the untargeted metabolite profiling. The integrated platform has a novel ability to automatically construct aggregate feature representative contour (AFRC) from a group of supplied contour data belonging to different classes/groups to reduce manual selection biases and subsequently auto-identify contrasting regions of interest (ROIs) within this contour based on AFRC. These ROIs can be algorithmically detected and stacked together, using our algorithm termed as \u201cDeepstacking*\u201d to create a new representative feature map that maximizes the contrasting features and maximizes the profiling accuracy for each group during classifier training. The Integrated Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the main engine that simulates the synthetic Contour data based on the real samples. The Integrated GAN in use is a modified version of SGAN/WGAN that minimizes gradient vanishing and Lipschitz Constraint contained in general SGAN and WGANs. The synthesized output is computed for Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) to evaluate their quality of likeliness to the source data. The integrated modules have the framework for efficient high-resolution contour image synthesis (64\u00d764 - 512\u00d7512 pixels) along with customizable contour intensity manipulation. The synthesized images can be subjected to a contour image super-resolution (SR) model based on Cascading Residual Network. The CRISP\u2019s SR network is fully customizable. It has been customized by default and trained using our Contour-like high resolution (HR) dataset to maximize the model\u2019s capabilities to enhance contour image data. The Classifier is a collection of a customized version of a state-of-art Convolutional neural network (CNN) including VGG16/VGG19/Inception/RasNet/DenseNet for detecting features and obtaining maximum efficient models.  Instead of the usual 224\u00d7224 Input dimensions, the model can input (224\u00d7244 or 512\u00d7512) dimensions along with a customizable model optimizer feature to maximize the contour feature detection capabilities. All models once trained can be restored, continued training, and used independently to inference their corresponding inputs. All models created by Contour Profiler have their summary, ROIs Deep stacking coordinates, logs, and training history including models losses, FIDs*  and qScores* stored whenever applicable. Taken together, the CRISP provides an all-in-one open source integrated platform for advanced profiling of non-targeted GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS Contour data. [Note: * see article for details] \n \n \n**2. SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE AND ITS USES**\n  \nThe CRISP is designed for GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS and consists of four major components: \nA.                ROI & Deep Stacking \nB.                GAN-based Contour Training & Synthesis \nC.                Coutour Enhancement \nD.                Contour Classifier Training & Inference \nEach module can be used independently or in combination for the opted outcome. However, the method can be applied for any other contour images of similar 2D datatype.Note: All steps A-D should be done for the same Mode during inference of unknown sample. \n\n ## CRISP has a Full operational graphical user interface (GUI) which allows easy opration of each modules\n \n <img src=\"/images/crisp_gui.jpg\" alt=\"Friendly graphical user interface to carry out all operations\"/>\n \n CRISP has myriad of option in GUI which cannot be demonstrated here.The substancial amount of details can be found in the Supplimentary Materials section of the article\n   \n"

        "value": "\u2022Manually choose ROI (1A.  Manual ROI selection): This section allows the user to manually select a single ROI graphically or based on input coordinates. It allows cropping of the region to get a single desired ROI with multiple additional options such as resizing, applying image filters, and output file type selection options. The extraction of initial contour data can be done in Normal RGB color mode which uses a pre-trained neural network for holistic edge-based feature extraction). Please note, once the Contour data is extracted in a certain mode, the same mode setting should be followed for all contour groups and future inferencing. Selection of ROI for only a single image per group folder is required, all images in the folder will be extracted for the same ROIs automatically. \n\u2022General Protocol: (1A. Manual ROI selection tab) Select single images from each group --> Select single ROI/entire image from Contour -->  Extract ROIs (new folder will be created with extracted ROIs for all Contours). (Can apply additional mode filters like resizing, denoise as described earlier) \n    \n\u2022 AFRC construction (1B. Build AFRC): This is a novel procedure that allows the generalization of the groups of contour images that belong to pre-defined profiles in terms of weighted aggregate feature extraction. This allows dominant features to represent exclusively in the final single representative image and scarce or outliner features will be minimized algorithmically. This will result in a final AFRC, which will represent common/average dominant major features present in the group, and reduces manual selection bias. The parameters such as FPS, weight accumulation factor, and cyclic image duration will control the number of features to be represented in the final AFRI image. Several image augmentation features (e.g.: blur, noise, erosion, dilation) can be applied during the construction of AFRC image to enhance its coverage of the profile feature. The AFRI image can be automatically fetched into the subsequent module for AutoROI detection & DeepStacking. \n\u2022General protocol:  (1B. Build AFRC tab) Select any image from the Cropped ROI folder from 1A for two different classes of Contours --> Set the parameters (or use default) and apply filters if desired --> Process AFRC  \n\u2022 Multiple ROIs detection & Feature-based dataset construction (1C. AutoROIs and Deep Stacking): This module does multiple important tasks related to final database construction for Contour simulation and classification. The module has several customized models/algorithmic means to identify multiple ROIs between two AFRI images. These include retrained: VGG16 (more preferred CNN model), SIAMESE, SSIM, PNSR, Hamming, and FID (details in publication paper). The top-N number of ROIs are identified based on user settings: Similarity threshold, scanning window size, window overlapping amounts. During processing, the scanning window from left to right will evaluate the features of Contour data in AFRI images and output the scores of each window area and a list of coordinates with scores will be generated for top-N least similar regions. There is an option to view a graph of the scores along the R1 dimension of the contour data. Then the contour feature images for all individual contours in each group can be generated as \u201cDeepStacked\u201d images using the DeepStack dataset builder. This feature-stacked dataset can be used for simulation instead of simulating entire contour plots for amplifying the contrasting features between different profiles. Once, the Deepstacking dataset is generated, it can be used for simulation of the feature vectors that will be further used for classification. \n\u2022General Protocol:  (1C. AutoROIs and Deep Stacking Tab) Select single images from each group  -->  Select AFRC contour image for each class  -->  Set the correct Scoring method (default is VGG16) --> Set the window shifting parameters --> Run the Compute ROIs --> Build DeepStacking Dataset  \n[Note: *You can skip this section if you want to use entire contour plot for the simulation and classification. However, if you use this option, the same ROIs deep stacking configuration should be used for all steps in CRISP]. \n     \n"

The generator can train the model from 64\u00d764 - 512\u00d7512 pixel contours with limited sample size and good outcome. The larger sample size can provide better results based on the diversity of the original images. There is an option to set hyperparameters and details options for setting FIDs, Z-vectors, RELU, Learning rates and model Optimizers (B. Contour synthesis --> 1. Hyperparameters). The image augmentation (B. Contour synthesis --> 2. Augmentation) tab allows the addition of multiple different filters (e.g: dilation, distortion, erosion, contrast, brightness, noise, edge sharpening, etc.) to initially expand the diversity of limited contours being fed to the generator without actually creating any significant change in the overall profile of the input contours. This enhances the dataset for the generator to train better especially in low-sample conditions. The real-time graphs of model loss and preview of the model along with FID curves will be shown during training for getting the status of the generator. The qScore (which forms qCurve) is a customized matrix that will tentatively indicate the quality of the output mainly based on the sharpness/blurriness feature of the synthetic image during training as compared to the original contour image distribution. If the sharpness of images is relatively similar to that of source data, the qScore will approximately be equal to 1.7. This score gives the user the trend of ongoing simulation training as a real-time update during model training. The training models and their history can be stored/restored at any point of the training along with the configuration. Once the model is trained enough (based on FID curves, Model loss, and preview images) the model can be used for synthesizing entirely new contour plots without requiring original datasets (B. Contour synthesis --> 3. Synthesize) in a customizable grid of 1\u00d71 \u2013 10\u00d710 shape. There is also a novel advanced option to control the intensity of entities in the synthesized Contour which in the real situation often relates to the concentration of metabolites. This feature works best when the source images have a minimum of background noise or column bleeding.  The image augmentation feature can be applied to the synthesized output contours as well which will assist in increasing the diversity of the synthesized samples. The advanced features of manipulating the Z-vector cab lead to higher diversity of the generated samples. It must be the same with the same ROIs/DeepStacking (if applied earlier). The source data is not required once the model is trained enough. All models are compatible for continued training.  \n\u2022General protocol:  (B.

The data sets are separated into training and validation sets for evaluating both training and validation accuracy, receiver operator curves, and model loss function.
