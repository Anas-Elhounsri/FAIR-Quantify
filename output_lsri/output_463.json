        "value": "The goal is to build a classification model that takes a region of the genome as input and predicts the region\u2019s susceptibility to develop an environmentally induced transgenerational alteration in differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) in the F3 generation from an ancestrally exposed F0 generation (great grandmother).  \nThe DL network is used to learn features, which are extracted and used as the input features for an XGBoost model to build a classifier for predicting DMRs (or any other classification task). The approach defaults to using a 1000bp DNA sequence as input, but can be used for any DNA classification problem with a minor modification in the shape of the input data. The main features of this project are:  \n* Multi-class classification using deep learning and machine learning algorithm.\n* Interpretation of learned structures (motifs) in DNA sequences using a modified version of the [pysster](https://github.com/budach/pysster) package.\n* Train a hybrid model on DNA sequences using a one-hot encoding representation. \n* Test a pre-trained model on a dataset (Input: one-hot encoding NumPy array of DNA sequences, labels)\n* Train and test 5-fold cross-validation and report the classification results on the dataset. \n* Visualize the kernels of convolutional and dense layers.\n* Hand-crafted features can also be added to XGBoost by modifying the input argument of the `fit_ml_classifier` function.\n \n"

Note that three of the datasets below (Atrazine, DDT, Vinclozolin) use 100bp regions that would need to be combined into 1000bp regions, and two of the datasets (DDT, Vinclozolin) have four p-values (tnt.edgeR.pv, pnp.edgeR.pv, knk.edgeR.pv, mnm.edgeR.pv), one of which would need to be chosen, before used in the Hybrid code. The other exposures consist of multiple datasets based on observed pathology.
