These can be used to build a vocabulary for text annotation, including new methods for synonym and label expansion. Annotation is performed using Stanford CoreNLP, and include novel methods for the detection and disambiguation of concept negation and uncertainty. Annotations of text corpora can be used for analysis, within or without Komenti. These components are in development, but currently include summarisation of the co-ocurrence of groups of concepts across text, and use of annotations to suggest description logic axioms for classes. These more complex uses can be described by series of parameters to be passed to the tool in the form of a serialised 'roster,' defining a natural language processing pipeline. \n* [Komenti: A semantic text mining framework](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.233049v1)\n  * A general description of the tool and a use case with a practical application.

Try reducing the number of threads, and trying again later (there seems to be a throttling thing going on).\n* When one argument isn't parsed correctly, the other ones won't work.

        "description": "Expanded query functionality, which is the main purpose for the release, alongside some fixes, improved documentation, integration of our binary relations ontology extension module, and additional experimental functionality. You can find out how to install this release [here](https://github.com/reality/komenti_guide/blob/master/installation.md), and this repo also includes helpful guides (you can also see the README.md of this repository for a more complete explication of options).\r\n\r\n- Added --direct query parameter to retrieve only direct super and subclasses matching your query\r\n- Added --class-mode, which will return only one label per IRI. Useful if you're interested in querying for classes themselves, rather than their vocabulary.\r\n- Better error handling around AberOWL API problems\r\n- Fix some bugs around navigating directories and annotating singular files\r\n- Better documentation\r\n- Fixes for object property retrieval\r\n- Ontology extension from text modules (see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.411751v1 )\r\n- Experimental elasticsearch functionality. This is very incomplete, I would not attempt to use it yet unless you want to add/edit code yourself.",
