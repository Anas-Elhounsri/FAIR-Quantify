Functional annotations of the genome may help to prioritize variants that are biologically relevant and thus improve fine-mapping of GWAS results.\n\nTo fine-map causal variants, SparsePro takes two lines of evidence. First, with GWAS summary statistics and matched LD information, we jointly infer both the causal status of each effect group for traits as well as variant representation within each effect group. Second, we estimate the functional enrichment of causal variants and prioritize variants according to relevant functional information. As outputs, our method yields variant-level PIP estimates, set-level posterior summary as well as enrichment estimates of functional annotations.\n"

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\nabsence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\nfulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\nTreaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\nagreements.\n\nd. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\nany other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\nthat applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\ne. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\nor other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\nLicense.\n\nf. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\nterms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\nall Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\nLicensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\ng. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\nunder this Public License.\n\nh. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards\ncommercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of\nthis Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for\nother material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital\nfile-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is\nno payment of monetary compensation in connection with the\nexchange.\n\ni. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\nprocess that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\nas reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\ndissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\navailable to the public including in ways that members of the\npublic may access the material from a place and at a time\nindividually chosen by them.\n\nj. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\nresulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\nthe Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\nas amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\nequivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nk.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n            b. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material\n               for NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\na. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n          For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under\n          this Public License to Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\nto extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\nportion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\nonly and provided You do not Share Adapted Material;\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\ncontents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\nRights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\nRights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\nall or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\na. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\nEXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\nAND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\nANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\nIMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\nWARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\nKNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\nALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nb. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\nTO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\nNEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\nCOSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\nUSE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\nDAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\nIN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\nabove shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\npossible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\nwaiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\nSimilar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\nthis Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\nterminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\nSection 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\nLicensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\ndistributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\nwill not terminate this Public License.\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\nLicense.\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\nterms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\nLicensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\nindependent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\nshall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\nconditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\nbe made without permission under this Public License.\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\ndeemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\ncannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\nwithout affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\nconditions.\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\nfailure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\nLicensor.\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\nas a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\nthat apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\nprocesses of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.
