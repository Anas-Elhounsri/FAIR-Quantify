JUMPt uses a novel differential equation-based mathematical model to calculate the reliable and accurate protein turnover rates. The proposed method calculates the half-life of individual proteins by fitting the dynamic data of unlabeled free Lys and protein-bound Lys from individual proteins simultaneously.\r\n\r\nJUMPt is part of JUMP Software Suite (shortly JUMP), is an ongoing large software suite developed for the need of mass spectrometry (MS)- based proteomics, metabolomics, and the integration with genomics for network analysis at the level of systems biology. Currently, JUMP can handle protein/peptide database creation, database search, identification filtering, quantification, and network, proteogenomics, and protein turnover analysis.\r\n\r"
