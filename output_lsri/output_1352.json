Changed the default title names.\r\n  * Removed main panel title in plots\r\n  * Fixed default colors and removed mislabled `midpoint` color\r\n  * Removed annotation from `plot.ppp()` in plot #3 and plot #2 (if points are not plotted)\r\n  * Added `scale` argument to scale text for higher resolution plots\r\n  * Added `horizontal` argument to toggle the display of the color key to be on the right (vertical) or bottom (horizontal) of plots\r\n  * Added `plot_axes` argument to toggle the display of axes in plots\r\n  * Added `plot_square` argument to toggle the margins of plots\r\n  * Changed the value of `cex.axis` and `cex` in plots\r\n  * Updated documentation with correct order of `cols`\r\n* Changes to `jitter_power()`\r\n  * Added `p_correct` argument to apply a multiple testing correction\r\n  * Specified all packages for functions\r\n  * Deprecated `cascon` argument (moved to `spatial_plots()` function)\r\n  * Estimates case-only power (lower tail) and case/control (lower and upper tail) and captures both outputs. Case-only is now a one-tailed hypothesis test by default. The arguments `lower_tail` and `upper_tail` have been replaced with argument `alpha`\r\n  * Used `as.solist()` to specify appropriate class to lists\r\n  * Updated example to reflect new updates\r\n* Changes to vignette\r\n  * Set global chunk options\r\n  * Named code chunks\r\n  * Increased the `sim_total` value for a more realistic example\r\n  * Specify all packages for functions\r\n  * Updated code to reflect updates to functions in `sparrpowR`\r\n  * Updated code to use `sf` package\r\n  * Updated explanation of the `cascon` argument to plot various hypothesis tests\r\n  * Changed `cols` values to be more visible \r\n  * Used `cut` instead of `reclassify` in `raster` package for categorical plot\r\n  * Created a new section called \"Advanced Features\" that has a new example run in parallel with a False Discovery Rate procedure. \r\n  * Added detail about fewer-than-expected simulated point locations in the first example\r\n  * Updated plots that spatially project data with CRS strings for PROJ6\r\n* Added utils.R file\r\n  * Removed the helper `comb()` function functions from `jitter_power()`, `spatial_power()`, and `spatial_plots()` and added to the utils.R file\r\n  * Removed `utils` package from Imports because the progress bar in `spatial_power()` and `jitter_power()` functions is now produced with a helper `progBar()` function\r\n* Added zzz.R file\r\n* Added package.R file\r\n* Updated testthat checks for parallelization and multiple testing correction in `spatial_power()` and `jitter_power()` functions",
