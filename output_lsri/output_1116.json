The power of this package is that it allows to perform meta-analysis on highly heterogeneneous transcriptomic data. Classical co-expression analyses is sensitive to outliers and require high-quality homogenous data, especially in terms of platform. To overcome this limitation we developed a simpler method that uses previously computed differential expression analyses. This allows to apply the suitable method for each specific platform (e.g. moderated t-statistics for microarray and negative binomial for RNA-sequencing data) and thereafter, integrating the results by simply analyzing the already computed log2 fold changes and adjusted p-values.\n"

We also computed an original statistics that we called \"pseudo t-score\" corresponding to the ratio of the mean log2FC over the standard deviation of the log2FCs divided by the square root of the number of comparisons. This statistics will therefore be negative for overall downregulated genes and positive for overall upregulated genes and its absolute value will be higher for those genes with high and consistent changes in several comparisons, and lower for inconsistent and variable fold changes (e.g. upregulated in some datasets and downregulated in others) that are found only in a few comparisons. \n"

By analysing our Down syndrome transcriptomic dataset we found that co-DE genes tend to: (1) be involved in the same gene or (2) disease ontology or in (3) physical and functional interactions reported in STRINGdb or (4) in the same genomic region. Co-differential expression analysis has not to be confused with co-expression analysis. Co-expression between two genes means that gene levels across sample correlate, while in our case it means that the two genes are both differentially expressed in different comparisons. Coming back to our example with DYRK1A by using the `find_coDE` function we found that this gene was found co-DE with 2798 other genes. The most frequent co-DE interactions occurred with five genes that were found co-DE together with DYRK1A in 4 comparisons: CSF2RB (ENSG00000100368), PFKL (ENSG00000141959), USP16 (ENSG00000156256), PAXBP1 (ENSG00000159086), and BRWD1 (ENSG00000185658).

You can whether pass to the function the whole dataset with the option `top=50` or pass the previously computed dataframes: one with the statistics and one with the co-differential expression results. We already computed the statistics for the most frequent 50 genes. We then pass these genes as input to the `find_coDE` function to create our co-DE dataframe. When `find_coDE` receives a vector of genes instead of a single gene it only retrieves co-DE interactions between the genes given as input. Thereafter, we pass both the dataframe with statistics and the one with co-DE interactions to the `plot_gene_coDE_network`. This plot a graph where each node is a gene whose size is proportional to the number of occurrences, and each edge is a co-DE interaction with thickness proportional to the number of comparisons in which a given interaction was found. \nAs you can see only one gene is downregulated, corresponding to intergrin beta 8 which is crucial for neurogenesis and neurovascular homeostasis regulation may affect Down syndrome neuropathology. \nIf you wants to know more about the Down syndrome dataset used in this vignette please visit this web application: \n"
