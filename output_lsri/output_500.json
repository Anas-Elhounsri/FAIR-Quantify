        "value": "Gene expression data is commonly used at the intersection of cancer research and machine learning for better understanding of the molecular status of tumour tissue. Deep learning predictive models have been employed for gene expression data due to their ability to scale and remove the need for manual feature engineering. However, gene expression data is often very high dimensional, noisy, and presented with a low number of samples. This poses significant problems for learning algorithms: models often overfit, learn noise, and struggle to capture biologically relevant information.  \nGINCCo offers one method to tackle this issue by constructing computational graphs for the input gene expression data that incorporate prior knowledge embedded in the structure of gene interaction graphs such as protein-protein interaction networks. The structural construction of the computational graphs is driven by the use of topological clustering algorithms on protein-protein networks which incorporate inductive biases stemming from network biology research in protein complex discovery. Each of the entities inside of the computational graph constructed by GINCCo represent biological entities such as genes, candidate protein complexes, and phenotypes; allowing for introspective study of the learned functions. Furthermore it provides a biologically relevant mechanism for regularisation often yielding better predictive performance as we show in the paper.\n \n"
