This should be performed with caution and with the knowledge of your organism.  Filtering of sequences which are frequently of plasmid origin but are not in your organism is the primary use case we envision for this feature.\n```\n### User sequence mask\n% mob_recon --infile assembly.fasta --outdir my_out_dir --filter_db filter.fasta\n```\nAs of v. 3.0.0, we have provided the ability to use a collection of closed genomes which will be quickly checked using Mash for genomes which are genetically close and limit blast searches to those chromosomes. This more nuanced and automatic approach is recommended for users where there are sequences which should be filtered in one genomic context but not another. We provide as [an optional download](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3785351) a set of closed Enterobacteriacea genomes from NCBI which can be used to provide added accuracy for some organisms such as E. coli and Klebsiella where there are sequences which switch between chromosome and plasmids.\n<br><br>\nIf reconstructed plasmids exceed the Mash distance for primary cluster assignment, then they will be assigned a name in the format novel_{md5} where the md5 hash is calculated based on all of the sequences belonging to that reconstructed plasmid. This will provide a unique name for the plasmids but any change will result in a corresponding change in the md5 hash. It is therefore not advised to use these assigned names for further analyses. Rather they should be highlighted as cases where targeted long read sequencing is required to obtain a closer database representative of that plasmid.\n```\n### Autodetected close genome filter\n% mob_recon --infile assembly.fasta --outdir my_out_dir -g 2019-11-NCBI-Enterobacteriacea-Chromosomes.fasta\n```\n \n"

        "description": "This release includes small but important convenience fixes such as fix to #152 issue where in cases when there are absolutely no plasmid biomarkers (i.e. empty biomarkers report) `mob_typer` would fail. Additionally, this release improves marker reporting consistency between biomarkers and the main plasmid typing reports generated by mob_recon and mob_typer. The biomarkers report introduced since v3.1.7 lists the main plasmid biomarkers and their coordinates. Finally, plasmid databases were cleaned, synced and redundant files removed. A new databases archive url was updated and now points to https://zenodo.org/records/10304948/files/data.tar.gz?download=1\r\n\r\n-\tFixed permanently issue #152 and added a unit test `test_mob_recon_no_plasmid_biomarkers()`\r\n-\tUpdated the core database archive `data.tar.gz`: a) removed redundant `host_range_ncbirefseq_plasmidDB.txt` and  `host_range_ncbirefseq_plasmidDB.csv`; b) updated `clusters.txt` with new `mob_typer` biomarker results for consistency (the cluster codes and number of records did not change) \r\n-\tImproved biomarkers report consistency with other reports by making sure that all markers listed in the `mob_typer` report are present in the biomarkers report. Implemented a new unit tests listed in `test_databases_consistency.py`\r\n",

Clusters are now issued accession numbers instead of numeric codes in the format of [A-Z][A-Z][0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] to prevent any mixed use of clusters from previous versions. Mappings of samples to previous codes is provided in cluster_mapping.txt\r\n\u2022\tReference database of plasmids has increased to ~23K closed plasmid sequences for use in reconstruction and comparison\r\n\u2022\tBiomarker databases have had minor changes to incorporate new sequences and updates to nomenclature\r\n\u2022\tAdded functionality for users to supply sequences at runtime for MOB-recon to ignore based on their specific datasets\r\n\u2022\tAdded functionality for chromosome depletion based on closed reference sequences. This is a more flexible approach than the user defined filter sequences as it will only use close genomes for filtering.\r\n\u2022\tMOB-typer now allows for processing batches of unrelated plasmids in the same file using the \u2013multi flag\r\n\u2022\tImproved performance by re-using MOB-recon biomarker results instead of calling MOB-typer on each reconstructed plasmid\r\n\u2022\tRemoved dependency on circulator and incorporated an overhang detection using a process similar to berroka https://github.com/tseemann/berokka\r\n\u2022\tOutput files produced by MOB-suite have changed and may break any existing pipelines based on the output files\r\n\r\n",
