        "value": "# Contributing\n\nThis document explains how, technically, to contribute to this project. A code of conduct may be available in the root\nof this repository, or included in the readme.\n\n## Contribution Workflow\n\n- Check the issues and draft pull requests to see if anyone is working on something similar.\n- Make a branch for your contribution. If it is a bug fix for the current working version then you should branch from\n  `master`. If you are working on new features then please branch from `dev`.\n- Implement your feature, bug fix, documentation, etc. using commits.\n- Push your changes.\n- Make a pull request against the branch from which you originally branched from (`master` for bug fixes; `dev` for new features).\n\nYou are advised to make a draft pull request as soon as you start work so nobody else ends up working on the same thing.\n\n## Software Architecture\n\n`topostats` is currently arranged as a Python module in the `topostats/` folder. Other scripts in this repository are\nnot currently considered core elements of `topostats` apart from `Plotting.py`.\n\nCurrently the `topostats` module consists of:\n\n- `default_config.ini` The default config file.\n- `dnatracing.py` Applies tracing functions to each molecule.\n- `pygwytracing.py` The \"main\" routine.\n- `tracingfuncs.py` Skeletonises and generates backbone traces from masks.\n\nThe current working plan is to move to a more modular architecture with new (and existing) functionality being grouped\nby theme within files. We expect to add such files as:\n\n- `filters.py` Raster image filters (e.g. Gaussian blur).\n- `morphology.py` Morphological operations (e.g. identify connected components).\n- `curves.py` Operations on vectorised \"1D\" shapes (e.g. determine curvature).\n- `file_io.py` Input and output (e.g. load proprietary AFM data formats).\n- `plottingfuncs.py` Output plot functions (e.g. generate various plots for raw and processed AFM datasets).\n\nThese can then be called by a \"main\" routine that performs batch analysis, and functions within them tested in isolation\nusing `pytest` and reused in arbitrary contexts.\n\nObject oriented approaches will be used where appropriate, but not seen as inherently superior to \"functional\"\napproaches which can be easier to maintain. Existing object orientation will be reviewed with this in mind.\n\n## Coding Style\n\n- [ ] There is no coding style.\n- [x] [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the preferred coding style, but is not mandated.\n- [ ] Code must be PEP8 compliant.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [ ] There is no preferred style for documentation, but documentation is required.\n- [ ] [PEP257 docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) are required.\n- [x] [Numpy docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) are required.\n\n## [Typehints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)\n\n- [ ] Do not use typehints.\n- [x] Typehints are optional, but encouraged.\n- [ ] Typehints are required.\n\n## Tests\n\n- [x] The [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) framework is used and tests are encouraged.\n- [ ] Code must be covered by unit tests. The `pytest` framework is used.\n\nTo run tests:\n\n```bash\npython -m pytest\n```\n\n### Updating tests that use `.csv.bz2` files\n\nHere is an example of how to add / update tests that rely on creating \\_.csv.bz2 files:\nPlace the following in the test before generating/calling the fixture from `conftest.py` in the test arguments, run it, then\ncomment it out / remove it, then run it again with the fixture and check if the test passes. This generates the data and\nsaves it such that next time you run the tests, it will get picked up for testing against.\n\n```bash\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame(quadratic_removed)\ndf.to_csv(\"tests/resources/image_random_remove_quadratic.csv.bz2\", index=False, header=False)\n```\n\n## Static Analysis\n\n- [x] Use [`pylint`](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) to analyse your code before submission.\n\n## Debug using docker\n\n1. Install vscode.\n2. Click \"Open a Remote Window\".\n3. Click \"Reopen in container\".\n4. Run the debugger as normal.\n\n## Using pycharm and GitHub\n\nCheck the issues and draft pull requests.\n\n![Check the issues and draft pull requests.](assets/issues-prs.png)\n\nMake a branch for your contribution.\n\n![Make a branch for your contribution.](assets/pycharm-branch.png)\n\nAdd any new files to `git` (i.e. stage them).\n\n![Add any new files to `git` (i.e. stage them).](assets/stage.png)\n\nCommit the changes (with a sensible message).\n\n![Commit the changes (with a sensible message).](assets/commit.png)\n\n> Add / commit multiple times to break your contribution into easy to follow chunks.\n\nPush changes.\n\n![Push changes.](assets/push.png)\n\nMake a pull request.\n\n![Make a pull request.](assets/pull-request.png)\n"

If your problem isn't covered\nthen please do not hesitate to ask a question.\n\nTopoStats is a [Python](https://www.python.org) package designed to run at the command line. If you are using Microsoft\nWindows you should use\n[Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/01-getting-started?view=powershell-7.3).\nYou may have Python installed on your system but should use a [Python Virtual\nEnvironment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) such as\n[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and install and use TopoStats under the Virtual\nEnvironment. The versions of Python supported are Python >=3.8 and so when creating your virtual environment you should\nspecify this `3.8` as the minimum.\n\n## Setting up Conda\n\nOnce you have downloaded and installed [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) you can create a\nvirtual environment for installing TopoStats for installing and running TopoStats. We will call this environment `topostats`\n(specified with the `--name topostats` option) and use Python 3.10 (the option `python=3.10`). After creating it we can,\nas per the instructions printed out, activate the environment.\n\n```bash\nconda create --name topostats python=3.10\nconda activate topostats\n```\n\nYou are now ready to install TopoStats.\n\n**NB** If you are using an Apple M1 Macbook then you need to install Anaconda >=\n[2022.05](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/new-release-anaconda-distribution-now-supporting-m1).\n\n## Installing TopoStats\n\nThere are two options for installing TopoStats depending on your usage\n\n1. [**Python Package Index**](https://pypi.org/) - appropriate if you are just using TopoStats and don't need to dig into\n   the code.\n2. Cloning the GitHub Repository - if you want to look at the code, contribute to it, debug errors or perhaps test a new\n   feature before a release.\n\n### PyPI Installation\n\nAfter activating your `topostats` Conda environment you can install TopoStats from PyPI using the following command.\n\n```bash\npip install topostats\n```\n\nThis will install TopoStats under your virtual environment and the command `topostats` will be available at the\ncommand line. It has a number of sub-commands which can be displayed by invoking it without any options. You can upgrade\n`topostats` by using the `--upgrade` flag...\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade topostats\n```\n\nYou can always install a specific version from PyPI\n\n```bash\npip install topostats==2.0.0\n```\n\nFor more information on using `pip` to install and manage packages please refer to the [pip\ndocumentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/).\n\n### Installing from GitHub\n\nYou may wish to consider cloning and installing TopoStats from GitHub if...\n\n- You wish to try out new features that have been developed since the last release (if you find problems please create\n  an [issue](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/issues)).\n- If you have found an issue in a released version and want to see if it has been fixed in the unreleased version.\n- If you wish to develop and extend TopoStats with new features yourself.\n\nThere are two options to install from GitHub, which you use will depend on what you want to do.\n\n1. Using PyPI to install directly.\n2. Clone the repository and install from there.\n\nIf all you want to do is use the development version of TopoStats then you can use option 1. If you wish to change the\nunderlying code you should use option 2.\n\n#### Installing from GitHub using PyPI\n\n[`pip`][pip] supports [installing packages from GitHub][pip_github]. To install the `main` branch of TopoStats use the\nfollowing in your Virtual Environment.\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats.git@main\n```\n\nYou can install any branch on GitHub by modifying the last argument (`@main`) to the branch you wish to install,\ne.g. `@another_branch` would install the `another_branch` (if it existed).\n\n#### Cloning the Repository and installing\n\nIf you do not have Git already installed please see [Git](installation#git). If you intend to contribute to the\ndevelopment of TopoStats please read through the [contributing](contributing) section.\n\nIf you are familiar with the command line then you can clone and install TopoStats with the following _after_ activating\nyour virtual environment. By installing in editable mode (with the `-e` flag) switching branches will make the branch\navailable.\n\n```bash\ncd ~/where/to/clone\ngit clone git@github.com:AFM-SPM/TopoStats.git\ncd TopoStats\npip install -e .\n```\n\nIf you plan to contribute to development by adding features or address an existing\n[issue](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/issues) please refer to the [contributing](contributing) section and pay\nparticular attention to the section about installing additional dependencies.\n\nWe include [notebooks](notebooks) which show how to use different aspects of TopoStats. If you wish to try these out the\n[Jupyter Noteooks](https://jupyter.org/) then you can install the dependencies that are required from the cloned\nTopoStats repository using...\n\n```bash\npip install \".[notebooks]\"\n```\n\n#### Cloning Using GitKraken\n\nIf you are using GitKraken you can clone the repository by selecting \"Clone\" and then \"GitHub.com\" and typing\n`TopoStats` into the box next to \"Repository to Clone\" and you should be presented with the option of selecting\n\"TopoStats\" from the AFM-SPM organisation. Once cloned follow the above instructions to install with `pip` under your\nvirtual environment.\n\n## Tests\n\nOne of the major changes in the refactoring is the introduction of unit tests. These require certain packages to be\ninstalled which are not installed to your virtual environment by\n[setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/setuptools.html) in the above steps. If you are intending to modify or\ncontribute to the development of TopoStats or make changes to the code base you will likely want to be able to run\nthe tests. Install the necessary dependencies to do so with...\n\n```bash\ncd TopoStats\ngit checkout dev\npip install \".[tests]\"\npytest\n```\n\n## Git\n\n[Git][git] is a version control system for managing software development and is required to be installed on\nyour computer in order to clone the TopoStats repository. Instructions on installing Git can be found at [Git Guides -\ninstall git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).\n\nA nice Graphical User Interface for working with Git is [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) which includes\neverything you need.\n\n[git]: https://git.vc\n[pip]: https://pypi.org/project/pip/\n[pip_github]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/#install-a-package-from-github\n"

Please do not hesitate to start a [discussion](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/discussions) or open a [new issue](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/issues/new/choose).\r\n\r\n## Notebooks\r\n\r\nWe also have a set of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/tree/main/notebooks) available from the GitHub repository. These take you through the steps in processing scans with TopoStats that run automatically, summarising the resulting statistics using Matplotlib, and plotting the scans which are now saved as Numpy arrays.\r\n\r\nWe are working on some Notebooks to run in Google Colab, for now though you can either save the Notebooks to your computer from GitHub and run them or [clone the TopoStats repository](https://afm-spm.github.io/TopoStats/main/installation.html#cloning-from-github) and run them from the `notebook` directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AFM-SPM/TopoStats/compare/v2.0.0...v2.1.0\r\n",

This will _not_ run any analyses.\n\n**NB** - This feature is only available in versions > v2.0.0 as it was introduced after v2.0.0 was released. In older\nversion > 2.0.0 and <= 2.1.2 you can use the older `run_topostats --create-config` option.\n\n```bash\nrun_topostats --create-config-file config.yaml\n```\n"
