        "value": "   This is for simplicity and flexibility, so it can be built into pipelines (eg using `samtools view`), as detailed above. \n   Again for flexibility; it is recommended you pipe into [`bgzip`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/bgzip.html) (block gzip tool that comes with [`tabix`](http://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) -- `sudo apt install tabix`) so that you can index and fast-access regions later (`tabix output.vcf.gz`). \n- **REscan expects paired-end, _position-sorted_ data** \n   The fundamentals of the REscan statistic rely on mapped reads with poorly-mapped mates, so you should use paired-end sequence data. It won't do anything useful with single-end data. \n   If you are only generating statistics for certain regions (eg specified using `-r`/`--regions`) then consider also only inputting data relevant to these regions from SAMtools. Bear in mind that for the edges of your regions you will also need SAM data +/- some distance (eg, say, 500 bases) so that you will accurately count reads orientated into your loci of interest. One sensible solution is `samtools view in.bam -L regions1.bed | rescan -r regions2.bed [...]`, where `regions2.bed` contains your regions of interest and `regions1.bed` contains those regions extended by +/- 500 bp. \n   The REscan statistic is very basic; REscan will not measure the repeat length, for example. For a more comprehensive tool, try ExpansionHunter or one of the many _punSTR_ programmes. \n   There are many ways to end up with poorly-mapped mates as defined by REscan (eg inversions, translocations, CNVs). This programme is called REscan because the original motivation to write it was to identify novel potential repeat expansions. A high statistic at a locus warrants further investigation and should not be considered as definitive evidence for a repeat expansion. You should follow up with other tools and wet-lab validation, if possible. \n- **If your data aren't human, you might need to tweak** \n   The longest chromosome length the algorithm can handle is defined in `functions.c` in the `BASELEN` macro (268,435,456, ie 2^28, at time of writing). This is long enough to fit human chromosome 1; if you are working with an organism with longer chromosomes you will need to change this number and recompile. \n- **Know your input data** \n   It is useful to know a bit about the provenance of your data and how it looks before you use this tool. For example, if you can find it out, it is useful to know the mean fragment length of DNA molecules used in library preparation, and to set `--distance` (`-d`) accordingly. You could also, of course, look at the fragment size distribution in your SAM data in advance to inform this decision. \n- **Know your output data** \n   Generating these statistics is just the beginning of an exploratory journey; you should look at your data and have a think about how you might clean them up (eg standardising within individuals) and, for interesting loci, cross-reference with structural variant callers. If you still suspect a repeat expansion, have a look at the reference genome for potential motifs.\n \n"
