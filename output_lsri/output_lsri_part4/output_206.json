RNAi is an essential part of the immune response to viruses and other foreign genetic material especially in plants but also in many fungal and animal species where it is a part of their innate immunity system. RNAi has become an important research tool for studying gene function by strong and selective suppression of the genes of interest also in large-scale screens. However, the application of RNAi as a technology raises important questions about efficiency and specificity of corresponding gene constructs. Since the RNAi machinery selects targets based on sequence similarity, there is an inherent risk of hitting non-targeted genes. Therefore a reliable search and prediction of off-targets is crucial for the practical application of RNAi. Besides being gene-specific, a successful RNAi construct should also be able to produce a strong silencing effect, which is highly depending on selecting an optimal sequence for design of the RNAi construct.\nHere, we report on a software called siFi for optimizing long double-stranded RNAi- target design and for prediction of RNAi off-targets. It is open source desktop software that provides an intuitive graphical user interface, works in Microsoft Windows environment and can use custom sequence databases in  standard FASTA format.  \n"
