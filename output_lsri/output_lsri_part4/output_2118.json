We present a novel method for targeting assembly of specific protein-coding genes using a graph structure combining both de Bruijn graphs and protein HMMs. The inclusion of HMM information guides the assembly, with concomitant gene annotation.  \nWe have been using Xander to assemble contigs for both phylogenetic marker gene and functional marker genes from soil metegenomic data ranging from 5 GB to 350 GB. We compared our method to a recently published bulk metagenome assembly method and a recently published gene-targeted assembler and found our method produced more, longer and higher-quality gene sequences. Xander can detect low-abundance genes and low-abundance organisms. HMMs can be tailored to the targeted genes, allowing flexibility to improve annotation over generic annotation pipelines. \n"

This is used to build for_enone.hmm and align contigs after assembly. Can be downloaded from FunGene.\n* framebot.fa: a large near full length known protein set for identifying start kmers and FrameBot nearest matching. More diversity is better, more sequences means more starting points (more computational time) but less susceptible to noise than model creation. Prefer near full-length and well-annotated sequences. Filter with Minimum HMM Coverage at least 80 (%).\n* nucl.fa: a large near full length known set used by UCHIME chimera check.\n\nThe gene ref directory must have three files for Xander assembly. A script in **bin/prepare_gene_ref.sh** is provided to build specialized forward and reverse HMMs using hmmer-3.0_xanderpatch, a modified version of HMMMER3.0. The modified version is tuned to detect close orthologs. Three output files will be written to the gene ref directory:\n* for_enone.hmm and rev_enone.hmm for the forward and reverse HMMs respectively. This is used to assemble gene contigs.\n* A ref_aligned.faa file containing a set of protein reference sequences aligned with for_enone.hmm. This is used to identify starting kmers. Need to manually examine the alignment using Jalview or alignment viewing tool to spot any badly aligned sequences. If found, it is likely there are no sequences in gene.seeds close these sequences. You need to valide these problem sequences to see they are from the gene you are interested, then either remoe them or add some representative sequences to gene.seeds and repeat the prepartion steps.\n\n\n**How to apply Xander patch to hmmer-3.0?**\n```\n* Download hmmer-3.0.tar.gz from ftp://selab.janelia.org/pub/software/hmmer3/3.0/\n* Unzip and untar hmmer-3.0.tar.gz, you will get a directory called hmmer-3.0.
