It also works around bugs in TopHat: \n- the \"mate is unmapped\" SAM flag is not set on any reads in the unmapped.bam file ([TopHat issue #3](https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/tophat/issues/3))\n- the mapped mate of an unmapped read can be absent from *accepted_hits.bam*, creating a mismatch between the file and the unmapped read's flags ([TopHat issue #16](https://github.com/DaehwanKimLab/tophat/issues/16)) \nThis software was developed as part of a PhD research project in the\n[laboratory of Lao H. Saal, Translational Oncogenomics Unit, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Lund University, Sweden](http://www.med.lu.se/saalgroup). \nA detailed description of the software can be found in [Brueffer and Saal (2016)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1058-x). \n"

TopHat sets it to 255 which some downstream tools don't like (even though it is a valid value according to the SAM specification). \n- If an unmapped read's paired read is mapped, set the following fields in the unmapped read (downstream tools like Picard AddOrReplaceReadGroups get confused by the values TopHat fills in for those fields):\n  * RNAME: RNAME of the paired read\n  * RNEXT: RNAME of the paired read\n  * POS:   POS of the paired read\n  * PNEXT: 0 \n- For unmapped reads with missing mapped mates, unset the mate-related flags to effectively make them unpaired.  The following flags are unset:\n  * 0x1  (mate is paired)\n  * 0x2  (mate in proper pair)\n  * 0x8  (mate is unmapped)\n  * 0x20 (mate is reversed)\n  * 0x40 (first in pair)\n  * 0x80 (second in pair) \nExamples of error messages emitted by downstream tools when trying to process unmapped reads without some or all of these\nmodifications can be found in [this thread in the SEQanswers forum](http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=28155),\nwhich lead to the development of this software. \n"
