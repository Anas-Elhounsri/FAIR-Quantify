It serves as an alternative to `scanpy.pp.neighbors()`, with both functions creating a neighbour graph for subsequent use in clustering, pseudotime and UMAP visualisation. The standard approach begins by identifying the k nearest neighbours for each individual cell across the entire data structure, with the candidates being subsequently transformed to exponentially related connectivities before serving as the basis for further analyses. If technical artifacts (be they because of differing data acquisition technologies, protocol alterations or even particularly severe operator effects) are present in the data, they will make it challenging to link corresponding cell types across different batches. \nAs such, BBKNN actively combats this effect by taking each cell and identifying a (smaller) k nearest neighbours in each batch separately, rather than the dataset as a whole. These nearest neighbours for each batch are then merged into a final neighbour list for the cell. This helps create connections between analogous cells in different batches without altering the counts or PCA space. \n"

It computes a batch aligned variant of the neighbourhood graph, with its uses within scanpy including clustering, diffusion map pseudotime inference and UMAP visualisation. The basic syntax to run BBKNN on scanpy's AnnData object (with PCA computed via `scanpy.tl.pca()`) is as follows:\n\n```python3\nimport bbknn\n\nbbknn.bbknn(adata)\n```\n\nYou can provide which `adata.obs` column to use for batch discrimination via the `batch_key` parameter. This defaults to `'batch'`, which is created by scanpy when you merge multiple AnnData objects (e.g. if you were to import multiple samples separately and then concatenate them).\n\nIntegration can be improved by using ridge regression on both a technical effect and a biological grouping prior to BBKNN, following a workflow from [Park _et al._, 2020](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6480/eaay3224.abstract). In the event of not having a biological grouping at hand, a coarse clustering obtained from a BBKNN-corrected graph can be used in its place.

The notebook also uses ridge regression to improve the integration.** \n\nThe [BBKNN paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz625) makes use of the following analyses:\n- [simulation.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/simulation.ipynb) applies BBKNN to simulated data with a known ground truth, and demonstrates the utility of graph trimming by introducing an unrelated cell population. This simulated data is then used to benchmark BBKNN against mnnCorrect, CCA, Scanorama and Harmony in [benchmark.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/benchmark.ipynb), and then finish off with a benchmarking of a BBKNN variant reluctant to work within R/reticulate and visualise the findings in  [benchmark2.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/benchmark2.ipynb). [benchmark3-new-R-methods.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/benchmark3-new-R-methods.ipynb) adds some newer R approaches to the benchmark.\n- [mouse.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/mouse.ipynb) runs a collection of murine atlases through BBKNN. [mouse-harmony.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Teichlab/bbknn/blob/master/examples/mouse-harmony.ipynb) applies Harmony to the same data.\n\nThe [BBKNN preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/22/397042) performed some additional analyses that got left out of the final manuscript.
