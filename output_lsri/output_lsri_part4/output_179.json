Smith\n2018-05-18\n\n-   [Installing R](#installing-r)\n-   [Installing Python](#installing-python)\n-   [Installing fastsimcoal2](#installing-fastsimcoal2)\n-   [Installing delimitR](#installing-delimitr)\n-   [References](#references)\n\nInstalling R\n============\n\nThis package requires R (&gt;=3.5.0). If you do not have R installed, or if you have an earlier version, install R 3.5.0 or later. Visit <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/> for installation instructions for MacOSx. For installation instructions for Windows, visit <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>.\n\nInstalling Python\n=================\n\nThough delimitR is written in R, it depends on Python to generate the binned Site Frequency Spectrum. Python scripts in this package were written in python 2.7.13.\n\nAdditionally, the python modules sortedcontainers and collections must be installed. This can be accomplished using pip or conda.\n\nPlease note that if you use conda to manage your python it is likely that the python version called from terminal does not match the python version called by a system command in R. To check this, in the terminal run:\n\n    python --version\n\nIn R, run:\n\n    system('python --version')\n\nIf these match, and if your python is python 2.x, then you should be okay. Otherwise, you'll need to provide a path to the correct python. Make sure this is python 2.x, and make sure that you have the sortedcontainers and collections modules installed. To change the python that R calls, run the code below, replacing \"/Users/msmith/anaconda2/bin\" with the path to the python version you wish to use.\n\n    Sys.setenv(PATH = paste(\"/Users/msmith/anaconda2/bin\", Sys.getenv(\"PATH\"), sep=\":\"))\n\nTo check that this worked:\n\n    system('python --version')\n\nInstalling fastsimcoal2\n=======================\n\nIn order to simulate data, delimitR uses fastsimcoal2 (Excoffier, 2013). To download fastsimcoal2, visit <http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal2/>, and follow the installation instructions. delimitR was built using fastsimcoal2 ver 2.6.0.3 - 14.10.17. If you're using a newer version of fastsimcoal2 and encounter issues, please contact me at <megansmth67@gmail.com>.\n\nInstalling delimitR\n===================\n\nIf you have R (&gt;=3.5.0) and python 2.x with sortedcontainers, then you're ready to install delimitR.\n\nTo install delimitR, you need to first install Hadley Wikham's devtools package:\n\n    install.packages('devtools', repos = \"http://cran.r-project.org\")\n\nDownload the delimitR source code, and unpack the tar.gz file. Set your working directory to the directory above the delimitR directory that was created when you unpacked the source code.\n\n    devtools::install('delimitR', dependencies = TRUE)\n\nNow, you're ready to run an analysis in delimitR!\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nExcoffier L, Dupanloup I, Huerta-Sanchez E, Sousa VC, Foll M (2013) Robust Demographic Inference from Genomic and SNP Data.
