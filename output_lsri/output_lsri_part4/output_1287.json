The development is now continued in the Omics IT and Data Management Core Facility (ODCF) at the DKFZ. \n> <table><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.denbi.de/\"><img src=\"docs/images/denbi.png\" alt=\"de.NBI logo\" width=\"300\" align=\"left\"></a></td><td><strong>Your opinion matters!</strong> The development of Roddy is supported by the <a href=\"https://www.denbi.de/\">German Network for Bioinformatic Infrastructure (de.NBI)</a>.
