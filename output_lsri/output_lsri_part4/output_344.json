        "value": "In order to show the functionalities of the IPA package we generated a syntheitc experiment.\nThis synthetic experiment contains 15 compounds involved in the mevalonate pathway and limonene synthesis.\nConsidering a positive ionisation, several adducts were simulated for each of the considered metabolites (M+H, M+Na,\nM+2H and 2M+H for positive mode). Additionally, all the possible isotopes with a predicted relative abundance\nhigher than 5% were included in the dataset. A realistic experimental outcome was simulated by adding Gaussian noise to the m/z values, where appropriate the standard deviation was computed for each mass assuming an instrument accuracy of 10 ppm. For each detected mass, the measured intensities were chosen in order to be coherent with the theoretical abundance of the isotopes, and the same RT value (+-2 seconds) was assigned to all the simulated masses related to the same compound. After loading the package, the synthetic experiment just described can be imported in the R environment using the following commands together with the additonal datasets needed:\n```\nlibrary(IPA)\ndata(\"SyntheticExperiment\")\ndata(\"isotopes\")\ndata(\"adducts\")\n\n```\nThe synthetic experiment was simulated considering positive ionisation and an instrument accuracy of 10 ppm:\n\n```\nionisation=\"positive\"\nppm=10\n\n```\n\nThe first step consist in finding all the possible hits in the database. This is obtained with find.hits() function:\n\n\n```\nHits <- find.hits(adducts.matrix= all_adducts_POS,\n                  dataset=SyntheticExperiment$df.POS, ppm.thr= 5*ppm,\n                  RTwin=60,relation.id = SyntheticExperiment$relation.id,\n                  isotopes=isotopes, \n                  iso.threshold=1)\n\n```\n\nThe output of this function can be used as input of the compute.Priors() function\nin order to evaluate the prior probabilities:\n\n```\nPrior <- compute.Priors(Hits=Hits, dataset=SyntheticExperiment$df.POS,\n                        pk=rep(1,nrow(Hits$all.formulas)),\n                        ppm=ppm,unknown.ppm = 3*ppm, pr.lim = 1e-15)\n\n```\nIn order to consider all the possible connections, it is necessary to build the connectivity matrices for adducts, isotopes and biochemical connections:\n\n```\n### building ADD matrix\nADD <- build.add.connenctivity.matrix(Prior=Prior,  DB=DB,\n                                      ionisation,fully.connected=FALSE)\n\n### building ISO matrix\nISO <- build.iso.connectivity.matrix(Prior=Prior, DB=DB, ratios=TRUE)\n\n### building BIO matrix\nBIO1 <- build.bio.connectivity.matrix(Prior=Prior, DB=DB,\n                                      ionisation,\n                                      connection.type=\"reactions\")\n\n```\nFinally, it is possible to compute the posterior probabilities using the IPAposteriors() function.\n\n```\nPost <- IPAposteriors(P=Prior,Iso = ISO, Add = ADD, Bio = BIO1,\n                               Int = as.numeric(SyntheticExperiment$df.POS[,3]), ratio.toll = 0.8,\n                               delta.iso = .1, delta.add = .1, delta.bio = 1,\n                               allsamp = T, no.its = 5000, burn = 1000,\n                               rel.id = SyntheticExperiment$relation.id)\n\n```\n\nIt might be necessary to organize the results in a more readable fashion.\nThis can be obtained with the ParseIPAresults() function:\n\n```\nFinal.res <- ParseIPAresults(Post, Prior,dataset =SyntheticExperiment$df.POS, DB = DB, IDs=SyntheticExperiment$IDs)\n```\n\nThis creates a list with the same length of the number of feature considered. Each element contains a summary of the results for the considered features.\n\nThe whole analysis can be also run with a single wrapper called simpleIPA\n\n```\nResults <- simpleIPA(dataset=SyntheticExperiment$df.POS,\n                     adducts.matrix=all_adducts_POS, DB=DB,\n                     ionisation=ionisation, ppm=ppm, ppm.thr=5*ppm,\n                     RTwin=60,isotopes=isotopes, iso.threshold=1,\n                     relation.id=SyntheticExperiment$relation.id,\n                     delta.bio = 1, delta.add = .1, delta.iso = .1,\n                     allsamp = TRUE, no.its = 5000, burn = 1000,\n                     IDs=SyntheticExperiment$IDs,\n                     unknown.ppm = 3*ppm, pr.lim = 1e-15,\n                     fully.connected = FALSE, ratios = TRUE,\n                     connection.type = \"reactions\",\n                     v = T, IT = 500)\n```\n"
