        "value": "In this approach, we define the combination of multiple gene set annotation as a new annotation. Consider two potentially overlapping gene set annotations, there are 4 possible combination of annotations depending on the presence and absence of a gene in each gene set, i.e.,\n\n```\n0 0  ---> 0\n0 1  ---> 1\n1 0  ---> 2\n1 1  ---> 3\n```\nFor example ``0 1`` denotes a gene annotated in the second gene set but not in the first set, and we denote this combination as category ``1`` in the combined annotation. \nMore generally, this specific input format should be used if every gene is annotated by one of K mutually exclusive categories. The summary statistics and annotation of the genes should be contained in a single text file. \nImportantly, we require that **the annotation for the baseline category is coded by 0**, other categories can be coded by arbitrary strings or integers.\n\nUnder this formulation, BAGSE allows that the effect size distribution under the alternative model (i.e., when gene-level association is genuine) is category-specific. \n\nNote, although this approach is the most general, it does not scale computationally for a large number of gene sets.  \n\n\nBAGSE prefers estimated association effect size (b-hat) and its corresponding standard error, se(b-hat), as the summary statistics for each gene. The information should be organized in a single text file with the following format\n\n``` \ngene-name  b-hat se(b-hat)  annotation\n```\n\nBAGSE also accepts gene-level z-scores as input. In such case, the expected format for the input text file is\n\n```\ngene-name  z-score  annotation\n```\nUse command option ``--load_zval`` to inform BAGSE that the z-score input is used. \n\nAdditionally, p-values can be used in place of z-scores when the command line option ``--load_pval`` is specified.\n"

The estimates of the other categories are the estimated log-odds ratios *relative to* the baseline level, i.e., representing the relative enrichment in comparison to the baseline level. \nFor example, in the above example, the absolute log-odds ratio for ``category_1`` can be computed by -0.973 + 0.841 = -0.132.\n+ The last two columns jointly represents the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated parameters.\n\n\n\nUnder the formulation of multiple gene set annotations assuming additivity, the output is similar.
