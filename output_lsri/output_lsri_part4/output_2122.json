        "value": "This section describes how to prepare the input files for RASQUAL. If you prefer, Kaur Alasoo has now developed a set of tools in Python that hopefully simplify the process of creating RASQUAL input files <a href=\"https://github.com/kauralasoo/rasqual/tree/master/rasqualTools\">here</a>.\nRASQUAL needs two input data files: \n1. A fragment (read) count table, with sample specific offsets (such as library size)\n2. A VCF file with \\*phased\\* SNP genotypes and allele-specific counts.  \n\nAn example of each of these files can be found in the data directory. In the usage example below, RASQUAL takes SNP information from a tabix-indexed VCF file as standard input, while the count table and sample specific offsets are binary files (Y.bin and K.bin, respectively). Tabix-indexing is not strictly necessary but allows for genotype and allelic count information to be accessed quickly from the command line.\nUsing the example data files, you can use the following commands to map expression QTLs for two genes (C11orf21 and TSPAN32) using RASQUAL: \n    # make sure tabix is installed in your environment\n    cd $RASQUALDIR\n    tabix data/chr11.gz 11:2315000-2340000 | bin/rasqual -y data/Y.bin -k data/K.bin -n 24 -j 1 -l 378 -m 62 \\\n        -s 2316875,2320655,2321750,2321914,2324112 -e 2319151,2320937,2321843,2323290,2324279 \\\n        -t -f C11orf21 -z\n    tabix data/chr11.gz 11:2315000-2340000 | bin/rasqual -y data/Y.bin -k data/K.bin -n 24 -j 2 -l 378 -m 60 \\\n        -s 2323227,2323938,2324640,2325337,2328175,2329966,2330551,2331219,2334884,2335715,2338574,2339093 \\\n        -e 2323452,2324188,2324711,2325434,2328220,2330040,2330740,2331248,2334985,2337897,2338755,2339430 \\\n        -t -f TSPAN32 -z \nSample size (in this example, *N*=24) is given by **-n** option and the feature ID is given by **-j** option.  Here only two genes exist in this example, thereby j=1, 2.  In reality, you may have e.g. >10,000 features in your data, of which you may want to map QTL e.g. for the 12,345th feature, you must set **-j 12345**.  You need to provide the number of testing SNPs and feature SNPs in the *cis*-window *a priori* (**-l** and **-m**, respectively).  RASQUAL also requires the feature start and end positions (as **comma separated values without space in ascending order** for more than one positions, e.g. such as for a union of exons in this example) as inputs (**-s** and **-e**, respectively).  By default, RASQUAL outputs QTL mapping results for all tested SNPs, but you can also specify only the lead QTL SNP (**-t** option).  In the output, you can also specify the feature name by **-f** option.  To take account of genotype uncertainty, imputation quality score (R square value) are used in this example (**-z** option; see the section below).  \n \n"

Cases where there is a very large change in genotypes between the prior and posterior should be treated with caution. \nAnother approach that you can use to detect these instances, is to stop updating posterior genotypes (**--no-posterior-update**) or use the nominal genotype 0, 1 and 2 (**--fix-genotype** option) and compare the Chi-square statistics with and without genotype correction. Cases where\nweakly significant QTLs become highly significant with genotype error correction should be treated with caution. \n    You may also use genotype likelihood (in Log10 scale) from conventional genotype imputation in conjunction with phased genotype data: \n    Likewise, you can also provide the genotype likelihood in nominal scale [0-1] with GP FORMAT: \n    Genotype dosage can also be utilised to take account of genotype uncertainty: \n    Imputation methods often provide a quality score for each SNP locus that approximates squared correlation coefficient between true and observed genotypes (*e.g.*, *R*^2 from MaCH or Beagle; *I*^2 from IMPUTE2 ).  RASQUAL can convert the score into genotyping error rate to handle uncertainly: \n    If genotype information is not available, RASQUAL can run in SNP free mode (**--population-allele-frequency** option).  In this case, you just need to provide the population allele frequency (not minor allele frequency!) for the SNP in VCF files.  Note that, this mode is only feasible when the causal SNP is a feature SNP (*e.g.*, ChIP-seq QTL). \nWe strongly recommend using the AP field for QTL mapping.  If there are multiple subfields of AP, GL and DS, AP is prioritised over both GL and DS, and GL is prioritised over DS.  If neither of GL, DS nor AP is provided, GL is used as AP.\n \n"
