This software has been described and validated in the manuscript `Needles: towards large-scale genomic prediction with marker-by-environment interaction`. (De Coninck et al., 2015, submitted to GENETICS) \n\nThis software was developed by Arne De Coninck and can only be used for research purposes. \nGenomic datasets used for genomic prediction are constantly growing due to the decreasing costs of genotyping and increasing interest in improving agronomic performance of animals and plants. To be able to deal with those large-scale datasets, a distributed-memory framework was developed based on a message passing interface the ScaLAPACK library and the PARDISO library for efficiently dealing with the sparse information introduced by the marker-by-environemnt interaction effects. The complexity of the algorithm is defined by the number of genetic markers and environments included in the genomic prediction setting; the number of individuals only has a linear effect on the read-in time. To enhance performance it is advised to compile and execute Needles on an MPI-optimized machine.\n \n"
