        "value": "A. General desription and purpose:\nCAT (Cosolvent Analysis Toolkit) is a platform for mixture cosolvent molecular dynamics simulations analysis,\ndeveloped by the Computational Medicinal Chemistry Group at Newcastle University, UK (2018). \nB. The workflow: \nCAT reads PDB frames from the trajectory generated\nusing GROMACS (or another MD simulation software)  and inputs the gromacs topology (topol.top) and the cosolvent\nmolecule itp file.\nUsing this, CAT is able to cluster and rank the regions with the highest \nprobability of being a allosteric binding site. \nC. Dependencies:\nSince CAT is a full standalone code, there are no special dependencies, and you can use any C++ compiler that suits you.\nWe used GNU C++ compiler - gcc - which is set automatically in the default Makefile\nWe recomend installation of Gromacs and acpype (both packages are free of charge)\nThere are no special hardware requirements. \nE. Usage:\n1- prepare your trajectory: remove PBC artefacts, strip waters, and save the trajectory in PDB format.\n \nThe instructions below use standard Gromacs tools. You may choose different software package, e.g. Amber or CHARMM.    \n1.1 - Remove any potential PBC artefacts (here with -pbc mol option) and strip waters\ngmx trjconv -s protein.tpr -f protein.xtc -o protein.gro -center -pbc mol \n1.2 - Fit your trajectory to remove rotational and translational degrees of freedom, saving all atoms, including hydrogens  \n2 - Select the list of all frames you want to analyse \nfor i in snapsCAT/protein*.pdb ; do echo $i >> list.dat ; dont \nF. Performance:\nThe time CAT requires to process the snapshots is directly related to the size of your trajectory, i.e. the number of snapshots/frames; on a standard Linux workstation, it typically takes 2 minutes for a 2000 frames trajectory \nG. Syntax and options\nA detailed guideline is provided in the CAT_tutorial, which gives in-depth intructions and a step-by-step explation of CAT. \nInput options\n-i : input list of structures generated in the step E.1.3\n-o : output file table with all the scores depth and data per residue\n-n : number of files in the list used in -i\n-t : protein topology generated in pdb2gmx (Gromacs)\n-s : cosolvent molecule itp (usually generated by acpype)\n-e : delta for smoothing the eletrostatic softcore potential -(if 0 is a hardcore potential)\n-v : delta for smoothing the VDW softcore potential -(if 0 is a hardcore potential)\n-c : the sphere radius to select interacting cosolvent molecules around each residue\n-g : clustering radius per-residue sphere \nall_clusters_top_spheres.pdb - the position of the clusters for the top-10 molecules\nall_contact.pdb - all the spheres regions surrounding each residue with the retention score\nall_spheres. pdb - all spheres per residue\naver_withB.pdb - average structure from the trajectory\nall_clusters.pdb - all possible clusters\noutput.dat - the table with all output values:\n\tele = electrostatic score\n\te_VAR = variance of electrostacit score\n\tvdw = Van der Waals score\n\tv_var = Van der Waals variance\n\tcount = arege number of molecues inside that residue sphere\n\tc_var = rmsd of the number of molecules inside that residue sphere \nH. Instructions for data reproduction\nSample input files and trajectory files are included in the CAT_tutorial directory\n \n"
