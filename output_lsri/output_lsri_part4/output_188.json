Use DeepPoseKit if you need: \n- tools for annotating images or video frames with user-defined keypoints\n- a straightforward but flexible data augmentation pipeline using the [imgaug package](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug)\n- a Keras-based interface for initializing, training, and evaluating pose estimation models\n- easy-to-use methods for saving and loading models and making predictions on new data \nDeepPoseKit is designed with a focus on *usability* and *extensibility*, as being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research. \nDeepPoseKit is currently limited to *individual pose estimation*. If individuals can be easily distinguished visually (i.e., they have differently colored bodies or are marked in some way), then multiple individuals can simply be labeled with separate keypoints (head1, tail1, head2, tail2, etc.). Otherwise DeepPoseKit can be extended to multiple individuals by first localizing, tracking, and cropping individuals with additional software such as [idtracker.ai](https://idtracker.ai/), [pinpoint](https://github.com/jgraving/pinpoint), or [Tracktor](https://github.com/vivekhsridhar/tracktor). \n"
