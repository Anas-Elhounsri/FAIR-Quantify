        "value": "Kourami is a graph-guided assembler for HLA haplotypes covering typing exons (exons 2 and 3 for Class I and exon 3 for Class II) \nusing high-coverage whole genome sequencing data. Kourami constructs highly accurate haplotype sequences at 1-bp resolution by \nfirst encoding currently available HLA allelic sequences from IPD-IMGT/HLA Database ( http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/ ) \nas partial-ordered graphs. Each database allele is naturally encoded as a path through the graph and any detectable genetic \nvariations (SNPs or indels) not captured by the known sequences are added to the graph by graph-modification based on read alignment \nto capture differences novel alleles have compared to known sequences. Unlike previously available WGS-based HLA typing methods \n(database-matching techniques), Kourami direclty assembles both haplotypes for each HLA gene (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DRB1).\nFrom version 0.9.4 or later, Kourami supports additional HLA loci.  It also provides the typing result (6-digit 'G' resolution) by\noutputing the best matching alleles among the known sequences whenever 'G' grouping information is available. \n"

Then you can compile using javac.\n  - To use Ant, you must have dependencies downloaded and place jars under 'exjars' directory. 'exjars' directory must be created.\n\n-A copy of the preformatted IMGT-HLA database (Kourami panel) can be obtained using a script. The panel sequence file needs to be bwa indexed before using and this is NOW done by the script when it downloads the database. The script will download and install the database under ```db``` directory under the Kourami installation directory. The download and index script can be run from the kourami installation directory:\n\n```\nscripts/download_panel.sh\n```\n\n[MAVEN USERS] To compile and generate a jar file run the following command from the kourami directory where pom.xml is located.\n```\nmvn install\n```\n\n[ANT USERS] To compile and generate a jar file run the following command from the kourami directory where build.xml is located.\n```\nant compile jar\n```\n\nThis will create a \"target\" directory and place a packaged jar file in it.\n"
