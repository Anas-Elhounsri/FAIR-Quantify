Lines in the logs file are:\n\n| Line number | Value | Explanation |\n|:---|:---|:---|\n| 1 | path_project_folder | Path to the project folder |              \n| 2 | project_folder | Name of project folder |                             \n| 3 | path_grid_file/grid_file | Path and name of docking grid file; write a random line if you do not use a grid |                  \n| 4 | path_morgan_folder/morgan_folder | Path to files containing the previously calculated QSAR descriptors (Morgan fingerprints)|           \n| 5 | path_smile_folder/smile_folder | Path to files containing SMILES of molecules |             \n| 6 | path_3dsdf_folder/3dsdf_folder | Path to precalculated 3D sdf conformations of molecules; write a random line if you do not have them |            \n| 7 | number_of_molecules_to_sample | Number of molecules sampled at each iteration. In the first iteration, this number of molecules will be split in three to form initial training, validation and testing, from the second iteration it will be the number of molecules added to the training set |\n\nDD pipeline is divided in 5 sequential phases to be repeated over multiple iterations until a desired number of final predicted virtual hits is reached:\n\n**Phase 1.** *Random sampling of molecules*\n1. The number of molecules to be sampled is defined in the logs.txt file and can be modified any time during the runs (for example, to keep constant the number of molecules added to the training set between iteration 1 and the other iterations). Choose the number according with the computational resources that are available (for the paper we sampled 3 million molecules for iteration 1 (so that can be divided into 1 million each for training, validation and test) and 1 million from iteration 2 onwards, all for training), as these molecules will be docked later on. During iteration 1 this sample of molecules will be splitted in three to build initial training, validation and test set. From iteration 2 it will correspond to the number of molecules that are used for augmenting the training set (so do not worry about the naming convention from iteration 2 onwards).\n2. Run phase 1\n    \n          bash pd_python/phase_1.sh iteration_no n_cpus path_to_log_file path_tensorflow_venv\n    \n3. This step will create few folders and files inside the *iteration* folder relative to your current iteration. First, it will create three *txt* files containing the names of molecules that were randomly sampled. Note that the name of these files will always start with train, valid and test, even after iteration 1 (when molecules are added only to the training set). Then, a *morgan* folder will be generated, containing three *csv* files with Morgan fingerprints for the sampled molecules. Finally, phase 1 will generate three *smi* files in a *smile* folder, with the SMILES of the sampled molecules, to be used as input for docking (phase 2). \n\n**Phase 2.** *Prepare molecules for docking*\\\nConvert SMILES from phase 1 to 3D sdf format for docking (if it is not done internally by the docking software). This step includes assigning tautomer and protonation states and generating conformers, and can be done with different free (e.g. [openbabel](https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Command-line_tools/babel.html)) or licensed programs (e.g. [omega](https://www.eyesopen.com/omega)).\n\n**Phase 3.** *Molecular docking*\n1. Run docking using the created sdf files\n2. From the docking results create three *csv* files with two columns, *ZINC_ID*, *r_i_docking_score* (use these exact headings):\n    - Populate the *ZINC_ID* column with the IDs of molecules (use the same heading even if you are not screening ZINC)\n    - Add the corresponding scores in the *r_i_docking_score* column\n3. Name the *csv* files as training_labels.txt, validation_labels.txt, testing_labels.txt, according with to the original *smi* file used to create files for docking. Follow this [format](temp/labels_example.txt)\n4. Put these files in the *iteration_no* folder\n\n**Phase 4.** *Neural network training*\n1. Training neural network models with different sets of hyperparameters (12 combinations of hyperparameter values will be evaluated). Activate the tensorflow environment and run\n     \n          python simple_job_models_noslurm.py -n_it iteration_no -mdd path_morgan_folder/morgan_folder -time training_time -protein project_folder_name -file_path path_to_project_folder -pdfp path_to_pd_python/pd_python -tfp path_tensorflow_venv -min_last minimum_molecules_at_last_iteration\n\n2. Training time should be set between 1 and 2 (hours)\n3. The minimum_molecules_at_last_iteration defines the number of top scoring molecules considered as virtual hits in the validation set during the last iteration. For example, setting this value to 100 for a validation set of 1 million molecules corresponds to consider the top 0.01% molecules as virtual hits, and so on. Default value is 200.\n4. Execute all the bash scripts in *path_project_folder/project_folder/iteration_no/simple_job*\n    \n**Phase 5.** *Selection of best model and prediction of the entire database*\n1. For chosing the best model run \n                 \n          python hyperparameter_result_evaluation.py -n_it iteration_no -protein project_folder_name -file_path path_project_folder -mdd path_morgan_folder/morgan_folder\n                \n2. Generate bash files for prediction:\n\n          python simple_job_predictions_noslurm.py -protein project_folder_name -file_path path_project_folder -n_it iteration_no -mdd path_morgan_folder/morgan_folder -pdfp path_to_pd_python/pd_python -tfp path_tensorflow_venv\n                \n3. Execute all the bash scripts in *path_project_folder/project_folder/iteration_no/simple_job_predictions*\n4. To check the number of molecules that are left after each iteration, sum the last column of the passed_file_ct.txt created in *path_project_folder/project_folder/iteration_no/morgan_1024_predictions*. You can compare this number with the number of left molecules predicted from the test set (total_pred_left) in *path_project_folder/project_folder/iteration_no/best_model_stats.txt*, and verify whether they are close.\n\nRepeat the above phases 1-5 for as many iterations as needed to reach a desired number of left molecules. You will just need to change the *iteration_no* value every time you start from phase 1 again (sometimes the number of molecules will plateu after a point i.e. the decrease will become very small after each iteration, at that point you can use the useful tip mentioned below).\n\n"
