        "value": "MToolBox is a highly automated bioinformatics pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mitochondrial DNA from high throughput sequencing data. MToolBox includes an updated computational strategy to assemble mitochondrial genomes from Whole Exome and/or Genome Sequencing (PMID: 22669646) and an improved fragment-classify tool (PMID:22139932) for haplogroup assignment, functional and prioritization analysis of mitochondrial variants. MToolBox provides pathogenicity scores, profiles of genome variability and disease-associations for mitochondrial variants. MToolBox provides also a Variant Call Format file (version 4.0) featuring, for the first time, allele-specific heteroplasmy.  \n  \nThe MToolBox pipeline includes: \n- an extended version of a previously published computational strategy for mtDNA genome assembly (PMID: 22669646). The pipeline has been integrated with the detection of insertions and deletions (indels) and the assessment of the heteroplasmic fraction (HF) and related confidence interval (CI) for each mt variant. HF and CI are integrated as genotype specific meta-information in a Variant Call Format (version 4.0) file;\n- the mt-classifier tool, for haplogroup prediction, mt variant functional annotation and prioritization. \n\nThe MToolBox development and manteinance relies on the work of undegraduates, PhD and Postdocs, which we would like to thank for their invaluable support:\n- [Claudia Calabrese](https://github.com/clody23)\n- [Domenico Simone](https://github.com/domenico-simone)\n- [Mariangela Diroma](https://github.com/ma-diroma)\n- [Roberto Preste](https://github.com/robertopreste)\n- [Rosanna Clima](https://github.com/Ros85)\n- Mariangela Santorsola\n- Ornella Vitale\n- Cristiano Gutta' (past)\n- Francesco Rubino (past) \nWe would also like to thank Professor Marcella Attimonelli (University of Bari), who inspired and supervises the MToolBox project. \n\n**As of September 2019** \nPlease check the changelog for more details. \n**As of April 2019** \nWe apologize for this inconvenient. \n**As of February 2019** \nA bug in the phylotree build 17 tree parsing has been fixed, causing replacement of `haplogroups.txt` and `phylotree_r17.pickle` files. The bug was causing wrong predictions mostly for X haplogroups. Please update your MToolBox installation with `git pull`. \n\n**As of April 2018**    \nUpdate to MToolBox v.1.1 \nUpdate of the [Sitevar nucleotide variability](http://www.hmtdb.uniba.it/siteVariability). The nucleotide variability of each variant site was estimated on the multi-alignment of 30,860 healthy genomes reported in [HmtDB](http://www.hmtdb.uniba.it/hmdb/). These genomes were derived from primary INSDC databases and individual submissions. Credits to [Rosanna Clima](https://github.com/Ros85) and Ornella Vitale.  \n**As of 24 October 2017**     \n\n**As of 11 December 2016** \nTo keep track of the **MToolBox updates** please visit [changelogs](https://github.com/mitoNGS/MToolBox/blob/master/changelog.md) and take a look at the MToolBox [latest releases](https://github.com/mitoNGS/MToolBox/releases). \n"

The bug caused heteroplasmic variants to be included in the consensus fasta sequence (generating many IUPAC ambiguity and incorrect haplogroup predictions).\r\n\r\n 3) Changes in the mapExome.py to remove reads that show a number of soft-clipped bases > 1/3 read length. This is to remove reads that show unique best alignments to mtDNA but still carry a small portion of the non-aligned read that can putatively map on nuclear homologous (NumtS) sequences.\r\n\r\n4) Strand-specific read depth has been added as a new feature to the VCF, under the new field SDP. This field reports the number of forward and reverse reads supporting the alternative allele, expressed as F;R, where F is the number of forward reads and R is the number of reverse reads.\r\n\r\n5) Additional options can be now specified in the configuration file (or default values will be considered).\r\n",
