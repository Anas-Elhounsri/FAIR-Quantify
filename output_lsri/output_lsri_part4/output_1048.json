Run MAPS pipeline for each replica before running it for merged dataset. That way, we will not need to map reads for merged dataset, but will use .bed/.bedpe files from each replica. It is crucial to add appropriate information about all biological replicas in the run_pipeline script. We show below how to do that.\n\nCopy MAPS/bin/run_pipeline.sh to MAPS/bin/run_pipeline_[PROJECT_NAME].sh, where [PROJECT_NAME] is the name of your set of biological replicas.\n\nIn run_pipeline_[PROJECT_NAME].sh set parameters:\n\n* python_path\n  * location of python (MAPS works with python3)\n* Rscript_path\n  * location of Rscript\n* feather\n  * 1 if you want to run feather part. 0 if not. You want this set to 0 if you have already ran feather for this dataset and need to run MAPS only. Otherwise set it to 1. If you are running MAPS on merged datasets, feather must be set to 1\n* maps\n  * 1 if you want to run MAPS past. 0 if not. By setting this to 0, you ran mapping and prefiltering (outputs are .bedpe and .bed files), but not binning or peak calling.\n* number_of_datasets\n  * Number of biological replicas. Can be 1,2, \u2026 N. If set to 1, script assumes that user is running MAPS for a particular biological replica. If number_of_datasets is larger than 1, script assumes that user is running MAPS on merged data, and it will look for .bedpe and .bed files of each replica defined in dataset1, dataset2,..., datasetN lines (See below)\n* dataset_name\n  * Name of dataset.\n* fastq_format\n  * Extension of .fastq files (usually .fastq, but can be .fa) Your fastq file names must be named [datast_name]_R1.fastq (or .fa) and [datast_name]_R2.fastq, where [dataset_name] is the name of your data set\n* fastq_dir\n  * Location of fastq files\n* outdir\n  * Location of MAPS output files\n* macs2_filepath\n  * Location of MACS2 peaks\n* organism\n  * either mm10, hg19 or hg38, depending on which chromosome you use. Important for genomic features file. Also selecting this defines the number of chromosomes (19 for mouse, 22 for human).\n* bwa_index\n  * index of bwa. Set to path to bwa indexed genome\n* bin_size\n  * resolution. Usually 5000 or 10000.  \n* binning_range\n  * binning range. How far 3D interactions can be called, also affects the estimate of the expected count. Default=1000000 Do not set to high value if data is sparse. Check MAPS paper for more details\n* filter_file\n  * Location of file with blacklisted bins. This is used if you want to exclude genomic regions from MAPS analysis. Reads mapping to those regions will be ignored. Set to \u201cNone\u201d if not blacklisting anything. A blacklist file is a tab delimited table containing two columns, named chr and bin, representing chromosome and the start location of bins that user wants to blacklist. For example:\n```\nchr\tbin\nchr1\t10000\nchr1\t15000\nchr13\t7000000\nchr15\t1300000\n```\n* generate_hic\n  * 1 if you want .hic file to be generated, 0 if not.\n* Dataset1, dataset2,...\n  * Used for running MAPS on merged dataset. When number_of_datasets > 1, run_pipeline looks at the paths defined by Dataset1, dataset2\u2026 to find  where each biological replica .bedpe and .bed files are.\n* model\n  * regression model. Can be pospoisson or negbinom. MAPS supports positive poisson (pospoisson) or negative binomial (negbinom) regression. Default value is pospoisson (positive poisson regression).\n* sex_chroms_to_process\n  * either X,Y,XY or NA. This specifies which (if any) sex chromosomes the user wants to run MAPS on: X = X chr only, Y = Y chr only, XY = both X and Y chroms, NA = none (just autosomal). Default value is NA.\n* bwa_index\n  * path to bwa indexed reference genome\n* fdr\n  * this is used for labeling purposes only. Do not change.

After successfully finishing setting described in MAPS pipeline setup, you will need to download data files:\n* 1D chip-seq peaks\n  * https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF686FLD/@@download/ENCFF686FLD.bed.gz\n* GSM2138324: HiChIP GM biological replicate 1 technical replicate 1 and technical replica 2 data:\n  * https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3467175\n  * https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3467176\n\nTo download HiChIP GM data from NCBI site, you will need NCBI SRA Toolkit, which can be downloaded here: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software Once you download and set up SRA Toolkit, to download .fastq files type:\n```\n./fastq-dump --split-files SRR3467175\n./fastq-dump --split-files SRR3467176\n```\nThis will download SRR3467175_1.fastq, SRR3467175_2.fastq, SRR3467176_1.fastq and SRR3467176_2.fastq files to your computer. Next, merge fastq files from technical replicas: \n```\ncat SRR3467175_1.fastq SRR3467176_1.fastq > GM12878_R1.fastq\ncat SRR3467175_2.fastq SRR3467176_2.fastq > GM12878_R2.fastq\n```\nThis is a proper way of merging fastq files from technical replicas becasue all duplicated reads will be removed during feather step of MAPS pipeline. We cannot merge biological replicas this way, since then we risk loosing some reads when removing duplicated. This is why, when we run MAPS on merged biologal replicas, we first need to run MAPS on each replica first, and then use mapped and filtered reads to call 3D interactions.\n\nrun run_pipeline_example.sh\n\nAfter you run this example, output should look like this:\nhttps://github.com/ijuric/MAPS/blob/master/examples/GM12878.5k.2.peaks.bedpe\n"
