The user should make sure that non-standard or modified amino acids (other than the 20 standard amino acids) are be replaced by their standard names in the PDB file before executing AR-PRED. Otherwise, AR-PRED will report error.\n\nAR-PRED has separate prediction models for active site and allosteric site residues in a given protein chain. Following are the commands and instructions to run predictions with AR-Pred.\n\n```\n$ARPRED_HOME/master_script.pl pdbfile  chain outputdir  pred_type activesite_file`\n\n-pdbfile: Name of the all-atom PDB file. Must be present inside the output directory.\n-chain: Name of the chain in the PDB file to make predictions for\n-outputdir: Name of the output directory. Must be created before running the master script.\n-pred_type: 1 for active site predictions and 2 for allosteric site predictions\n-activesite_file: Comma separated values (csv) file containing residue IDs in the PDB forming the active site. \n\t\nThe residue IDs must be separated by commas and must correspond to the residue IDs in the PDB file. The file name must include the path to the file.\n\nFor predicting active site residues change directory into the `outputdir` (`cd outputdir`) and run the following command.\n\n$ARPRED_HOME/master_script.pl pdbfile  chain outputdir  1\n\nFor predicting regulatory or allosteric site residues however, AR-PRED requires prior knowledge of active site residues. If you already know the residues which form the active site (or a part of the active site) in the chain of interest, then write the residue ids as comma separated values into a .csv (e.g., activesite_res.csv) file and pass the file as an argument to the master_script. In case of no prior knowledge of active site residues, the AR-PRED active site prediction tool or any other active site prediction software may be used. Use the following command to predict allosteric site residues.\n\n$ARPRED_HOME/master_script.pl pdbfile  chain outputdir  2 activesite_res.csv\n\nTip: When running the master script from the output directory, make sure to include the path alongwith the dir name in the `outputdir` argument.\n```\n"

Residues having higher scores are more likely to be active or allosteric site residues, depending upon the type of prediction made. \n\nNote: Depending on the database size and the number of sequences used for calculation of residue conservation scores and due to the random sampling of perturbation points for calculations of dynamic flexibility and perturbation response, there may be minor inconsistency in the residue ranking and scoring by AR-PRED in independent runs of the same protein. However, we have usually observed that the ranking of the top 50 highly probably active or allosteric site residues usually remain the same. To obtain more consistent results, it is advisable to get the average predictions from independent runs of AR-PRED.\n\nIn case of any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Sambit Mishra (skmishra@iastate.edu).
