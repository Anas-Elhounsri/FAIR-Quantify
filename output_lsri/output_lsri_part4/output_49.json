        "value": "# Contributing to spectrum_utils\n\n:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:\n\nThe following document provides guidelines for contributing to the documentation and the code of spectrum_utils. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\n**No contribution is too small!**\nEven fixing a simple typo in the documentation is immensely helpful.\n\n## Contributing to the documentation\n\nWe use [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate our documentation and deploy it to this site.\nMost of the pages on the site are created from simple text files written in markdown.\nThere are two exceptions to this:\n\n1. The API documentation is automatically generated from the documentation contained in the code.\n\n2. The vignettes are created from Jupyter notebooks.\n\n### Editing most documents\n\nThe easiest way to edit a document is by clicking the \"Edit on GitHub\" like in the top right hand corner of each page.\nYou'll be taken to GitHub where you can click on the pencil to edit the document.\n\nYou can then make your changes directly on GitHub.\nOnce you're finished, fill in a description of what you changed and click the \"Propose Changes\" button.\n\nAlternatively, these documents live in the `docs/src` directory of the repository and can be edited like code.\nSee [Contributing to the code](#contributing-to-the-code) below for more details on contributing this way.\n\n\n## Contributing to the code\n\nWe welcome contributions to the source code of spectrum_utils---particularly ones that address discussed [issues](https://github.com/bittremieux/spectrum_utils/issues).\n\nContributions to spectrum_utils follow a standard GitHub contribution workflow:\n\n1. Create your own fork of the spectrum_utils repository on GitHub.\n\n2. Clone your forked spectrum_utils repository to work on locally.\n\n3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name for your changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b fix_x\n    ```\n\n4. Make your changes (make sure to read below first).\n\n5. Add, commit, and push your changes to your forked repository.\n\n6. On the GitHub page for you forked repository, click \"Pull request\" to propose adding your changes to spectrum_utils.\n\n7. We'll review, discuss, and help you make any revisions that are required.\nIf all goes well, your changes will be added to spectrum_utils in the next release!\n\n\n### Python code style\n\nThe spectrum_utils project follows the [PEP 8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style.\nMore specifically, we use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to format and lint Python code in spectrum_utils.\n\nWe highly recommend setting up a pre-commit hook for black.\nThis will run black on all of the Python source files before the changes can be committed.\nBecause we run black for code linting as part of our tests, setting up this hook can save you from having to revise code formatting.\nTake the following steps to set up the pre-commit hook:\n\n1. Verify that black and pre-commit are installed.\nIf not, you can install them with pip or conda:\n\n    ```bash\n    # Using pip\n    pip install black pre-commit\n    \n    # Using conda\n    conda -c conda-forge black pre-commit\n    ```\n\n2. Navigate to your local copy of the spectrum_utils repository and activate the hook:\n\n    ```bash\n    pre-commit install\n    ```\n\nOne the hook is installed, black will be run before any commit is made.\nIf a file is changed by black, then you need to `git add` the file again before finished the commit.\n \n"

        "description": "# 0.4.0 - 2022-10-06\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n- Load spectra directly from online resources (ProteomeXchange members, metabolomics resources through GNPS) using the [Universal Spectrum Identifier](https://www.psidev.info/usi) mechanism.\r\n- Full support of the [ProForma 2.0](https://www.psidev.info/proforma) standard based on a formal context-free grammar.\r\n- Retrieve controlled vocabularies used by ProForma from their online sources and (cross-platform) cache locally.\r\n- Annotate different ion types: peptide fragments, internal fragment ions, immonium ions, intact precursor ions.\r\n- Annotate spectrum peaks that include a neutral loss.\r\n- Recommend installing [pyteomics.cythonize](https://pypi.org/project/pyteomics.cythonize/) for faster mass calculations.\r\n- Automatic code style enforcement using [black](https://github.com/psf/black).\r\n- Added contributing guidelines.\r\n- Added code of conduct.\r\n- Added .gitignore.\r\n- Minimum supported Python version bumped to Python 3.8.\r\n- Maximum supported Python version extended to Python 3.10.\r\n\r\n## Changed\r\n\r\n- Annotate spectrum peaks based on the [ProForma 2.0 specification](https://www.psidev.info/proforma) to described (modified) peptides.\r\n- Use `jitclass` instead of multiple `jit` functions to group the Numba spectrum processing functionality.\r\n- Use [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) instead of recommonmark to generate the documentation from MarkDown files.\r\n- Update runtime benchmark to the latest versions of all libraries.\r\n\r\n## Removed\r\n\r\n- `annotate_molecule_fragment` function to annotate peaks with a molecule string.\r\n- `annotate_mz_fragment` function to annotate peaks with their m/z values. Use the ProForma interface instead.\r\n- Global interface to set a static modification; specify modifications using ProForma directly instead.\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n- Don't crash when plotting empty spectra.\r\n- Use the correct 13C mass difference for isotope precursor removal.",
