This means that there will be four possible combinations - forward-forward, forward-reverse, reverse-forward and reverse-reverse depending on the orientation of the first and second read pairs respectively. The ProximityDetector output files report the strand combination in the format a_b_c_d, where a gives the number of forward-forward read pair combinations,  b gives the number of forward-reverse, c the reverse-forward and d the reverse-reverse. The sum of a, b, c and d is equal to the total number of supporting pairs, which is also reported separately. The strand combination information may reveal information on how constrained the chromosome conformation is at that location.\n        "
