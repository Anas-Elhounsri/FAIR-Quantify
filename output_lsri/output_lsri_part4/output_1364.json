        "value": "**Digestion**  \n*In silico* digestion is not performed in the same way as it is in a typical database search engine. Instead of having hard cut-offs for the maximum number of missed cleavages and minimum number of enzymatic termini, *GroundTruthSimulator* calculates the probability of each peptide's existence based on each enzyme's probability of cleavage. For a particular peptide, the probability of its existence from a single copy of a protein =(1 - ( PROB(no cleavage at n-term)) * (1-PROB(no cleavage at c-term)) * PRODUCT_over_all_missed_cleavages(PROB(cleavage)) ). To determine the number of copies that will exist of this peptide, we multiply the final digestion probability by the protein abundance.  \n**Post-translational modifications**  \nSimilarly to digestion, *GroundTruthSimulator* does not have hard cut-offs for the maximum number of dynamic modifications. Even the idea of dynamic vs static modifications is not used. Each modification has a user-defined probability of occupying a particular site (e.g. there are probably serines that are *never* phosphorylated), and a user-defined percentage of that residue that will be modified (e.g. if a particular serine *is* chosen to be phosphorylated, maybe only 1% of it ever exists in that form at any given time). A \"static\" modification can be simulated by setting both values to 100%. Candidate modification sites are first randomly assigned to each protein based on each PTM's probability of occupying a particular site. For each peptide created during the digestion process, modification combinations are created and their probability existing from a single protein is calculated. Combinations with low abundance are pruned.  The probability of a particular modification combination = PRODUCT_over_all_modification_states(PROB(modification state)). The probability of the modification state being \"no modification\" for a specific peptide's residue is 1 - SUM_over_all_modifications(PROB(modification)).  \n**Retention time**  \nDetermined via the BioLCCC library (http://pythonhosted.org/pyteomics.biolccc/)  \n**Elution shape**  \nThe shape of an ion's elution profile is modeled by an Exponential Gaussian Hybrid (EGH) function as described in \u201cA Hybrid of Exponential and Gaussian Functions as a Model of Asymmetric Chromatographic Peaks\u201d, by Kevin Lan and James W. Jorgenson, Journal of Chromatography, Part A, 915, 1-13 (2001).  \n**Ionization efficiency**  \nThe probability of a peptide ionizing is sampled from a uniform random distribution between 0 and 1.  \n**Charge state distribution**  \nThe probability a peptide is has a charge of k is equal to a binomial distribution with n = the number of basic residues + 1 (for the n-terminus) and probability of success p = .7 + uniform_random(0,0.3).  \n**Isotopic distribution**  \nAn ion's isotopic distribution is determined with the libmercury++ library based on Rockwood, A.L. and Haimi, P.: \"Efficent calculation of Accurate Masses of Isotopic Peaks\", Journal of The American Society for Mass Spectrometry. JASMS 03-2263, 2006.  \n**Ion abundance**  \nWe assume that digestion, modifications, ionization efficiency, charge, and isotopic distributions are all independent of each other. Therefore, an ion with charge z and isotope m has total abundance = Protein abundance x prob(digestion) x prob(PTMs) x prob(ionization efficiency) x prob(charge state = z) x prob(isotope = m)   \nIf at any point in the simulation, the abundance gets below the filter threshold set in ground_truth.conf, then it is filtered and not included in the latter stages of the simulator. \n"

This models the scan time for a QExactive-like instrument.  \n**Raw signals**  \nThe Cauchy-Lorentz distribution is used to model the peak shape for each ion. The raw signal is a mixture of these distributions and therefore the intensity at each m/z is equal to the sum of the contribution from each ion's distribution. These signals are then centroided. A dynamic range cut-off is applied by removing all peaks whose signal intensity is less than the intensity of the base peak (most intense peak) divided by the user-specific dynamic range. \n"

Scan time and ion abundance are computed identically as an MS1 scan.  \n**Sequence determination**  \nFirst, the precursor ion fraction (PIF) is calculated for each peptide in the scan. The PIF of a peptide is defined as the sum of ion intensities for all ions of that peptide (i.e. the sum of all isotope intensities for that peptide) divided by the total ion intensity of the scan. Next, a peptide is randomly selected from these peptides - weighted by their PIF. If the peptide is in the peptide database used to simulate a database search, and within the user-defined mass tolerance, then the peptide-spectrum-match (PSM) sequence is set to this peptide. Otherwise, we randomly (uniformly) choose a sequence from the peptides in the database search (including reverse decoys) that are within our mass tolerance of the targeted precursor m/z.  \n**Probability determination**  \n If the PSM sequence was mapped to a peptide in the scan, then the PSM probability is set to that peptide's PIF. Otherwise, the PSM probability is sampled from a truncated exponential distribution between 0 and 1. This null distribution's lambda parameter is set by the user in the configuration file. Reasonable defaults for all parameters are provided.   \n"

An example configuration file is found in the root directory: *ground_truth.conf*. This program outputs the ground truth data necessary for acquisition simulation. It models post-translational modifications (PTMs), digestion, chromatographic separation, electrospray ionization, and isotopic distributions.\n\n```ShellSession\n$ ./GroundTruthSimulator --help\n\nUSAGE: GroundTruthSimulator [options] input.fasta\n\nOptions:\n  --help                                Print usage and exit.\n  -c [ --config ] arg (=ground_truth.conf)\n                                        Input path to config file.\n  -o [ --ground_truth_out_path ] arg (=ground_truth.tab)\n                                        Output path for ground truth file.\n\n```\n\n*AcquisitionSimulator* takes as input the ground truth file from *GroundTruthSimulator* and a configuration file. An example configuration file is found in the root directory: *acquisition.conf*. One of the parameters in the config file is the path to the FASTA file used to simulate a database search, **make sure to edit this to a path on your computer!** This program simulates a user selected data-dependent acquisition algorithm on the ground truth data. It models chromatographic elution shape, ion accumulation, MS1 spectra, scan time durations, and database search peptide-spectrum-matches (PSMs). It currently does not simulate MS2 fragmentation spectra. The output includes an mzML file, a .fido file, and a targetDecoy.txt file. The .fido file includes all PSMs in the format required for Fido to perform protein inference, and the targetDecoy.txt file contains the list of forward and decoy protein names used for the FidoChooseParameters program. Fido is available here: http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/fido/\n\n```ShellSession\n$ ./AcquisitionSimulator --help\n\nUSAGE: AcquisitionSimulator [options] ground_truth.tab\n\nOptions:\n  --help                                Print usage and exit.\n  -c [ --conf ] arg (=acquisition.conf) Input path to config file.\n  -o [ --mzml_out_path ] arg (=sample.mzML)\n                                        output path for mzML file.\n  -f [ --fido_out_path ] arg (=sample.fido)\n                                        output path for fido file.\n``` \n**Example**\n\nYou can download UniProt's human proteome <a href=\"http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=proteome:UP000005640\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.
