The package is called DEA (Differential Expression analysis with *Annocript*). It currently uses edgeR (Robinson *et al*, 2010) starting from the raw counts table. You can find it at https://github.com/frankMusacchia/DEA. \nIn the annocript_utils section you can also find a useful Python script for intelligent search of specific words inside user-selectable columns of the *Annocript* output. Other useful plots and analyses are in work in progress and will be made available as soon as possible. \nThis is a very simple guide, it is big only because everything is explained step-by-step but we promise that,\n after you installed and ran once, you will do it very rapidly the following times and you will never stop using it!\nWe strongly suggest to keep open this guide while you are installing and running *Annocript* for the first time. \nPlease cite: *Musacchia F, Basu S, Petrosino G, Salvemini M, Sanges R.

All of them may be safely downloaded using the Ubuntu Software Center (or other similar tools in different Linux releases). If you use this kind of tools you can simply search each package with its name and install it.\nThe supplementary Perl MODULES may be not included in the default installation, thus install them manually.\n \n  - MySQL database server (tested with ver5.5) (http://www.mysql.com/)\n  - MySQL database client with an account (tested with ver5.5) (http://www.mysql.com/)\n  - Perl (tested with ver5.10) (http://www.perl.org/get.html) ;\n  - BioPerl: (tested with ver1.6) (http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl); \n  - Python: (tested with ver2.7.3) (http://www.python.org/download/); \n  - R: (tested with ver3.2.5) (http://www.r-project.org/). \n    \n  - Supplementary Perl MODULES: readkey.pm, Parallel/ForkManager.pm, Switch.pm\n    To install them on a Debian derivate linux distribution use from a terminal: \n    - sudo apt-get install libterm-readkey-perl \n    - sudo apt-get install libparallel-forkmanager-perl \n    \n    You may want to use the following Linux commands to check if you already have these perl modules:\n\t- perl -MParallel::ForkManager -e \"print \\\"Module installed.\\\\n\\\";\"\n\t- perl -MTerm::ReadKey -e \"print \\\"Module installed.\\\\n\\\";\"\n\n**Do not need sudo permissions**\n\nBLAST, CPC2 and DNA2PEP can be installed automatically by the script install.pl. But if for some reason you can't. Follow here. \nThe tested versions are in bracket. Different versions may not work with this *Annocript* version.\nDownload them at: \n- blast+ : ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/ (tested with ver2.7.1+)\n- CPC2: http://cpc2.cbi.pku.edu.cn/download.php (tested with ver2.0beta)\n  libsvm-3.18 and biopython are needed to install CPC2. Please follow the instructions contained into the README file inside the package.\n- dna2pep: (tested with ver1.1) (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/VirtualRibosome/download.php)\n\n## Instructions to manually install BLAST, CPC2 and DNA2PEP \n\n\nTo install please execute the following steps. Start copying both in the bin directory just created. \n\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco$ cp Annocript/DL_PROGRAMS/CPC2-beta.tar.gz bin \n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco$ cp Annocript/DL_PROGRAMS/dna2pep-1.1.tar.gz bin \n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco$ cd bin \n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n\nTWO THINGS TO REMEMBER!! \n  1. We provide up-to-date versions of CPC2 and dna2pep into the folder DL\\_PROGRAMS.  dna2pep comes with a link to Python that is incorrect. We adjusted it in the corresponding dna2pep.py script but please remember this fact if you get an error. Look inside the DL_PROGRAMS folder to find both. We suggest to install BLAST+, CPC2 and dna2pep in a common bin directory of your file system (/home/francesco/bin). \n\n  2. BLAST programs and DNA2PEP don't need to be installed for Annocript as it uses full paths to access the executables. If you plan to use BLAST programs later you can choose a manual installation. Instead you will need to install CPC2 and its dependency. \n\n### CPC2 installation \n\n\nCPC2 makes use of biopython and libsvm. Please follow the instructions into the README file to install it. The installation is straightforward.\n\n\n### dna2pep Installation \n\nIt don't need to be installed, only uncompress in the bin folder you created. Here we will also change \npermissions of the .py file or *Annocript* will not find it. \n \n(If you don't use the version included in *Annocript*, please modify the first row of the dna2pep.py with the correct path for Python (i.e. /usr/bin/python)) \n\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco$ cd bin \n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco/bin$ tar -zxvf dna2pep-1.1.tar.gz \n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco$ cd dna2pep-1.1\n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco/dna2pepp-1.1$ chmod 755 dna2pep.py \n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n\nIf you have any problems during the installation please see the FAQ page of the user guide or ask on the google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/annocript \n\n\n### NCBI-BLAST Installation \n              \n\nYou can both uncompress the archive compiled for your architecture and put it in the /bin folder or follow the NCBI instructions for the installation. \n\nOnce you downloaded the file from the NCBI website you have only to unpack the tar file in the bin folder:\n\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n              frank@compaq2:~/francesco/bin$ tar -zxvf ncbi-blast-2.2.27+-x64-linux.tar.gz\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n\nIn Ubuntu Linux you can also install it via terminal: \n\n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n              sudo apt-get install ncbi-blast+ \n              ---------------- TERMINAL ------------------ \n\n\nIf you have any problems during the installation please see the FAQ page of the user guide or ask on the google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/annocript \n\n\n\nTo see how to use the first time Annocript go to [TUTORIAL](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/Annocript/blob/master/GUIDE/TUTORIAL.md) page\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you get some error during the installation or the running of *Annocript* please see the FAQ page of the user guide or ask on the google group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/annocript\n"

        "description": "1.1 Release Candidate\n- Corrected a behavior of Annocript. Before it was possible to use a different database in the same session that was generating problems. Now, Annocript can see which database was used before and use that for all the successive analyses.\n- Solved a problem with pathway descriptions that sometimes have a dot at the end of the string. This dot were coming out in the final plots.\n- added a check of the fasta file to alert the user whenever it is found a sequence with length zero.\n- Modified the source to take the IUPAC allowed characters. Now it is from the ncbi website: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/blastcgihelp.shtml. Moreover, now Annocript let the user to choose to continue if some problem is found.\n- Reduced the computational time by inserting the possibility to not use the GFF output.\n- Added the column OSNameSP and OSNameUf/OSNameTR. Now each result contains its own organism while the GO terms are assigned to the best result between SwissProt and TrEMBL/UniRef. Moreover two plots will be generated for both of the closer organisms table.\n- Some statistics are added in the HTML page: number of results in SwissProt, UniRef/TrEMBL, CDD and SILVA databases.\n- Pathways columns modified. Now if more patwhays are assigned to a transcript there is no confusion of which of them may not have the second or a the third level. If a level is not present I print a '-' so that the list of level of different pathways is reconducible to the exact one. Before if two pathways were assigned to the same transcript, the level were mixed and there was no possibility to link the level to the pathway. (e.g. pwl1_1]---[pwl1_2; - ]---[ pwl2_2 means that the first pathway associated does not contains a 2nd level description). In order to also get a good statistic, I modified also the method with which Annocript counts the occurrences of pathways. \n- GO terms for domains columns modified.  Before we were separating all the GO terms assigned to a certain domain with a ';' and the groups with ']---['. But this separation could lead to redundant GO terms in the same column. Now for each transcript the GO columns contain all the GO terms separated by ']---[' and there is no distinction among domains and no redundance. The latter is important for the statistics using the table.\n- Substituted a system command, used during the database generation (cut), with PERL code. This command was causing an huge usage of memory on some system that caused the kill of the process.\n",

        "description": "We release the version 1.0 of Annocript after about 2 months of usage. Several modifies are coming from personal running and hints received from the google group.\n\nMain modifies\n- Corrected an error that obstructed the database schema import when a remote host is used\n- Removed the customized database of ribosomal ncRNAs. Now two databases from SILVA are concatenated and used:\n  ftp://ftp.arb-silva.de/current/Exports/SILVA_119_LSUParc_tax_silva.fasta.gz\n  ftp://ftp.arb-silva.de/current/Exports/SILVA_119_SSUParc_tax_silva.fasta.gz\n- Added a check on the Fasta file given in input. These conditions must be respected or the program will stop: 1. the transcript name immediately after '>'; 2. each row must have a maximum of 80 characters; 3. only IUPAC characters are allowed.\n- Added the code to use blast separately for SwissProt and TrEMBL/UniRef\n- Removed the usage of ColorBrewer which were causing a problem on some machines. Inserted a simpler color schema for plots.\n- Corrected an error which were causing Annocript to not use the output of Portrait if this latter stops stochastically.\n- Added the possibility to display piechart in alternative to barplots in the HTML output.\n",
