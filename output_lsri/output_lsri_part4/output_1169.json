Now, a dataset with half million markers and half million individuals can be analyzed within an hour, compared with days by using FarmCPU.

The executable program of BLINK, help documents, demonstration data, and tutorials are freely available here.\n\nThe latest executable file of BLINK beta version can always be found at https://github.com/Oliver-111/blink\n\nYou can find the R version here: https://github.com/YaoZhou89/BLINK\n\nPublication and citation can be found here: https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/2/giy154/5238723\n"
