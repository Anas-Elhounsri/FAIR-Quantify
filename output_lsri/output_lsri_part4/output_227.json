This is achieved by checking GL/GP/PL/GT fields in the VCF file, while only one in order will be used if existed.\n   \n   d) This step could be memory consuming, if the number of SNVs and/or cells are high. As a guideline, building matrices for 60,000 SNVs and 10,000 cells might need more than 30GB RAM to run, please allow enough RAM resource for running the script.\n   \n   e) Typical runtime for this step is about one hour, depending on the nature of the data and the resources being allocated.\n   \n   f) Typical number of filtered SNVs after this step is usually between 10,000 and 30,000.\n   \n   g) If this step fails, please check: 1) is your barcode tag in the BAM files \"CB\" - if not, you need to specify it using -t/--tag; 2) are you working on a mixed sample VCF rather than a simple merge of individual genotypes? 3) is the correct whitelist barcode file being used? The whitelist should be the trusted barcodes from your sequencing result, not the whole barcode library of the sequencing protocol.\n \n"

As a guideline, a matrix with 60,000 SNVs and 10,000 cells might need more than 50GB RAM to run, please allow enough RAM resource for running the script.\n   \n   f) Typical runtime for this step is about half an hour, with default parameters, depending on the nature of the data and the resources being allocated.\n   \n   g) scSplit will add one pseudo cluster to represent doublets.\n \n"
