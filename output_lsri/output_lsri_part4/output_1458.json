The resulting VCF file can be coordinate lifted and all samples can be clustered together based on reciprocal overlap.  The output includes for every FusorSV call the caller identifier and the specific call from that caller ids input VCF that contributed to the call in addition to an expectation estimate given the prior expectations on the agreement in that call.  Prior expectations are derived by using an alternate training mode that requires a true callset be given for each training observation that is used. <br>  \n![Alt text](images/fusorSV_overview_v3_crop.jpg?raw=true \"SVE\") <br>\n*logo and illustrations courtesy of Jane Cha <br>\n \n"

For diagnostic purposes and reporting, these values are kept and tabulated in the FusorSV/visual folder.\n\n-E or --stage_exclude_list is used to filter out calls made by a particuliar caller id.  For example if you have VCF files for caller id 4,9,10,11,17 but only want 4,9,17 you would use: -E 10,11 to exclude caller id 10 and 11 from training or application. The default exclude is 1,13,36.\n\n-M or --cluster_overlap is used to apply optional clustering of the resulting individual per sample FusorSV VCF file, where a decimal is given r = [0.0,1.0] that is used to cluster those calls that have >= r amount of reciprocal overlap. In the resulting clustered VCF file: all_samples_genotypes.vcf each individual call still reports the SV caller that contributed, but now they are aggregated across the samples by the SV caller id.\n\n-L or liftover is used to take the final call and apply a liftover criteria.  This uses the crossmap tool written by Liguo Wang http://crossmap.sourceforge.net with modifications to mapped versus unmapped criteria. DEFAULT option does a h19 to Hg38 liftover and will mark those calls that have a 1:1 mapping from hg19 to Hg38 in a new VCF file marked all_sampes_genotypes.mapped.vcf, while those calls that either have a 1:0 mapping meaning that the coordinate in hg19 is missing in Hg38, or when a coordinate in hg19 now has multiple coordinate regions in Hg38 as all_samples_genotypes.unmapped.vcf. Chain files can be obtained from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html \n\n-c or --chroms is a comma separated list that can be used to constrict the sequences used for analysis such as 1,2,3 ect\n\n-p or --cpus is used to run more than one cpu or core during training.  This value is passed to 1/2 that number during the VCF generation phase allowing very large number of samples to be processed at the expense of a longer runtime.\n"
