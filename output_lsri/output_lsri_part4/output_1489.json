Each item in the associated pathway column of the table is an embedded url that will take the user to the pathway map on KEGG. Genes on the pathway map that were present in the original input file's genome assembly will be displayed in green. Meanwhile, the target gene is displayed in red to be easily distinguishable.  \nAn example output file can be found in the gene_annotation_easy_viewer folder. It was produced using the example input file, choosing not to apply any filters, and choosing to display both genes and pathway tables.\n"

This is useful if users need to annotate distinct lists of genes of interests (ex. overexpressed and underexpressed genes). It is complete with UI that can be accessed from the first menu by selecting option 5. Requires a dat file from a previous GAEV run to function. This function takes lists of user defined gene ids (gene ids must match with the GAEV dat file) with each gene seperated by new lines. Each list of genes can be colored with a different hue. Common colors can be specified with the color name (ex. \"red\") or or with hex codes (ex. \"#FF0000\"). Output is an HTML file with a hyperlink to each pathway similar to the standard GAEV output. Example input and output files for this function have been included [here](https://github.com/UtaDaphniaLab/Gene_Annotation_Easy_Viewer/tree/master/gene_annotation_easy_viewer/Color%20Pathways%20Example%20Inputs%20Outputs).\n"
