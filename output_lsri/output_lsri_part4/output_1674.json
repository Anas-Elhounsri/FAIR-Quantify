It consists of a Bash shell script that executes several bioinformatics software programs in a Linux environment. This pipeline requires a reference genome and is compatible with both single- and paired-end Illumina reads. It implements the same well-tested tools commonly adopted in whole-genome sequencing.\r\n\r\nGB-eaSy is appropriate for users without extensive command-line expertise as well as for experienced bioinformaticians who may choose to modify any step of the script. Before starting the pipeline, the user modifies a parameters file with settings customized for their GBS project (e.g. path to raw sequencer output file, path to barcodes file, number of CPU cores to use). The user then issues a single command to execute the pipeline. \r\n\r"

You may need to set up an account before downloading.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#Log in to JGI\r\n#Replace USER_NAME with your user name\r\n#Replace USER_PASSWORD with your password\r\ncurl 'https://signon.jgi.doe.gov/signon/create' --data-urlencode 'login=USER_NAME' --data-urlencode 'password=USER_PASSWORD' -c cookies\r\n\r\n#Create directory for reference genome\r\nmkdir reference_genome\r\n\r\n#Download reference genome\r\ncurl 'https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/ext-api/downloads/get_tape_file?blocking=true&url=/Phytozome/download/_JAMO/56981cf70d87851ee9727dcb/Gmax_275_v2.0.fa.gz' -b cookies > ./reference_genome/Gmax_275_v2.0.fa.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: If unable to download the reference genome via the command line, go to https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/pages/dynamicOrganismDownload.jsf?organism=Gmax and select Gmax --> Wm82.a2.v1 --> assembly --> Gmax_275_v2.0.fa.gz \r\n\r\n**Step 4: Unzip and index the reference genome** \r\n\r\n```\r\n#Unzip\r\ngunzip reference_genome/Gmax_275_v2.0.fa.gz\r\n\r\n#Index\r\nbwa index reference_genome/Gmax_275_v2.0.fa\r\n```\r\n**Step 5: Modify the GB-easy_parameters.txt file if necessary**  \r\nThe variables in the parameter file are set by default to work with this tutorial and the sample data. For this tutorial, the variable *GBSX* points to the GBSX_DW.jar script, which we modified from the original GBSX.jar to include the HindIII cut site, which was not supported initially. Because the sample dataset in this tutorial uses the HindIII enzyme, this modified version of the GBSX script is required here.\r\n\r\n**Step 6: Run GB-eaSy**\r\n\r\n```\r\nsh ./GB-eaSy.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, to run the pipeline in the background with no hangups:\r\n```\r\nnohup ./GB-eaSy.sh &\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput: At the conclusion of the run, there will be two files in the Results directory: all_SNPS_raw.vcf (containing 4255 SNPs) and all_SNPs_minDP2.vcf (containing 238 SNPs). The latter file contains only those SNPs supported by at least two reads for any sample; this is a low-coverage dataset, so only a fraction of the SNPs meet this criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\nTo speed up the workflow on a system with multiple cores, modify the NUM_CORES variable in the GB-eaSy_parameters.txt file.  \r\n\r\nFor some users' configurations, the [software packages](#Software-requirements) may need to be added to the environmental variable PATH, which tells the bash shell where to find them. One way to do this is to edit the **.bash_profile** configuration file (~/.bash_profile), which exports environmental variables such as the PATH. \r\n \r\nFor example, if the path to java is /home/user/java/jre1.8.0_131/bin, then the following line should be added to ~/.bash_profile:  \r\n```\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/user/java/jre1.8.0_131/bin\r\n```  \r\nIf packages are added to the PATH in this manner, then place the following line at the top of the GB-eaSy.sh script:\r\n```\r\n. ~/.bash_profile\r\n```\r\n\r"
