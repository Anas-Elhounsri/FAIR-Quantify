        "value": "================\n**1. How do I make an interleaved FASTQ from paired FASTQs?**\n\nPaired FASTQ files must be merged into a single interleaved file. If your FASTQ pairs are in two separate files, you can merge them into an interleaved file with this command:\n\n`cat awesome_genome.1.fq awesome_genome.2.fq | paste - - - - | sort -k1,1 -t \" \" | tr \"\\t\" \"\\n\" > awesome_genome.interleaved.fastq`\n\nAlternatively, if you have a single FASTQ file with pairs but it is not collated, you can use this version of the command:\n\n`cat awesome_genome.unsorted.fq  | paste - - - - | sort -k1,1 -t \" \" | tr \"\\t\" \"\\n\" > awesome_genome.interleaved.fastq`\n\n\n**2. I have BAM/SAM files that are a mix of paired-end and single-end reads. Which mode should I use?**\n\nIf you want to use the guided detection you should separate the paired-reads from the singletons and run paired-read CRAM/BAM/SAM with the paired mode and the singletons in the unpaired mode.\n\nOtherwise, you can also run your CRAM/BAM/SAM in the unpaired mode and output only trimmed reads without corresponding mate information.\n\n**3. I would like to use the guided detection but I have a huge BAM file and I cannot be bothered to name sort or name sort + decompress. What should I do?**\n\nSTEAK accepts piped BAMs but for paired mode they must be collated by name. We have found biobambam2's bamcollate2 very useful in that you can pipe collated reads to STEAK. An example of this would be:\n\n`bamcollate2 filename=awesome_genome.messy.bam outputformat=sam | steak --pipe --TE-reference MOBILELEMENT.fasta --paired --aligned --output awesome_genome_mobi`\n\nHowever, we do encourage you make sure that your reads are truly collated in pairs to avoid errors from STEAK.\n\n**4. How do I make STEAK process my SAM/FASTQ in a parallel fashion?**\n\nMake sure you have MPI first. Then, for example, if you were to run with 200 cores:\n\n`mpirun -n 200 steak --input ALL_DA_GENOMES.sam --TE-reference MOBILELEMENT.fasta --paired --aligned`\n\nNote: mpirun is **only** for SAMs and FASTQs. Compressed files (BAM/CRAM) can only be read through pipe with one process. \n\nIf you wish to handle the BAM/CRAM in a multithread fashion you can do the following:\n\n`export $OMP_NUM_THREADS=4`\n\n`bamcollate2 filename=awesome_genome.bam outputformat=sam | steak --pipe --TE-reference MOBILELEMENT.fasta --paired --aligned --output awesome_genome_mobi`\n\n**5. Where can I get TE annotations for my genome of interest?**\n\nIf your HTS data corresponds to the genome of a well annotated species, then you can find reference TE annotations on RepeatMasker(http://www.repeatmasker.org/genomicDatasets/RMGenomicDatasets.html). The *.fa.out(.gz) files for each build are tabular files with the respective TE information (chromosome, position, strand, name, etc).\n\nIf you want to search for known non-reference integrations, it's best to trust the respective literature for your TE of interest.\n\nFor an updated database of human retrotransposons see dbRIP: http://dbrip.brocku.ca\n\n**6. How can I find which read causes a problem?**\n\nThe name of the read being processed can be displayed. This allows the easy identification of the read that causes a crash but can create a large amount of data. This can be achieved by recompling STEAK to enable its debug mode and subsequently running it normally. For clarity, it is best to use this feature with a single process and a single thread.\n\n`make clean`\n\n`make debug`\n"
