Ideally, BS-seq experiment should be able to directly and exactly identify the methylation state of a DNA fragment from the original genome. However, current BS-seq protocols still possess several intrinsic biases, which will impact methylation level estimation, such as overhang end-repair, 5\ufffd bisulfite conversion failure, sequencing into the adaptor and 3\ufffd low sequencing quality.  Since BS-seq experiments are widely used and the resulting data will continue to grow exponentially in the near future, there is a strong need for a dedicated QC tool to evaluate and remove potential technical biases in BS-seq experiments. Here, we developed BSeQC package. It can comprehensively evaluate the quality of BS-seq experiments and automatically trim nucleotides with potential technical biases that may result in inaccurate methylation estimation. In addition, BSeQC also support removing duplicate reads and keeping one copy of the overlapping segment in paired-end sequencing.  \n4.\tUsage Information\nmbias: BSeQC main executable function \n-s or  --sam\t     \tThe SAM file for quality analysis; Multiple SAM file should be separated by the ','.\t(Mandatory)\n-r or  --ref\t     \tThe reference genome fasta file.\t(Mandatory)\n-t or  --samtools       The path of samtools.\t\t(Optional)\n-n or  --name\t     \tThe name for the output plot and table.\tdefault = 'NA' (Optional)\n-l or  --len\t     \tIf the original mapping reads have been trimmed with adapter or other reasons, the original read length for the sam file should be set.
