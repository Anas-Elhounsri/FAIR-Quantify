A description text file should specify the metabolites of interest by their m/z values and retention time (RT). Ramid evaluates mass isotopomer distributions (MID) of metabolites at the moments of their maximal elution rates, expected to be close to the specified a priori RT values. Ramid uses library \"ncdf4\" to read the NetCDF files containing the raw data. It is necessary to install it before the first use of Ramid. The files \"ramid.R\" and \"lib.R\" located in a subdirectory 'R' contain the complete code of Ramid. Its functions reside in reading NetCDF files, extracting and visualizing the spectra that they contain. \n<p>Midcor takes the spectra extracted by Ramid and corrects them for natural isotope occurrence and possible overlapping with those of some foreign substances. Thus it provides the mass isotopomer distribution (MID) produced by isotopes artificially introduced into the substrates used.</p>\nIsoform reads the results of Midcor and prepares the data for simulation with Isodyn.  For each metabolite, groups the corrected MID by the conditions that will be simulated and then by the time of sampling. Then it finds the mean value and SD inside the groups, combines the obtained values for all the metabolites whose MID Isodyn will use in the same simulation.\n"
