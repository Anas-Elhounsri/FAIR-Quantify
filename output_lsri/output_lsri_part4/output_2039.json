Matching Read Sequence - The matching portion of the read sequence in the case of a single unique match.

Number of zero mismatch matches - The number of matches containing no mismatches.\r\n\r\n5. Number of one mismatch matches - The number of matches containing one mismatch.\r\n\r\n6. Number of two mismatch matches - The number of matches containing two mismatches.\r\n\r\nIf there is a unique match, the following fields will be filled:\r\n\r\n7. Reference Id - The FASTA id of the matching reference sequence, or the name of the input file in the case of \"raw\" format reference files.\r\n\r\n8. Match position - The position of the match within the reference sequence (1...n, where 1 is the first base in the reference sequence)\r\n\r\n9. Forward or Reverse - Read matched on either the forward (F) or reverse complementary (R) strand of the reference sequence.\r\n\r\n10. Unused - In MOM, this field is unused and will always contain \".\"\r\n\r\n11. Mismatching bases  - A space separated list of the mismatches between the reference and query sequences.
