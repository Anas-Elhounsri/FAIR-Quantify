During the alignment step, in the worst case, the memory used is proportional with the size of the biggest sequence of the nodes in the graph.\nThe execution time increases with the number of query sequence.  \nIn output, Blastree displays for each query sequence, the paths (nodes ID) where the query is matching. \n \n"
