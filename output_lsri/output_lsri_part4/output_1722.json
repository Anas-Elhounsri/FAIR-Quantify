The next time you run molgenis-impute.py it will detect the new files and do the appropriate conversions. Plase take note that some conversion take a considerable amount of time, specially for large vcf files. \n\nThis is the recommended way for installing a new reference panel. Alternatively, if you want to install your own .haps and .legend files, you can place them in a new directory under ```molgenis_imputation/resources/imputationReference```. Each chromosome should be in a separate pair of files. If the files are uncompressed the extension should be .haps and .legend . Optionally, the files can be compressed with gzip and the files' extensions should be: .haps.gz and .legend.gz . For example: 1000_GP_chr1.haps.gz and 1000_GP_chr1.legend.gz. Finally either the .vcf or the compressed .vcf.gz should also exist in this directory for each chromosome. **IMPORTANT:** The .vcf.gz files should **not** be compressed with gzip, but with bgzip instead. bgzip is installed in tools/tabix-0.2.6/ . \n\nThere are more alternative ways to install a reference panel. In general molgenis-impute supports the following reference panels formats:\n* [SHAPEIT2 Format](http://www.shapeit.fr/pages/m02_formats/hapssample.html): Files should be per chromosome. Example: chr1_SHAPEIT.haps and chr1_SHAPEIT.sample (The _SHAPEIT part is necessary in order to make a distiction from impute2 .haps files)\n* [Impute2 Format](http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html#-h): Files shoud be per chromosome. Example: chr1.haps , chr1.legend . There should also be a SINGLE .sample file. \n* [Impute2 Format](http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html#-h) compressed: Files should be per chromosome. Example: chr1.haps.gz , chr1.legend.gz . There should also be a SINGLE .sample file (not compressed). This is the default format of the reference panels available from impute2. For example: http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/data_download_1000G_phase1_integrated_SHAPEIT2_9-12-13.html . Take note that some panels have the filename pattern of chr1.hap.gz instead of chr1.hap**s**.gz . In this case you will need to rename the files. \n* VCF: A single vcf file.\n* VCF compressed. A single compressed (with bgzip NOT gzip) vcf file. Example panel.vcf.gz\n\nFor all these files molgenis-compute will try to do its best to apply the appropriate conversions before performing imputation. If you have a special request or you notice a bug please let me know!\n\nTo make use of the new reference in the imputation step use the option --reference < REFERENCE_NAME >. The < REFERENCE_NAME > is the name of the created directory under ```molgenis_imputation/resources/imputationReference``` . (If unsure run python molgenis-impute.py --list for a list of available reference panels)\n"

Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"
