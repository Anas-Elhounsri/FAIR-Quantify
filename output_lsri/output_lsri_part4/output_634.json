These are the KOs that will be used to determine the compounds that could be generated by the bacterial community. This and the output directory where all results will be written are the only required requirements. There are two other optional inputs: `detected_compounds` and `other_gene_set`. `detected_compounds` is a set of compounds that where detected in metabolomics of the sample and can come in any of the forms available for the input. `other_gene_set` is a set of KO ids that are encoded by the host or another set of genes that can be expressed as KO ids. This can also take any of the forms available to the  input parameter.\n\nTwo flags are available that will affect the Venn diagram made and the enrichment analysis that is done. `detected_only` will only include compounds that were detected as the background set of compounds for the hypergeometric test. This flag requires the `compound_detected` variable to be used. The `rn_compound_only` flag makes it so that only detected compounds which have a reaction associated with them in KEGG will be used for both the Venn diagram and the hypergeometric test.\n\nFinally a set of locations for KEGG FTP downloaded files is avaliable. These inputs are optional and if they are not provided the KEGG API will be used to retrieve the records necessary. It is much faster to run with the KEGG FTP downloaded files if you have access to them.\n\n**NOTE: the KEGG API has limits. For small datasets, (< 100 KOs/COs), data can be pulled quickly and in parallel. However, pulling all data for a reasonably sized dataset from the KEGG API will be rate-limited by KEGG and cannot be done in parallel. Sometimes, KEGG will even deny the connection for this synchronous download if you have hit the request rate limit. If this happens, you may have to wait 30-60 minutes before trying again. If you have any suggestions for how to work within these limits please create an issue or pull request with a fix. Otherwise, paying for a subscription to the [KEGG FTP](https://www.pathway.jp/en/academic.html) will avoid this issue entirely.**\n"

This file can be used as input [here](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/tool/map_pathway2.html). This will color the detected compounds. Blue compounds are generated only by the microbiome and yellow are generated only by the host. Yellow compounds could have been generated by both. Compounds that were detected have an orange outline, with a light orange fill if that compound was not predicted to be produced by microbiome or host.\n\nThe bacteria_enrichment.tsv file, and the host_enrichment.tsv file if the `other_gene_set` parameter is given, gives the results of the pathway enrichment analysis from the compounds able to be produced by the KOs provided.
