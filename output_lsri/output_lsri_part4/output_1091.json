        "description": "**MapOptics v2.0**\r\n\r\nFollowing user community feedback that MapOptics is slow to load and can crash using large datasets, MapOptics has been redesigned to address these issues. \r\n\r\nMapOptics v2.0 is being released to highlight the incredible improvements to the speed of loading and interacting with the optical mapping datasets. Currently the GUI and functions of MapOptics will look very similar to MapOptics v.0.1.10 but the performance has been enhanced. \r\n\r\n**Improvements**\r\n\r\nTime spent loading Xmaps and Cmaps has been significantly reduced and memory usage has been reduced by over 50% compared to MapOptics v.1.10. \r\n\r\nThese performance gains allow very large datasets with reference genome map 250 Mbp in length and with 1000\u2019s of aligned query contigs to be loaded in seconds, with ease. \r\n\r\nMapOptics v2.0 memory usage has been optimised by dynamically storing only data of interest with respect to the reference contig chosen. \r\n\r\nThis is coupled with a streamlined sorting query contig algorithm which lays out the query contigs in a manner that the user can see all queries even in heavy overlapping alignment regions, meaning easy navigation between Summary, Reference and Query View with no lag. \r\n\r\nDeleted contigs are now stored in such a way to allow fast loading of references that have been modified by the user. \r\n\r\nQuery View has been improved so that the selected range of interest or the selected Query from Reference View will be drawn and interactable almost instantly. \r\n\r\n**New Features**\r\n\r\nSV view tab:\r\nAddition of the SV View tab to allow the visualisation of structural variants between maps (insertions and deletions). For each selected reference the user will be provided with an SV table providing information on all the structural variants present between that reference and its associated queries. Upon selection of the structural variant of interest, the user will be presented with a high-resolution view of the structural variant.\r\n\r\nReference View: \r\nMost recently moved contig is highlighted in Reference View. Not only is the currently selected contig highlighted with a GOLD border in the Reference View, the most recently moved contig is highlighted with a BLUE border to give the user feedback on the contigs they are interacting with. \r\n\r\nExport Tables: \r\nNew menu option to save the entries in the Query Contigs table (Reference View) and Query labels table (Query View) for user selected References and Queries.
