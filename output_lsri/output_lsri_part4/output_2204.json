Briefly, the seqlm method works in three stages.  \n**Stage 1:** The genome is divided into smaller pieces based on a genomic distance cutoff.  \n**Stage 2:** In each piece probes are segmented into regions that have approximately constant difference between the groups of interest. Example of the segmentation and its process is shown in [schema]. \n* In sliding windows with variable sizes we fit a linear models to the data.\n* For each model we record the description length - the amount of bits needed to describe the data using the model\n* Using dynamic programming we find the segmentation that minimizes total description length \n**Stage 3:** We assess the relevance of each segment, by using a mixed model where the classes are a fixed effect and a sample is a random effect. This model takes into account the repeated nature of the consecutive methylation measurements. The segments are ordered by their significance. \n"

The main input for this function is the result of `seqlm` and the three objects described above. There are additional options to control the appearance of the plots, see `?seqlmreport` for details. \n"

If the computer has multicore capabilities it is easy to parallelize the calculations. We use the [foreach](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreach/index.html) framework by Revolution Computing for parallelization.
