The pipeline is run as an R package and automatically generates the needed folders and summary statistics for each processing step, allowing you to trouble shoot and adjust settings as needed. Checking the data and statistics after each processing step is a key element of JAMP and encouraged as it also gives you a better understanding of your data and the bioinformatic process.\n\n**End of 2021 update:** Currently updating the documentation and older functions for a more streamlined experience :smile: .\n\nFor a a short tutorial on extracting haplotypes / ESVs from metabarcoding datasets take a look at the [denoising quick guide](https://github.com/VascoElbrecht/JAMP/wiki/3)-Denoising-quick-guide!).\n\n"

        "description": "OTU clustering improvements:\r\n* Raw OTU filesa re now keept on defult (when using `delete_data`). The file is now also correctly names with OTU in the end.\r\n* Accuracy of mapping can now be adjusted. Defult settings should be fine for most projects that cluster at 3% similarity, but below that maxaccepts / rejects should be set to 0.\r\n* Once can now choos to not mapp singletons against the OTUs (this will reduce sequencing depth, but might lead to slightly more accurate results). Not worth it in most cases, but now the option is there : )\r\n",
