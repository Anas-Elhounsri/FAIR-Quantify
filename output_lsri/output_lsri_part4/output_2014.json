[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com) and [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) are popular numerical computing environments used by modelers in biology, but while toolboxes for using SBML exist, many researchers either have legacy models or do not learn about the toolboxes before starting their work and then find it discouragingly difficult to export their MATLAB/Octave models to SBML.\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop software that uses a combination of heuristics and user assistance to help researchers export models written as ordinary MATLAB and Octave scripts. MOCCASIN (*\"Model ODE Converter for Creating Automated SBML INteroperability\"*) helps researchers take ODE (ordinary differential equation) models written in MATLAB and Octave and export them as SBML files.  Although its scope is limited to MATLAB written with certain assumptions, and general conversion of MATLAB models is impossible, MOCCASIN nevertheless *can* translate some common forms of models into SBML.\n\nMOCCASIN is written in Python and does _not_ require MATLAB to run.\n\n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "MOCCASIN parses MATLAB files using a novel MATLAB parser developed by the authors and written entirely in Python.  It applies post-processing operations in order to interpret the MATLAB contents, then uses a network service provided by the [Biochemical Abstract Machine (BIOCHAM)](https://lifeware.inria.fr/biocham/) to invoke an algorithm developed by Fages, Gay and Soliman described in their 2015 paper titled [_Inferring reaction systems from ordinary differential equations_](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397514006197).  (A free technical report explaining the algorithm is [available from INRIA](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01103692).)  Finally, it applies some post-processing to the results returned by BIOCHAM to produce the completed SBML output. \nCurrently, MOCCASIN is limited to MATLAB inputs in which a model is contained in a single file.  The file must set up a system of differential equations as a function defined in the file, and make a call to one of the MATLAB `odeNN` family of solvers (e.g., `ode45`, `ode15s`, etc.).  The following is a simple but complete example:\n```matlab\n% Various parameter settings.  The specifics here are unimportant; this\n% is just an example of a real input file.\n%\ntspan  = [0 300];\nxinit  = [0; 0];\na      = 0.01 * 60;\nb      = 0.0058 * 60;\nc      = 0.006 * 60;\nd      = 0.000192 * 60;\n\n% A call to a MATLAB ODE solver\n%\n[t, x] = ode45(@f, tspan, xinit);\n\n% A function that defines the ODEs of the model.\n%\nfunction dx = f(t, x)\n  dx = [a - b * x(1); c * x(1) - d * x(2)];\nend\n```\n \nYou can view the SBML output for this example [in a separate file](docs/project/examples/example.xml).  MOCCASIN assumes that the second parameter in the ODE function definition determines the variables that identify the SBML species; thus, the output generated by MOCCASIN will have SBML species named `x_1` and `x_2` by default.  (The use of suffixes is necessary because plain SBML does not support arrays or vectors.)  The output will also not capture any information about the particular ODE solver or the start/stop/configuration parameters used in the file, because that kind of information is not meant to be stored in SBML files anyway.  (A future version of MOCCASIN will hopefully translate the additional run information into [SED-ML](http://sed-ml.org) format.) \n"

        "description": "This release fixes a few bugs, but the most important new development is the introduction of self-contained executables of MOCCASIN: users no longer need to install or interact with Python at all, because MOCCASIN is now available in a form that is like any other ordinary program.\r\n\r\nEnhancements:\r\n\r\n* We have successfully built self-contained, standalone executable versions of MOCCASIN so that users do not need to install wxPython or other dependencies&mdash;or even have Python installed on their computers at all. This has been made possible through the use of [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org). A downside to this approach is that the executables are specific to operating system versions and we must distribute copies for specific OS versions (and not simply for OS families).\r\n\r\n* The keyboard shortcut for running conversions has been changed to <kbd>control</kbd>-<kbd>r</kbd> instead of <kbd>control</kbd>-<kbd>c</kbd>, to avoid confusion with a common  editing shortcut.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* The GUI interface no longer throws an error if you try to type in the file path text box.\r\n\r\n* The converter no longer generates an error if it encounters uses of MATLAB `zeros()` or `ones()` that employ variables instead of numbers.\r\n\r\n* Some aesthetic inconsistencies in the GUI layout have been fixed.\r\n\r\n* Other miscellaneous bugs have been fixed.",

        "description": "There are three important changes in release 1.2.0 of MOCCASIN.  The first is a *massive* improvement to the speed of parsing MATLAB files compared to recent performance.  The second is the elimination of the separate `moccasin_CLI` and `moccasin_GUI` entry points in favor of a single program, `moccasin`, that can be used either to start the GUI or perform actions via the command line.  The third is corrections of errors in the installation scripts so that `setup.py` now correctly installs dependencies, thus making installation much easier than before for most users.\r\n\r\nEnhancements:\r\n\r\n* New command-line driver interface called, simply, `moccasin`.  It features a revised set of command-line options, snazzy colors, spinners and more!\r\n\r\n* A past enhancement to `setup.py` caused it to stop being able to install dependencies normally, with the consequence that users had to install dependent Python packages by hand.  This was problematic in many cases because the packages were not always easily installed.  The errors in `setup.py` have been corrected.\r\n\r\n* The installation instructions have been updated and improved.\r\n\r\n* The GUI interface has been enhanced.  In addition, the GUI interface now provides (hopefully) more helpful dialogs in error situations.\r\n\r\n* Huge performance improvements.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [#49](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/issues/49) Fixed extreme slowness of MATLAB parser.\r\n\r\n* [#46](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/issues/46) Fix for moccasin GUI not launching.\r\n\r\n* [#51](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/issues/51) Fixed bugs in checking whether MATLAB input is translatable, and add support for use of element-wise operators such as `.*` when they are not actually being used on matrices.\r\n\r\n* [#52](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/issues/52) Fixed bug in writing out very large numbers. Thanks to user [@willigott](https://github.com/willigott) for reporting the issue.\r\n\r\n* [#53](https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin/issues/53) Biocham currently seems to mistranslate unary negation, at least in some situations.  MOCCASIN now has a workaround that replaces expressions of the form `-x` with `-1 * x`, which works better when passed to Biocham.  This is hopefully temporary, until Biocham has a chance to address whatever the underlying issue is.  Many thanks to user [@willigott](https://github.com/willigott) for reporting the issue and suggesting the workaround.",

        "description": "This release features a major overhaul of the underlying MATLAB parser, as well as a substantial rewrite of the SBML/XPP converter code. The new system is much more robust in the face of a greater range of MATLAB inputs, although the types of MATLAB models it recognizes and can convert are still relatively limited.\n\nThe new MATLAB parser correctly parses much more of the MATLAB syntax, thus eliminating many previous parsing errors and failures. There are now hundreds of new test cases for different syntactic forms of MATLAB. The known cases of MATLAB syntax that are not yet handled are only the following:\n- user-defined classes are not yet supported at all\n- cell arrays are parsed in a limited way, and in particular, nested cell array references will fail\n- commas and spaces cannot be mixed in a row of an array: e.g., `[1, 2 -3 +4]` will fail to parse as expected\n- comments inside arrays are discarded\n- comments after continuations are discarded\n- continuations (i.e., `...`) inside strings will cause the strings to be mangled\n- continuations in shell commands are not handled correctly\n\nThe MATLAB parser also implements a weak, heuristic form of \"kind\" analysis to try to disambiguate function calls from array references (which in MATLAB are syntactically identical). The inability of MOCCASIN to access the user's MATLAB environment makes it impossible for MOCCASIN to ever be able to do full kind analysis, but the heuristics take it very far for many use-cases in MOCCASIN's domain.\n\nThe updated converter is more robust for more cases, and reports many more errors and failures of conversion. It takes advantage of more features of the XPP input syntax handled by BIOCHAM, allowing the final converted SBML output to be a more faithful representation of the input model.  However, the scope of models it can convert has only widened slightly &ndash; the converter is _not_ yet able to convert a greater range of MATLAB models than it did before. Handling a wider range of MATLAB inputs will require implementing solutions to such things as handling loops, handling `if` statements, loading `.mat` files, and converting array variables into scalar variables so that they can be expressed in SBML (which does not yet support array variables).\n\nDespite these limitations, the converter is able to convert significant real-world models. As an example of the capabilities of MOCCASIN 1.1.0, it was used to convert [model BIOMD0000000608](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/BIOMD0000000608) in BioModels Database. The original MATLAB model is 770 lines long and the converted form has 140 SBML reactions.\n",
