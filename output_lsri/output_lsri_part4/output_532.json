We are in contact with the NCBO BioPortal team to attempt to fix this. Version 2.0.2 was another failed attempt, and does not function correctly (and therefore has not been updated). \nVersion 2.0.3 returns to the 2.0.0 PURLs and includes additional new Homosaurus mappings, mappings from the Leather Archives and Museum (LA&M), and mappings from the GLBT Historical Society's Archives. \nVersions 2.0.4 and onward switch to OBO Foundry compliant PURLs, which will be maintained for all future versions. \nVersion 2.0.6 is an intermediate version, adding a number of terms from the backlog of needed additions, as well as touching up a number of existing entries. It is still a work-in-progress and do not yet contain full mappings to versions 1 and 3 of the Homosaurus. \nVersion 2.0.7 is an alpha version, as the conversion to OBO format is not currently working. Please be patient as we attempt to fix the issue. \nVersion 2.0.8 is also in alpha, with only a couple small changes based on reported issues. Conversion to JSON and OBO formats has not been possible, so those files are still version 2.0.7 as of 8 July 2022. \n"

Please rest assured, I am working on getting everything up-to-date as soon as possible to prevent errors and confusion. \nUpdate, 24 October 2023: I have been engaging in efforts to expand the GSSO in a format more easily accessible to those without significant programming, database, or ontology experience. I have settled on using a Wikibase setup to attain these goals. So far I have been prototyping this structure . I am still seeking a source of funding in order to work on the database and vocabulary full-time; please feel free to reach out to me if there are any suggestions you may have regarding full-time funding or positions in which I could continue this work full-time. This new work will include a complete mapping to all versions of the GSSO, meaning all usage of the current GSSO elements will remain intact.

All IDs all the same, but the rest of the URI has changed, i.e.:\n\n```\nhttp://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/GSSO/000047\n```\n\nAnd \n\n```\nhttp://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/GSSO/GSSO_000047\n```\n\nAre now rendered as:\n\n```\nhttp://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_000047\n```\n\nBecause the BioPortal system requires encoded URLs, we will shift this into:\n\n```\nhttp%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGSSO_000047\n```\n\nThis can also be accomplished using any URL encoder, such as: https://www.urlencoder.org/.\n\nThis is why the normal NCBO BioPortal link is rendered as:\n\n```\nhttps://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/GSSO/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGSSO_000047\n```\n\n(however, note that `https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/GSSO/?p=classes&conceptid=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_000047` will also work.)\n\nThe full URL for access to the class is thus:\n\n```\nhttp://data.bioontology.org/ontologies/GSSO/classes/http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGSSO_000047/\n```\n\nNote that this method will only grab instances from the current class, not from subclasses; i.e. the following:\n\n```\nhttp://data.bioontology.org/ontologies/GSSO/classes/http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGSSO_000140/instances\n```\n\nWill pull LGBTQ slang, but not transgender slang.\n\nNote that if any of the following queries do not function, reattempt with just the identifier and note the full URL. Alternatively use the URL as a search term via the GSSO website itself if problems persist.\n\nFor instance, the Homosaurus link mapping can be obtained using:\n\n```\nhttps://gsso.research.cchmc.org/#!/entry?iri=http://homosaurus.org/v2/LGBTQPeople\n```\n\non the website.\n"
