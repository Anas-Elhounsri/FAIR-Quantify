It was used to quickly locate\nregions on the human genome that expressed a desired level of variability,\nwhich were \"just right\" for later variant calling and comparison. \nThe package has since been made more flexible and can be used to find regions\nof interest based on other criteria such as GC-content, density of target k-mers,\ndefined confidence metrics and missing nucleotides. \n"

For each chromosome from\neach sample, each subsequence or 'region' is passed to the user's chosen strategy.\n\nThe strategy simply defines what is of interest to the user in a language that\nGoldilocks can understand. Goldilocks is currently packaged with the following\nstrategies:\n\n============================      ==================\nStrategy                          Census Description\n============================      ==================\nGCRatioStrategy                   Calculate GC-ratio for subregions across the\n                                  genome.\nNucleotideCounterStrategy         Count given nucleotides for subregions across\n                                  the genome.\nMotifCounterStrategy              Search for one or more particular motifs of\n                                  interest of any and varying size in subregions\n                                  across the genome.\nReferenceConsensusStrategy        Calculate the (dis)similarity to a given\n                                  reference across the genome.\nPositionCounterStrategy           Given a list of base locations, calculate\n                                  density of those locations over subregions\n                                  across the genome.\n============================      ==================\n\nOnce all regions have been 'censused', the results may be sorted by one of four\nmathematical operations: `max`, `min`, `median` and `mean`. So you may be interested\nin subregions of your sequence(s) that feature the most missing nucleotides, or\nsubregions that contain the mean or median number of SNPs or the lowest GC-ratio.\n\n"

Every strategy\ncan quickly be swapped with another by changing one line of your code. Every strategy\nreturns regions in the same format and so you need not waste time munging data to\nfit the rest of your pipeline.\n\nStrategies are also customisable and extendable, those even vaguely familiar with\nPython should be able to construct a strategy to meet their requirements.\n\nGoldilocks is maintained, documented and tested, rather than that hacky perl\nscript that you inherited years ago from somebody who has now left your lab.\n\n"
