The aim of this package is to design suites of candidate models to create diverse calibrations of Maxent models and enable selection of optimal parameterizations for each study. Other objectives of this program are to make the task of creating final models and their transfers easier, as well to permit assessing extrapolation risks when model transfers are needed.\n\nThis document is a brief tutorial for using the functions of the **kuenm** R package. The example of a disease vector (a tick) is used in this tutorial to make it more clear and understandable. Functions help can be checked while performing the processes.\n\n<br>\n"

Following this structure (Figure 1) will allow working with one or more species in a project, and avoid potential problems during the analyses.\n\nBefore starting the analyses, the user must make sure that the working directory (the folder with information for an individual species) has the following components:\n\n-   A folder containing the distinct sets of environmental variables (i.e., M\\_variables in Figure 1) to be used (more than one is highly recommended, but not mandatory). These variables must represent environmental variation across the area over which models are calibrated.\n-   A csv file containing training and testing occurrence data together (preferably after cleaning and thinning original data to avoid problems like wrong records and spatial auto-correlation). This data set consists of three fields: species name, longitude, and latitude. See Sp\\_joint.csv, in Figure 1.\n-   A csv file containing occurrence data for training models. This file and the next file generally represent exclusive subsets of the full set of records. Occurrences can be subsetted in multiple ways (Muscarella et al. 2014), but some degree of independence of training and testing data is desired. See Sp\\_train.csv in Figure 1.\n-   A csv file containing species occurrence data for testing models as part of the calibration process (i.e., Sp\\_test.csv in Figure 1).\n-   If available, a csv file containing a completely independent subset of occurrence data\u2014external to training and testing data\u2014for a final, formal model evaluation. This dataset (i.e., for final model evaluation) is given as Sp\\_ind.csv in Figure 1.\n\n<br>\n\n<img src=\"Structure.png\" alt=\"Figure 1.
