Ensure any unnecessary install or build dependencies and other files are removed before the end of the layer when\n   doing a build.\n2. Explain the changes and update the README.md file and other documentation if necessary.\n3. Be ready to communicate about the Pull Request and make changes if required by reviewers.\n4. The Pull Request may be merged once it passes the review and automatic checks.\n\n## Gitflow Workflow\n\nWe use the standard [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow):\n\n* __master__ branch is used only for releases (and eventually hotfixes), this branch is also protected on GitHub (pull\n  requests with review and all checks must pass)\n* __develop__ branch is used for development and as a base for following development branches of features, support\n  stuff, and as a base for releases\n* __feature/*__ (base develop, rebase-merged back to develop when done)\n* __chore/*__ (like the feature but semantically different, not the feature but some chore, e.g., cleanup or update of\n  Dockerfile)\n* __fix/*__ (like the feature but semantically different, not something new but fix of a non-critical bug)\n* __release/*__ (base develop, merged to master and develop when ready for release+tag)\n* __hotfix/*__ (base master, merged to master and develop)\n\nPlease note, that for tasks from [our Jira](https://dtl-fair.atlassian.net/projects/FDP/issues), we use such\nas `[FDP-XX]` identifying the project and task number.\n\n## Release Management\n\nFor the release management we use (aside from\nthe [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)):\n\n* [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org)\n* Release Candidates - X.Y.Z-rc.N should be created if don\u2019t expect any problems (in that case use alpha or beta), and\n  make a walkthrough to verify its functionality according to the manuals finally - it also verifies that the\n  documentation is up to date with the new version.\n* [CHANGELOG.md](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ )\n* GitHub releases and tags - make the release using GitHub (or hub extension), CI will automatically upload ZIP and TGZ\n  distribution files there - better verify.\n* Docker Hub image - in case of release, Docker image with the same tag will be created automatically.\n* The matching version of [FDP](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint)\n  , [FDP-Client](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint-client),\n  and [OpenRefine extension](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/OpenRefine-metadata-extension) must be always compatible.\n\nAlso, never forget to update the\njoint [FAIR Data Point documentation](https://github.com/FAIRDataTeam/FAIRDataPoint-Docs)!\n"
