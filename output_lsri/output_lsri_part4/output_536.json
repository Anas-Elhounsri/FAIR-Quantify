        "value": "GraphMap is a novel mapper targeted at aligning long, error-prone third-generation sequencing data.  \nIt is **designed to handle Oxford Nanopore MinION 1d and 2d reads** with very high sensitivity and accuracy, and also presents a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art for PacBio read mappers.\n\nGraphMap was also designed for ease-of-use: the **default parameters** can handle a wide range of read lengths and error profiles, including: *Illumina*, *PacBio* and *Oxford Nanopore*.  \nThis is an especially important feature for technologies where the error rates and error profiles can vary widely across, or even within, sequencing runs.  \n\n**The GraphMap algorithm** is structured to achieve high-sensitivity and speed using a five-stage\nread-funneling approach. In stage I, GraphMap uses a novel adaptation of gapped spaced seeds to efficiently reduce the search space and get seed hits as a form of coarse alignment. These are then refined in stage II using graph-based vertex-centric processing of seeds to efficiently construct alignment anchors. GraphMap then chains anchors using a kmer\nversion of longest common subsequence (LCSk) construction (stage III), refines\nalignments by chaining anchors in the anchored mode or with a form of L1 linear regression in the semiglobal alignment mode (stage IV) and finally evaluates the\nremaining candidates to select the best location to reconstruct a final alignment (stage V).\nGraphMap computes a BLAST-like E-value as well as a mapping quality for its alignments.\n\n**Evaluation** on MinION sequencing datasets against short and long-read mappers indicates that GraphMap increases mapping sensitivity by at least 15-80%. GraphMap alignments are the first to demonstrate consensus calling with <1 error in 100,000 bases, variant calling on the human genome with 76% improvement in sensitivity over the next best mapper (BWA-MEM), precise detection of structural variants from 100bp to 4kbp in length and species and strain-specific identification of pathogens using MinION reads.\n\nFurther details about the algorithm, comparison with other mappers and usage applications can be found in the **preprint** of our paper:  \n[Fast and sensitive mapping of error-prone nanopore sequencing reads with GraphMap](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/06/10/020719)  \n\n**Nanopore sequencing data** of E. Coli UTI89 generated in-house and used in the paper now available on ENA:  \n[PRJEB9557](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB9557)  \n"

        "value": "Cigar string different from read length bug fixed. Segmentation fault in ksw2 fixed. Version bumped. \nVersion, containing tuning of alignments specific for long RNA reads. \nBugfix version, addressing several segfault and other important issues:  \n- Fixed mapping outside of reference bounds.  \n- Merged a pull request with some useful insanity tests (thanks @robegan21).\n- Changed the unmapped / Inf E-value (the ZE:f: tag) to be a valid float value (`std::numeric_limits<float>::max()` instead of `Inf`).  \n- Added several missing `#include`s.   \nPatch version resolving huge memory consumption when building the index.  \nIndex construction now consumes similar amount of memory as the final constructed index.  \nIndex files (stored to disk) constructed using v0.5.0 are fully compatible with v0.5.1 and can be used directly.   \nThere are several new important features to mention:  \n- The index supports minimizers - the minimizer window size can be specified via command line and by default is equal to ```5```. To switch off minimizers, use BASH5*.  \n- The number of hits for each seed lookup is now thresholded by a percentile value, e.g. BASH6* means that BASH7* of the most repetitive seeds will be skipped. To turn off this feature, specify BASH8*. This feature slightly reduces sensitivity, but plays a huge role when mapping to large references.  \n- BASH9* enables building the index on the fly, instead of storing it to disk.  \n- To switch off minimizers and percentile filtering, there is a composite option BASH10*. This will produce results similar to previous versions.\n- In case the version of an index file is not compatible with GraphMap, previous versions would automatically overwrite the index file. This is now prevented by default, and GraphMap now simply halts with a command line message. To force automatic rebuild if necessary (but not rebuild if a valid index file exists), use: BASH11*. To rebuild the index in any case, specify: BASH12*.  \n- Renamed the BASH13* mode to BASH14*   \nOwler overlapping mode was also enhanced with the new index, and now works much faster on larger datasets. Also, Owler allows for spaced seeds, and a custom shape can be specified via commandline (```--shape``` parameter, default is a full 15bp seed).    \nMany bug fixes were also made, including the ones related to mapping to circular references, various segfaults, and extra new lines when outputting secondary alignments. Some of the segfaults were caused by the index, which is now addressed with the new version. \nAlso, this release fixes an issue with **transcriptome mapping**, where recall would drop (however, not precision).   \n"
