If you do not want to run SAUCIE on all columns in the input file, a file named cols_to_use.txt with the 0-indexed column numbers, one per line can be provided.\n\nIn the output directory, if batch correction was done, there will be a folder ```batch_corrected``` with a batch-corrected CSV (or FCS) file corresponding to each original file. If clustering was done, there will also be a folder ```clustered``` with a clustered file corresponding to each original file. In each clustered file, there is either the original or batch-corrected data with additional columns giving the cluster number and the X and Y coordinate for the visualization.\n"
