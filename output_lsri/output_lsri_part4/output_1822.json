        "description": "To date, the evaluation of the reserves relies solely on biological data, ignoring socioeconomic and governance dimensions. In absence of a standardized methodology, existing data is analyzed in different ways, hindering the ability to compare results across communities. We developed a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of the reserves by matching 7 commonly stated management objectives to a set of 9 biophysical, 5 socioeconomic, and 15 governance indicators. This framework includes a standardized survey to collect governance and socioeconomic data. Biophysical indicators are evaluated with a Difference-in-Difference analysis, estimating the net effect of the reserve through time. Linear regression models are fitted to socioeconomic indicators through time, testing for the difference in trends before and after the implementation of the reserve. Governance indicators are analyzed based on literature, identifying common governance structures and their associated effectiveness. To make the framework accessible to fishers and decision makers, and allow replication of results, we developed an open source application. The results produced by the application contain a report for a general audience, and a technical report that can inform the renewal and decision-making process.\r\n\r\nThe first release of MAREA is now available, and it will continue to be developed and maintained to keep up to date with the literature. This process will incorporate new features, and enhance current ones, aiming to improve user experience and expand the scope of the analysis. Yet, we believe that this first release represents a major step towards effective, replicable evaluation and management of marine reserves.",
