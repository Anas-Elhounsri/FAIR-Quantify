Canary correctly describes variants in HGVS nomenclature by \nmaking a number of calls to the Mutalyzer.nl website to render them with a Refseq transcript as an HGVSg, HGVSc and HGVSp and in their most 3' form. The preferred Refseq transcript for a gene\nis taken from a gene to transcript mapping file which may edited by the user if required. Complex multi-nucleotide variants are correctly rendered as delins variants in their most parsimonious form\nto save error-prone manual interpretation of these variants - a common cause of variant description error. \nClinical diagnostics is being transformed by the technology capable of analysing patient DNA at the nucleotide level. \nAmplicon sequencing is a cost effective way of deeply sequencing a panel of genes of interest. Canary has been implemented for use with a number of clinical cancer diagnostic panels\nat the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, the largest cancer only hospital in Australia. \nThe accuracy, turn around time and reproducibility of clinical diagnostic sequencing relies heavily on bioinformatics pipelines to convert raw sequencing data into meaningful variants\nthat can be curated for patient reporting.\nCanary is a clinically tested tool which performs the key pipeline tasks of:\n- alignment of amplicon reads, \n- calling of variants, \n- 3' shifting, \n- coalescing of MNPs (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), \n- Refseq transcript selection,\n- rendering of variants into HGVS nomenclature and\n- annotation of the VCF file with MyVariant.info attributes.\n \n"

The location of this file is set by the properties file located in `etc/canary.properties`. Update the `genome.path` property to point to the genome reference. These can be obtained from [1000g](http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/) for various genome builds. \nAlso required for the `--normalise` flag is a file mapping genes to refseq transcripts. A default mapping is provided [here](https://github.com/PapenfussLab/Canary/blob/master/etc/transcript.tsv) but may be edited if other transcripts are preferred. We maintain this mapping as a curated list of preferred clinical transcripts that should be reported on. It is currently cancer centric reflecting its pedigree as a clinical cancer reporting tool. Mantaining this mapping allows for consistent reporting of transcripts that should reflect the most common literature reported transcript for a gene. While this is not suitable for all circumstances, it is a necessary simplification for routine clinical practices. \nWhen using the `--tsv` flag, a tab separated variable file is generated to expand out all VCF Info and Format fields as a tabular file suitable for loading into spreadsheets and databases. The fields to be rendered as a TSV file can be selected by using the `--cols` flag and providing a file of VCF field names to output to TSV. One per line with an optional alias after a comma if VCF field names needs to be renamed in the TSV header. (see [cols](https://github.com/PapenfussLab/Canary/blob/master/src/etc/cols)).\n \n"

        "description": "This is the initial public release of Canary.\r\nCanary is an efficient amplicon aligner, variant caller and annotator which transforms sequencer generated FASTQ files into VCF files annotated with HGVS nomenclature and Refseq transcripts. Implemented as a single JAR file, it is readily deployable onto any platform supporting Java runtime execution. All variants identified by Canary are 3\u2019 shifted and represented in their most parsimonious form to provide a consistent representation irrespective of how the reads represent base changes. Further, proximate in-phase variants are additionally represented as a single HGVS \u2018delins\u2019 variant. This allows for correct nomenclature and consequences to be ascribed to complex MNPs which are otherwise difficult to interpret.\r\n",
