Make sure have the `CXX` environment variable set as the same compiler as `which g++` returns (because some of the submodules use the compiler directed by the `CXX` variable while other ignore it). Also set the `BOOST_ROOT` variable to the root of BOOST which should already be compiled with the same compiler. Graphtyper is linked with BOOST dynamically, but other libraries statically.\n\nFor the purpose of demonstration, we assume you want to clone graphtyper to `~/git/graphtyper` and build it in `~/git/graphtyper/release-build`.\n\n```sh\nmkdir -p ~/git && cd ~/git\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/graphtyper.git graphtyper && cd graphtyper\nmkdir -p release-build && cd release-build\ncmake ..\nmake -j4 graphtyper # The 'j' argument specifies how many compilation threads to use, you can change this if you have more threads available. Also, the compilation will take awhile... consider getting coffee at this point.\nbin/graphtyper # Will run graphtyper for the very first time!\n```\nAnd that's all. If you are lucky enough to have administrative access, you can run `sudo make install` to install graphtyper system-wide.\n\n"

Boost.Serialization was replaced with Cereal. Note that any serialized graphs are not compatible between Boost.Serialization and Cereal so those will need to be reconstructed.\r\n * Moved from Travis CI to Github actions.\r\n * Improvements in 4-digit HLA genotyping. With these changes, when too many 4-digit HLA types are found in the population then they the most infrequent ones are merged.\r\n * clang-format and clang-tidy configs added.\r\n * Removal of all `system()` calls.\r\n * Optimization of work is split between threads.\r\n * C++ standard changed from C++11 to C++17. We therefore require a compiler that supports C++17 and compiles AVX512 code (GCC 7+ or Clang 10+). Note that these compilers is not required for running the graphtyper static binary.\r\n * Reworked how phase information is stored in initial discovery step to greatly reduce memory usage of that step.",

See #27 .\r\n - :open_file_folder: **/tmp** Temporary directory location can now be set with the $TMPDIR environment variable. See #26 .\r\n - :dart: Further adjustment of genotyping parameters which is mostly increasing precision of the SNP/indel calls.\r\n - :book: graphtyper learned to respect the $REF_CACHE environment variable when reading CRAMs. If you want to force using the input FASTA instead you need these options `--advanced --force_use_input_ref_for_cram_reading` when using the \"genotype\" subcommand.\r\n\r\n:bug: Bugfixes \r\n - Fixed a bug in `genotype_sv` which caused GraphTyper to mistakenly use reads with bad flags which could lead to segfault. See #28 .\r\n\r\n\r\nI am grateful for the feedback I have recieved. Thank you Brent Pedersen, Jean Monlong and others. Any further feedback welcome.",

        "description": "## Download release\r\n**[Linux 64bit binary](https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/graphtyper/releases/download/v2.1/graphtyper)**\r\n\r\nThe binary is statically linked for linux 64bit and should run without installing the dependencies. Before running the binary you should enable executable permissions\r\n```sh\r\nwget https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/graphtyper/releases/download/v2.1/graphtyper\r\nchmod a+x graphtyper\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\nMajor changes\r\n\r\n * :kiss: **KISS** Added new subcommand `genotype` which calls runs the recommended pipeline for calling SNP/indels. This makes is much more easier to run GraphTyper. bamShrink is now included in GraphTyper and does not need to be downloaded separately. Also, there is a new `genotype_sv` subcommand which calls input SVs using the recommended SV pipeline. If you want to run GraphTyper differently then the genotype command then of course all the old subcommands are still available. \r\n* :rocket: **Parallel input reading optimization** GraphTyper now supports reading multiple SAM/BAM/CRAM at the same in sorted order - this means that if the exact same read appears multiple times in the population it will only be aligned to the graph once and its alignment reused. In practice, this optimization slightly increases the speed of graphtyping on a single individual but for a 1000 individuals we see approximately 2x overall speedup. 1000 is the default maximum amount of files allowed to be open at the same time, but if you want to limit the number of open files you can do that using the `--max_files_open=N` option.\r\n* \ud83c\udfce **SIMD** GraphTyper now utilizes SIMD vectorization instructions such as SSE2, SSE4, and AVX. Availabity of these instructions are detected at runtime and used if available and do not require any special re-compiling.\r\n* \u270d\ufe0f **Overlapping variants** GraphTyper now allows reporting of overlapping variants and that is now the default representation. This also means there are now never reported complex variants, SNPs and indels. This feature can be turned off using the `--no_variant_overlapping` option to change to the old behaviour.\r\n* :wave: Removed two submodules: args and libStatGen. Thank you for your service.\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n * \ud83d\udc4d Several parameter changes resulting in more accurate SNP/indel variant calling.\r\n * :bug: Several rare bugs in variant discovery fixed. Most notably there was a bug fix that caused some false positive indels to be added to the graph (though in rare cases).",

        "description": "This version version greatly lowers Graphtyper's false discovery rate (FDR) and is able to discover more indels than previously. With fewer false variants, genotyping times and memory have been lowered.\r\n\r\nFull list of changes:\r\n* Graphtyper learned to natively discover from alignments from external aligners using the new \"discover\" subcommand.\r\n* Discovery model has been greatly improved, both lowering overall FDR and increasing indel recall rate.\r\n* Graphtyper learned a new subcommand \"discovery_vcf\" where that can create a disocvery VCF file from serialized variant maps. This removes any batch effects of calling in pools of samples.\r\n* Haplotype trimming is now more aggressive, removing any alleles with no confident carriers.\r\n* Graphtyper has started learning to genotype SVs (NOTE: experimental at the moment).\r\n* Graphtyper learned how to calculate more statistics when --stats option is given, in particular about variant SNP and indel candidates.\r\n* The \"vcf_break_down\" subcommand now makes sure that its output is normalized and sorted. With this change vt is no longer needed.\r\n* Graphtyper learned SV genotyping (experimental).\r\n* Most of the \"vcf_*\" subcommands now have the ability to print variants only in certain regions. Begin position is used to deteremine if variant should or should not be printed.\r\n* Removed .bis, .ter, etc. endings in variant IDs and use numbers only from now on.\r\n* Bugfix: In rare cases the alignment algorithm was not able to align all of the read even if it matched the graph.\r\n* Cleaned-up many unused files in the test directory.\r\n* Changed submodules from stations to paw.",
