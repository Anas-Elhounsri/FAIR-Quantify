        "value": "Installation\n============\n\n## Operating system\n\nThere is no restriction as far as I am aware of. Tested and working on Linux, macOS and Windows systems.\n\n(But Windows users will need extra configurations...)\n\n\n## Software environment\n\nHGTector is written in Python 3. One needs at least Python 3.6 to run the program. I recommend [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) for managing Python version and packages.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Option 1: Through Conda (recommended)\n\n```bash\nconda create -n hgtector python=3 pyyaml pandas matplotlib scikit-learn\nconda activate hgtector\npip install git+https://github.com/DittmarLab/HGTector.git\n```\n\n### Option 2: Native installation\n\nDownload this [repository](https://github.com/DittmarLab/HGTector/archive/master.zip). Unzip. Then execute:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nType `hgtector` to check if installation is successful, in which case command-line help information will be displayed on the screen.\n\nYou may now read [first run](1strun.md) and [second run](2ndrun.md) before proceeding with aligner and database installation.\n\n\n## Aligner\n\nOne may use choice of [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) or [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) for sequence homology search. If you have already installed them, make sure they are callable from the environment, or use command-line [arguments](search.md#Local-search-behaviors) to point the executables to HGTector. Alternatively, you may install them via Conda:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c bioconda diamond blast\n```\n\n\n## Database\n\nHGTector has a command `database` for automated database construction. It defaults to the **NCBI** RefSeq microbial genomes and taxonomy. Meanwhile, we also provide instructions for using **GTDB** and custom databases. See [details](database.md).\n\nA standard database built using the default protocol on 2019-10-21 is available for [download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qdnfgzdcjadlm4i/hgtdb_20191021.tar.xz?dl=0), together with [instruction](database.md#Manual-compiling) for compiling.\n\nA small, pre-compiled test database is also available for [download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/46v3uc708rvc5rc/ref107.tar.xz?dl=0).\n\n\n## Upgrade\n\nJust add `--upgrade` or `-U` to the pip command:\n\n```bash\npip install -U git+https://github.com/DittmarLab/HGTector.git\n```\n\nNote: You can only upgrade from HGTector 2.0b1 or above. You cannot upgrade from older versions, which were written in Perl.\n\n\n## Uninstallation\n\n```bash\npip uninstall hgtector\n```\n\nIf you no longer need the conda environment:\n\n```bash\nconda env remove -n hgtector --all\n```\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\nIf in the future some dependencies have changes that are not compatible with the current release of HGTector, the following \"safe\" command can be used to install the current versions of dependencies (note: DIAMOND version is too tricky to specify).\n\n```bash\nconda create -n hgtector -c bioconda python=3.7.7 pyyaml=5.3.1 pandas=1.0.3 matplotlib=3.1.3 scikit-learn=0.22.1 diamond blast=2.9.0\n```\n"
