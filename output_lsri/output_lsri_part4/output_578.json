        "value": "Forward and reverse reads were trimmed of their respective adapter sequences using fastxtoolkit/0.013. A minimum adapter alignment length of 10bp was required, and unknown (N) nucleotides were kept: `fastx_clipper -Q33 -n -M 10`\n\nTrimmed sequencing files from the BCG and sequencing control samples  were were blasted against a reference library using blast/2.6.0 with the following parameters:\n```\nblast -perc_identity 90 -word_size 9 -dust no -soft_masking false\n```\nFor sequencing libraries prepared from BCG tRNA, a reference library was created based on the 48 entries in the gtRNA database for Myocbacterium bovis BCG str. Pasteur_1173P2 (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb2/genomes/bacteria/Myco_bovi_BCG_Pasteur_1173P2_BCG_Pasteur_1173P2/Myco_bovi_BCG_Pasteur_1173P2_BCG_Pasteur_1173P2-gene-list.html). Sequences corresponding to duplicate tRNA genes (e.g. tRNA-Ala-TGC-1-2 and tRNA-Ile-GAT-1-2) and tRNA pseudogenes (tRNA-Ser-CGA-2-1) were removed to eliminate redundant entries and reduce the incidence of ambiguous or false positive matches. The terminal (3') CCA sequence was added to tRNA sequences where it is not genomically encoded.\nThe sequence for the 80-nt RNA oligo internal standard was added to the reference library. For the control samples, the sequences of the 5 synthetic RNA oligos was used to create a reference library, along with the 80-nt RNA oligo internal standard.\n\nFor each tRNA and control sample, forward and reverse reads were merged by integrating their start and end positions to generate new start and end positions that reflect their combined coverage using the python script `blastpair.py`. Multiple alignments were reduced by ranking all the alignments for a given read by their e-value and retaining only the alignment with the lowest e-value. Forward and reverse reads were required to match the same target. Paired reads that did not match the same target were discarded. Paired reads that mapped to multiple targets were stored in a separate file and not analyzed. These manipulations were carried out with the python script `cull.py`. Uniquely mapped reads were then tabulated and counted.\n\nFor the microRNA samples, the set of 963 miRNA sequences contained within the miRXplore Universal Reference product was combined with the sequence for the 80-nt RNA oligo standard was added to generate the reference library. In that analysis, \nthe number of exact sequencing reads that matched to the reference miRNA sequence in each trimmed sequencing file was determined with `fgrep`:\n```\nnumberReadsPerFile=$(fgrep $miRNA_sequence $trimmed_sequencing_file | wc -l)\n```\nThe read counts of the miRNAs were normalized to the summed counts for all detected miRNAs to obtain a \u201cnormalized read count\u201d. The summed counts of all detected miRNAs was also divided by 963, the total number of detected miRNAs, to obtain the \u201cexpected read count\u201d assuming all species were equimolar. The read ratio was calculated by dividing the normalized read count by the expected read count.\n"
