DExSI performs targeted automated metabolite identification, isotopologue mass (fractional labelling) and abundance determination and natural isotope abundance correction. DExSI provides a range of output options (i.e. tables, graphs and heatmaps) and is suitable for high throughput analyses. \nAs DExSI is designed to detect metabolites irrespective of the extent of isotopic labelling, this software may also be used to perform targeted analysis on unlabelled data sets.  \n \n"

Absolute quantitation can only be perfomed if an authentic standards mixture sample (ideally, three samples of known and varied amounts) is included in the data set.\n  \n  Data can be acquired in either SIM or SCAN mode.\n  \n  2.) **A DExSI _library_ file**  \n  This customised list is created in DExSI and comprises each metabolite of interest, and key parameters including retention time, isotopologue series (unlabelled to maximally labelled masses), and the chemical formula of the parental ion.\n  Both the chemical formula of the ion for quantitation and the maximum number of labelled atoms in the ion must be provided to perform natural isotope abundance correction and to calculate fractional labelling.\n  \n  _You will require a different library for each ionization (i.e. EI, NCI, PCI) and derivitization method, reflecting differences in the most suitable ion for quantitation for each metabolite resulting from these method changes._\n  \n  The use of retention time locking is recommended to minimise shifts in retention time between experiments, thereby limiting the need to modify the expected retention time in your library between experiments.  \n  \n  3.) **A DExSI _groups_ file**  \n  This defines the grouping of your samples (replicates by type and time point).\n  \n  4.) **A DExSI _standards_ file**  \n  This defines the name and amount of known standards in your known standard mixture, and is required for the absolute quantitation on metabolites. \n"
