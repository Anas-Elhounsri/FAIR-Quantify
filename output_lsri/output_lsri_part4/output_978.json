From this representation, NeuroMeasure offers the following additional features: \n1. Segmentation algorithms for isolating the skull for proper representation and registration of TMS Neuronavigation data\n2. Clustering operations for handling of repeated-measures TMS experiments\n3. Surface fitting operations for creating surface functions to characterize underlying motor cortex innervation of target muscles\n4. Static measurements of datasets such as center of gravity (COG), peak recorded value, total surface area of surface fit, and volume integration of the MEP amplitude function over the surface fit.\n5. Cursor position and amplitude \n6. User-selected reference point\n7. Comparison tools for directly comparing multiple TMS Neuronavigation datasets, and comparison of root mean square error (RMSE), receiver operator curve (ROC), and area under curve (AUC) measurements between datasets\n8. Tools for data exportation and image exportation for publication\n \n"
