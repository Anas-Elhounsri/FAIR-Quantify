Annotated gene sets (referred to as 'signatures') are incorporated so that features in the projections can be understood in relation to the biological processes they might represent.  FastProject provides a novel method of scoring each cell against a gene signature so as to minimize the effect of missed transcripts as well as a method to rank signature-projection pairings so that meaningful associations can be quickly identified. Additionally, FastProject is written with a modular architecture and designed to serve as a platform for incorporating and comparing new projection methods and gene selection algorithms. \n"
