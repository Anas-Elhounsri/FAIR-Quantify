Let us say that `reactivity` represents one such data frame, that there are 3 samples of each group and that the user needs to search for a minimum length of 11 nt. Note that this is the default value for this parameter. For other parameters that can be specified, refer the manual. Unless specified, `dStruct` assumes that the user intends to run the analysis with default settings. _De novo_ discovery of differential regions can be done by executing the following command.\n\n`dStruct(reactivity, reps_A = 3, reps_B = 3, min_length = 11)`\n\nReactivities for all transcripts can be stored together in a list object, say `rlist`, with one data frame for each transcript. All the list elements must have unique names. In this case,  _de novo_ discovery can be done simultaneously for all transcripts.\n\n`dStructome(rlist, reps_A = 3, reps_B = 3, min_length = 11)`\n\nUsers can specify the number of cores to be used by `dStructome` for parallel processing of transcripts.\n\nFor guided discovery, data frame with reactivities should contain only information for regions of interest. There should be a separate data frame for each region. Let one such data frame be `reac_region1`. If there are say, 3 samples of each group, guided discovery can be performed as follows.\n\n`dStruct.guided(reac_region1, reps_A = 3, reps_B = 3)`\n\nAll the data frames can also be combined in a single list object, say `rlist`. Then, guided discovery could be done in parallel for all regions using the following command.\n\n`dStructome(rlist, reps_A = 3, reps_B = 3, method = \"guided\")`\n\nFor other options available in dStruct package, refer the dStruct manual or email the contributors.\n"
