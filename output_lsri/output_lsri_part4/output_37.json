The idea is that viable cells must share similar geometrical properties and hence their scattering profile should be similar. We thus identify debris as cells which appear as outliers in the scattering profile of the population. \n\nEvery signal measured by the FACS machine is just an electrical signal that creates an analog impulse in the detectors. This impulse is then represented by a number by considering the value of the highest point, the area under the curve of the impulse or the width of the impulse. Of these, only the width and the height are independent and since a priori for the scattering we don't have any reason to privilege one or the other, we consider both of them.\n\nIn the end, the scattering profile is measured by four signals, two coming from the forward scattering (height and width) and the corresponding two from the side scattering. To identify outliers, we perform a 4D mixture of a Gaussian (representing the main cloud of scattering points from viable cells) and a uniform distribution (representing the outliers). The mixture gives us the posterior probability for each cell to come from the gaussian or from the uniform and we discard all the cells whose posterior is lower than a threshold that has to be set by the user (e.g. 0.5).\n"

        "value": "To start the preprocessing it is enough to call the function \n```\nanalyse_raw(.dirs, \n            .data2preproc, \n            .filter_preproc_namer = (function(.d) sub(\"fcs$\", \"RData\", .d)), \n            .f_par, \n            .force = FALSE, \n            .preproc_func = NULL) \n```\nYou are encouraged to look at the function documentation to understand all the parameters it depends on. The most important ones are \n\n* *.dirs*: a vector containing all the directories with the FCS files. using our CSV file, this is just *pl_nfo$dir*.\n* *data2preproc* a function that takes the name of a directory containing the FCM files and returns the name of the directory where to store the preprocessed files.\n* *.f_par*: the list containing the parameters of the algorithm.\n* *.force*: if some files have already been preprocessed, should we force the algorithm to preprocess them again?\n\nWhat the function does is to loop over all the directories and to check for the FCM files that must be filtered according to the scattering profile. For each file, the result is written in a Rdata file in the directory specified by *.data2preproc*.\n\nFor our example we would write\n```\nprocessed <- analyse_raw(pl_info$dir, data2preproc, .f_par=f_par)\n```\n\n\\emph{Processed} is a dataframe containing different summary statistics of the populations of cells.\n"
