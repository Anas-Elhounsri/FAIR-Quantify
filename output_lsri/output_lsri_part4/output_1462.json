        "value": "* 1 April 2019: New release ([v1.5](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.5)) featuring:\n   * **Noise parameter estimation:** Changed noise parameter estimation so that all variation types (except nested) are now used. This allows BayesTyper to run on variant sets containing few or even no SNVs. In addition, the minimum requirement on the number of variants needed for noise estimation have been removed and replaced with a warning.\n   * **Noise genotyping mode:** Added new genotyping mode (`--noise-genotyping`) where noise parameters and genotypes are estimated jointly instead of sequentially. This allows for uncertainty in the noise estimates to be directly propagated into the genotype posteriors. For larger genomes the noise estimates are generally fairly stable, however for smaller genomes with few variants this is often not the case. Also, all variants even nested are used for noise estimation in this mode. Note, that this mode will in most cases be slower and require more memory than the default.\n   * **Seeding and threading:** Fixed seeding so that identical results (within floating-point error) are attained between different runs independently of the number of threads used. Before the same number of threads were needed in order to get identical results using the same seed.\n   * **Genotype quality:** Added genotype quality (GQ) as a sample attribute to the `bayesTyper genotype` output. The quality is calculated from the maximum genotype posterior probability (GPP) and is Phred-scaled.   \n   * **Filters:** Removed the `--min-homozygote-genotypes` filter from `bayesTyper genotype`. Due to several improvements to BayesTyper over the last couple of releases this filter is not as important as it used to be. Note, that it is still possible to apply the filter using `bayesTyperTools filter`.\n   * **Haplotype option:** Renamed the option for setting the maximum number of haplotype candidates per sample to `--max-number-of-sample-haplotypes` and increased its default value to 32. A higher value has been shown to give better results when genotyping a small number of samples. Note, that this increase might result in longer computation time especially for more complex variant clusters. \n   * **Prior option:** Changed the default parameters of the gamma distributed noise rate prior (`--noise-rate-prior`) to better reflect the expected Illumina error rate. \n   * **Insertion alleles:** Added support for insertions in `bayesTyperTools convertAllele`. The sequences stored in the variant attributes SEQ or SVINSSEQ are now used as the inserted sequence for \\<INS\\> alleles. In addition, a fasta file containing the inserted sequences can be given with \\>\"name\" matching \\<\"name\"\\>. Furthermore, support for partial insertions (Manta output) where the center and length is unknown has been added.\n   * **Scripts:** Removed `addMaxGenotypePosterior` since it is no longer relevant now that genotype qualities are calculated during genotyping. Added `filterAlleleCallsetOrigin` script that can filter alleles based on their origin (ACO).\n   * **General:** Made smaller improvements to the inference algorithm. Converted some common asserts related to input data to more readable error messages.  \n* 28 January 2019: Patch ([v1.4.1](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4.1))\n    * Updating to this patch is highly recommended since it fixes a bug introduced in [v1.4](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4) that resulted in `bayesTyper genotype` occasionally crashing on larger datasets (see [release notes](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4.1)). \n* 18 October 2018: New release ([v1.4](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4)) featuring:\n    * **Sparsity estimation**: Fixed bug when estimating the sparsity parameter used for the population prior. This fix should result in better estimates for complex clusters.\n    * **Ploidy input file**: The ploidy of each chromosome for each gender (female and male) can now be specified using `--chromosome-ploidy-file` in *bayesTyper genotype*. Ploidy levels 0, 1 (haploid) and 2 (diploid) are supported. Human ploidy levels are assumed if no file is given (see [wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-on-non-human-data) for more details).\n    * **Genomic parameter estimation**: Genomic parameters are now estimated using either haploid or diploid k-mers. The ploidy level with the highest number of informative k-mers is used for estimation.\n    * **Noise parameter estimation**: Noise parameters are now estimated using SNVs across all supported ploidy levels. In addition, SNVs in clusters are now also used in parameter estimation.\n    * **Error handling**: Incorrect inputs now produces more informative error messaging.\n \n"

This fix should result in better estimates for complex clusters.\r\n* **Ploidy input file**: The ploidy of each chromosome for each gender (female and male) can now be specified using `--chromosome-ploidy-file` in *bayesTyper genotype*. Ploidy levels 0, 1 (haploid) and 2 (diploid) are supported. Human ploidy levels are assumed if no file is given (see [wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-on-non-human-data) for more details).\r\n* **Genomic parameter estimation**: Genomic parameters are now estimated using either haploid or diploid k-mers. The ploidy level with the highest number of informative k-mers is used for estimation.\r\n* **Noise parameter estimation**: Noise parameters are now estimated using SNVs across all supported ploidy levels. In addition, SNVs in clusters are now also used in parameter estimation. \r\n* **Error handling**: Incorrect inputs now produces more informative error messaging.\r\n",

        "description": "Major overhaul of BayesTyper. Important new features:\r\n* **New interface:** bayesTyper has been refactored into `BayesTyper cluster` and `BayesTyper genotype`. The *cluster* part partitions the variants into *units* that can then be *genotyped*.  Please refer to the new readme for details on how to update your pipeline.\r\n* **Much reduced memory:** Only graphs and k-mers for a single unit need to reside in memory at the same time; the rest remains on disk. A bloom filter stores information about k-mers shared across units.  This construct ensures that *memory usage is (almost) independent of the number of candidate variants*.\r\n* **Cluster support:** Each unit can be genotyped independently and hence distributed across nodes on a cluster followed by simple concatenation of the unit vcf files (e.g. using `bcftools concat`).\r\n* **Simultaneous genotyping and filtering:** No need to run `bayesTyperTools filter`. Hard filters are now applied up front by `bayesTyper genotype`. Genotypes can still be refiltered using `bayesTyperTools filter` after genotyping if necessary.\r\n* **Parallel read bloom generation:** `bayesTyperTools makeBloom` can now use multiple threads (and  scales very well with the number of threads).\r\n* **snakemake workflow:** We have added an example *snakemake* workflow to the repo - this can orchestrate the entire pipeline straight from BAM(s) over variant candidates to final genotypes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n",

Instead, users can combine the variant discovery strategies suitable for their study as it will depend on the study design (e.g. coverage, number of samples etc.) as well as the available resources.\n\nBelow we outline an example strategy, where candiates are obtained using\n* *GATK-HaplotypeCaller* (without all the pre-processing of alignments and post-processing of variants)\n* *Platypus*\n* *Manta*\n* The [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) (part of the BayesTyper data bundle, see [Installation](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper#installation))\n\nThe complete workflow (i.e. BAM(s) to genotypes) outlined below is further provided as a [snakemake workflow](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/tree/master/workflows) for easy deployment of BayesTyper. Please refer to the [snakemake wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-using-snakemake) for detailed instructions on how to set up and execute the workflow on your data.\n\n**Important:** Please note that it is currently only possible to genotype 30 samples at the time using *BayesTyper*. To run more samples, please execute *BayesTyper* in batches as described in the [batching wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Executing-BayesTyper-on-sample-batches). Batching is currently not supported by the *snakemake* workflow - please let us know if you require this feature by filing a [feature request](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/issues).\n\n**Important:** Bayestyper supports uncompressed and gzip compressed vcf files. Please note that bgzip compression is currently **not** supported.\n\n**Important:** If you intend to genotype other organisms than human, please refer to the [other organism wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-on-other-organisms) for more information. \n\n### 1. Generation of variant candidates ###\nStarting from a set of indexed, aligned reads (obtained e.g. using *BWA-MEM*):\n\n1. For each sample, run [*HaplotypeCaller*](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_haplotypecaller_HaplotypeCaller.php) to get standard mapping-based candidates\n    * Running Base Quality Recalibration or doing joint genotyping is **not** required\n    * Faster alternative: [*Freebayes*](https://github.com/ekg/freebayes)\n    \n2. For each sample, run [*Platypus*](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/platypus) to identify small and medium sized variants\n\n3. For each sample, run [*Manta*](https://github.com/Illumina/manta) to identify candidates by *de novo* local assembly (important for detecting larger deletions and insertions). Convert allele IDs (e.g. \\<DEL\\>) in the Manta output to sequences using `bayesTyperTools convertAllele`\n\n4. For each caller, left-align and normalize variants using `bcftools norm` ([*bcftools*](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools))\n\n5. Combine variants across *all* samples, callers and the [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) using `bayesTyperTools combine -v GATK:<gatk_sample1>.vcf,GATK:<gatk_sample2>.vcf,PLATYPUS:<platypus_sample1>.vcf,PLATYPUS:<platypus_sample2>.vcf,MANTA:<manta_sample1>.vcf,...,prior:<prior>.vcf -o <candiate_variants_prefix> -z`\n   * **Note:** The source tag before the colon (e.g. GATK) only serves to identify the origin of the calls in the final callset - it can take any value.\n   * **Important:** `bayesTyperTools combine` requires the vcf header to contain contig entries (e.g.`##contig=<ID=8,length=146364022>`) for all reference sequences containing variants in the vcf; the contigs further need to appear in the same order in the header and for the variant entries.\n\n### 2. Genotyping based on variant candidates ###\n\n1. Count k-mers\n   1. Run [KMC3](https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC) on each sample (set k=55 using `-k55` and include singleton k-mers using `-ci1`)\n      * **Note:** Default is fq(.gz) input - bam input is enabled using `-fbam`.\n      * **Important:** If the reads are in bam format, make sure the file also contains the unmapped reads.   \n   2. Create a read k-mer bloom filter for each sample from the KMC3 output using `bayesTyperTools makeBloom -k <kmc_output_prefix> -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Important:** The resulting bloom filter (*<sample_id>.bloomMeta* and *<sample_id>.bloomData*) and the KMC3 output (*<sample_id>.kmc_pre* and *<sample_id>.kmc_suf*) must reside in the same directory and have the same prefix\n\n2. Identify variant clusters: `bayesTyper cluster -v <candiate_variants_prefix>.vcf.gz -s <samples>.tsv -g <ref_build>_canon.fa -d <ref_build>_decoy.fa -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Note:** This partitions the candidate variants into units written to separate directories (*bayestyper_unit_1*, *bayestyper_unit_2*, ...) - each containing between 5M and 10M variants. These can be genotyped independently e.g. on a cluster (supported by the [snakemake workflow](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/tree/master/workflows)) followed by a simple concatenation operation using `bcftools concat` (see below).\n      * **Important:** The `<samples>.tsv` file should contain one sample per row with columns *<sample_id>, \\<sex> and <kmc_output_prefix>* and no header ([example](http://people.binf.ku.dk/~lassemaretty/bayesTyper/bt_sample_example.tsv)).\n      * **Important:** Data that is common to all units and necessary for genotyping is written to the *bayestyper_cluster_data* directory.\n      * **Note:** Human reference files (canon/decoy) are provided in the BayesTyper data bundle (see [Installation](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper#installation)).\n\n3. Genotype variant clusters: `bayesTyper genotype -v bayestyper_unit_<unit_id>/variant_clusters.bin -c bayestyper_cluster_data -s <samples>.tsv -g <ref_build>_canon.fa -d <ref_build>_decoy.fa -o bayestyper_unit_<unit_id>/bayestyper -z -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Note:** The genotype command also applies the default BayesTyper hard-filters by setting the variant FILTER status and the sample specific allele filter (SAF) format attribute. Please refer to the [filter wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Filtering) for information about the filters used, how to changes the defaults up front and how to refilter the data after running the genotyping step.\n      * **Important:** The filtering procedure only filters the genotypes (\"./.\") and hence, downstream tools **should prefilter on the variant quality and FILTER==\\\"PASS\\\"** (e.g. using [*bcftools*](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools)) to obtain the filtered calls.\n\n4. Concatenate units using [*bcftools*](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools): `bcftools concat -O z -o <output_prefix>.vcf.gz bayestyper_unit_1/bayestyper.vcf.gz bayestyper_unit_2/bayestyper.vcf.gz ...`\n    * **Important:** Unit arguments to bcftools should be in ascending order (unit_1 unit_2 ...) for the output to be properly sorted\n\n## Computational requirements ##\n\n|Number of samples|Coverage|Number of variant alleles|Max allele length (nts)|Number of threads|Wall time (h, single node)|Wall time (h, multiple nodes)\\*|Max memory (GB)|\n|-|---|-----|-------|--|-|-|--|\n|3|13x|21.4M|500,000|28|5-6|2-3|41|\n|3|13x|64.4M|500,000|28|17-18|4-5|42|\n|13|50x|11.7M|10,000|28|31-32|16-17|66|\n|13|50x|61.1M|10,000|28|92-93|15-16|62|\n\n\\* `bayesTyper genotype` can be distributed across nodes on a cluster - between 2 and 11 nodes were used in this benchmark.\n\nThe time estimates are for running `bayesTyper cluster` and `bayesTyper genotype` only. Expect <1h combined run-time per sample for counting k-mers by *KMC3* and bloom filter creation by *bayesTyperTools*.

This allows BayesTyper to run on variant sets containing few or even no SNVs. In addition, the minimum requirement on the number of variants needed for noise estimation have been removed and replaced with a warning.\n   * **Noise genotyping mode:** Added new genotyping mode (`--noise-genotyping`) where noise parameters and genotypes are estimated jointly instead of sequentially. This allows for uncertainty in the noise estimates to be directly propagated into the genotype posteriors. For larger genomes the noise estimates are generally fairly stable, however for smaller genomes with few variants this is often not the case. Also, all variants even nested are used for noise estimation in this mode. Note, that this mode will in most cases be slower and require more memory than the default.\n   * **Seeding and threading:** Fixed seeding so that identical results (within floating-point error) are attained between different runs independently of the number of threads used. Before the same number of threads were needed in order to get identical results using the same seed.\n   * **Genotype quality:** Added genotype quality (GQ) as a sample attribute to the `bayesTyper genotype` output. The quality is calculated from the maximum genotype posterior probability (GPP) and is Phred-scaled.   \n   * **Filters:** Removed the `--min-homozygote-genotypes` filter from `bayesTyper genotype`. Due to several improvements to BayesTyper over the last couple of releases this filter is not as important as it used to be. Note, that it is still possible to apply the filter using `bayesTyperTools filter`.\n   * **Haplotype option:** Renamed the option for setting the maximum number of haplotype candidates per sample to `--max-number-of-sample-haplotypes` and increased its default value to 32. A higher value has been shown to give better results when genotyping a small number of samples. Note, that this increase might result in longer computation time especially for more complex variant clusters. \n   * **Prior option:** Changed the default parameters of the gamma distributed noise rate prior (`--noise-rate-prior`) to better reflect the expected Illumina error rate. \n   * **Insertion alleles:** Added support for insertions in `bayesTyperTools convertAllele`. The sequences stored in the variant attributes SEQ or SVINSSEQ are now used as the inserted sequence for \\<INS\\> alleles. In addition, a fasta file containing the inserted sequences can be given with \\>\"name\" matching \\<\"name\"\\>. Furthermore, support for partial insertions (Manta output) where the center and length is unknown has been added.\n   * **Scripts:** Removed `addMaxGenotypePosterior` since it is no longer relevant now that genotype qualities are calculated during genotyping. Added `filterAlleleCallsetOrigin` script that can filter alleles based on their origin (ACO).\n   * **General:** Made smaller improvements to the inference algorithm. Converted some common asserts related to input data to more readable error messages. \n\n* 28 January 2019: Patch ([v1.4.1](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4.1))\n    * Updating to this patch is highly recommended since it fixes a bug introduced in [v1.4](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4) that resulted in `bayesTyper genotype` occasionally crashing on larger datasets (see [release notes](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4.1)).\n\n* 18 October 2018: New release ([v1.4](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4)) featuring:\n    * **Sparsity estimation**: Fixed bug when estimating the sparsity parameter used for the population prior. This fix should result in better estimates for complex clusters.\n    * **Ploidy input file**: The ploidy of each chromosome for each gender (female and male) can now be specified using `--chromosome-ploidy-file` in *bayesTyper genotype*. Ploidy levels 0, 1 (haploid) and 2 (diploid) are supported. Human ploidy levels are assumed if no file is given (see [wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-on-non-human-data) for more details).\n    * **Genomic parameter estimation**: Genomic parameters are now estimated using either haploid or diploid k-mers. The ploidy level with the highest number of informative k-mers is used for estimation.\n    * **Noise parameter estimation**: Noise parameters are now estimated using SNVs across all supported ploidy levels. In addition, SNVs in clusters are now also used in parameter estimation.\n    * **Error handling**: Incorrect inputs now produces more informative error messaging.\n\n## Why should I use BayesTyper? ##\n### Short explanation ###\nBecause it allows you to obtain accurate genotypes spanning from SNVs/short indels to complex structural variants and hence provides a more complete picture of the genome as compared with standard methods - without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n### Detailed explanation ###\nStandard methods for genotyping (e.g. *GATK-HaplotypeCaller*, *Platypus* and *Freebayes*) start from an alignment of reads (e.g. by *BWA-MEM*) and then\n1. Call candidate variants.\n2. Perform *local* realignment of reads anchored to a particular variable region to candidate variant haplotypes.\n3. Estimate genotypes (and thus final variant calls).\n\nThis approach can result in a bias towards the reference sequence since reads informative for a particular variant may have been left either unaligned (because of too large an edit distance to the reference) or have aligned better elsewhere in the reference.\n\nThe variant graph approach used by BayesTyper ensures that the resulting calls are not biased towards the reference sequence by effectively realigning *all* reads (or more specifically their k-mers) when genotyping candidate variants. In our recent [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0145-5), we show how this approach significantly improves both sensitivity and genotyping accuracy for most variant types - especially non-SNVs (please see citation below).\n\n## Installation ##\n1. Download the latest static Linux x86_64 build (k=55) found under [releases](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/latest).\n    * To build from source, please refer to the [build wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Building-BayesTyper-from-source) for detailed build instructions. Note that the k-mer size is determined compile time. Hence, if you want k \u2260 55 you need to compile it yourself (or post a [feature request](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/issues) and we will see what we can do).\n\n2. Download the BayesTyper human data bundle ([GRCh37](http://people.binf.ku.dk/~lassemaretty/bayesTyper/bayestyper_GRCh37_bundle.tar.gz) and [GRCh38](http://people.binf.ku.dk/~lassemaretty/bayesTyper/bayestyper_GRCh38_bundle.tar.gz)) containing reference sequences preprocessed for BayesTyper (i.e. canonical and decoy chromosomes) together with a reference matched [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) database.\n\n## Usage ##\nThe BayesTyper genotyping process occurs in two stages:\n1. Generation of variant candidates (using other tools)\n2. Genotyping based on variant candidates (using *BayesTyper*)\n\nAs indicated, BayesTyper **does not** find candidate variants on its own. Instead, users can combine the variant discovery strategies suitable for their study as it will depend on the study design (e.g. coverage, number of samples etc.) as well as the available resources.\n\nBelow we outline an example strategy, where candiates are obtained using\n* *GATK-HaplotypeCaller* (without all the pre-processing of alignments and post-processing of variants)\n* *Platypus*\n* *Manta*\n* The [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) (part of the BayesTyper data bundle, see [Installation](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper#installation))\n\nThe complete workflow (i.e. BAM(s) to genotypes) outlined below is further provided as a [snakemake workflow](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/tree/master/workflows) for easy deployment of BayesTyper. Please refer to the [snakemake wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-using-snakemake) for detailed instructions on how to set up and execute the workflow on your data.\n\n**Important:** Please note that it is currently only possible to genotype 30 samples at the time using *BayesTyper*. To run more samples, please execute *BayesTyper* in batches as described in the [batching wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Executing-BayesTyper-on-sample-batches). Batching is currently not supported by the *snakemake* workflow - please let us know if you require this feature by filing a [feature request](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/issues).\n\n**Important:** Bayestyper supports uncompressed and gzip compressed vcf files. Please note that bgzip compression is currently **not** supported.\n\n**Important:** If you intend to genotype other organisms than human, please refer to the [other organism wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-on-other-organisms) for more information. \n\n### 1. Generation of variant candidates ###\nStarting from a set of indexed, aligned reads (obtained e.g. using *BWA-MEM*):\n\n1. For each sample, run [*HaplotypeCaller*](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_haplotypecaller_HaplotypeCaller.php) to get standard mapping-based candidates\n    * Running Base Quality Recalibration or doing joint genotyping is **not** required\n    * Faster alternative: [*Freebayes*](https://github.com/ekg/freebayes)\n    \n2. For each sample, run [*Platypus*](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/platypus) to identify small and medium sized variants\n\n3. For each sample, run [*Manta*](https://github.com/Illumina/manta) to identify candidates by *de novo* local assembly (important for detecting larger deletions and insertions). Convert allele IDs (e.g. \\<DEL\\>) in the Manta output to sequences using `bayesTyperTools convertAllele`\n\n4. For each caller, left-align and normalize variants using `bcftools norm` ([*bcftools*](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools))\n\n5. Combine variants across *all* samples, callers and the [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) using `bayesTyperTools combine -v GATK:<gatk_sample1>.vcf,GATK:<gatk_sample2>.vcf,PLATYPUS:<platypus_sample1>.vcf,PLATYPUS:<platypus_sample2>.vcf,MANTA:<manta_sample1>.vcf,...,prior:<prior>.vcf -o <candiate_variants_prefix> -z`\n   * **Note:** The source tag before the colon (e.g. GATK) only serves to identify the origin of the calls in the final callset - it can take any value.\n   * **Important:** `bayesTyperTools combine` requires the vcf header to contain contig entries (e.g.`##contig=<ID=8,length=146364022>`) for all reference sequences containing variants in the vcf; the contigs further need to appear in the same order in the header and for the variant entries.\n\n### 2. Genotyping based on variant candidates ###\n\n1. Count k-mers\n   1. Run [KMC3](https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC) on each sample (set k=55 using `-k55` and include singleton k-mers using `-ci1`)\n      * **Note:** Default is fq(.gz) input - bam input is enabled using `-fbam`.\n      * **Important:** If the reads are in bam format, make sure the file also contains the unmapped reads.   \n   2. Create a read k-mer bloom filter for each sample from the KMC3 output using `bayesTyperTools makeBloom -k <kmc_output_prefix> -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Important:** The resulting bloom filter (*<sample_id>.bloomMeta* and *<sample_id>.bloomData*) and the KMC3 output (*<sample_id>.kmc_pre* and *<sample_id>.kmc_suf*) must reside in the same directory and have the same prefix\n\n2. Identify variant clusters: `bayesTyper cluster -v <candiate_variants_prefix>.vcf.gz -s <samples>.tsv -g <ref_build>_canon.fa -d <ref_build>_decoy.fa -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Note:** This partitions the candidate variants into units written to separate directories (*bayestyper_unit_1*, *bayestyper_unit_2*, ...) - each containing between 5M and 10M variants. These can be genotyped independently e.g. on a cluster (supported by the [snakemake workflow](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/tree/master/workflows)) followed by a simple concatenation operation using `bcftools concat` (see below).\n      * **Important:** The `<samples>.tsv` file should contain one sample per row with columns *<sample_id>, \\<sex> and <kmc_output_prefix>* and no header ([example](http://people.binf.ku.dk/~lassemaretty/bayesTyper/bt_sample_example.tsv)).\n      * **Important:** Data that is common to all units and necessary for genotyping is written to the *bayestyper_cluster_data* directory.\n      * **Note:** Human reference files (canon/decoy) are provided in the BayesTyper data bundle (see [Installation](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper#installation)).\n\n3. Genotype variant clusters: `bayesTyper genotype -v bayestyper_unit_<unit_id>/variant_clusters.bin -c bayestyper_cluster_data -s <samples>.tsv -g <ref_build>_canon.fa -d <ref_build>_decoy.fa -o bayestyper_unit_<unit_id>/bayestyper -z -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Note:** The genotype command also applies the default BayesTyper hard-filters by setting the variant FILTER status and the sample specific allele filter (SAF) format attribute.

Added `filterAlleleCallsetOrigin` script that can filter alleles based on their origin (ACO).\n   * **General:** Made smaller improvements to the inference algorithm. Converted some common asserts related to input data to more readable error messages. \n\n* 28 January 2019: Patch ([v1.4.1](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4.1))\n    * Updating to this patch is highly recommended since it fixes a bug introduced in [v1.4](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4) that resulted in `bayesTyper genotype` occasionally crashing on larger datasets (see [release notes](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4.1)).\n\n* 18 October 2018: New release ([v1.4](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/tag/v1.4)) featuring:\n    * **Sparsity estimation**: Fixed bug when estimating the sparsity parameter used for the population prior. This fix should result in better estimates for complex clusters.\n    * **Ploidy input file**: The ploidy of each chromosome for each gender (female and male) can now be specified using `--chromosome-ploidy-file` in *bayesTyper genotype*. Ploidy levels 0, 1 (haploid) and 2 (diploid) are supported. Human ploidy levels are assumed if no file is given (see [wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-on-non-human-data) for more details).\n    * **Genomic parameter estimation**: Genomic parameters are now estimated using either haploid or diploid k-mers. The ploidy level with the highest number of informative k-mers is used for estimation.\n    * **Noise parameter estimation**: Noise parameters are now estimated using SNVs across all supported ploidy levels. In addition, SNVs in clusters are now also used in parameter estimation.\n    * **Error handling**: Incorrect inputs now produces more informative error messaging.\n\n## Why should I use BayesTyper? ##\n### Short explanation ###\nBecause it allows you to obtain accurate genotypes spanning from SNVs/short indels to complex structural variants and hence provides a more complete picture of the genome as compared with standard methods - without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n### Detailed explanation ###\nStandard methods for genotyping (e.g. *GATK-HaplotypeCaller*, *Platypus* and *Freebayes*) start from an alignment of reads (e.g. by *BWA-MEM*) and then\n1. Call candidate variants.\n2. Perform *local* realignment of reads anchored to a particular variable region to candidate variant haplotypes.\n3. Estimate genotypes (and thus final variant calls).\n\nThis approach can result in a bias towards the reference sequence since reads informative for a particular variant may have been left either unaligned (because of too large an edit distance to the reference) or have aligned better elsewhere in the reference.\n\nThe variant graph approach used by BayesTyper ensures that the resulting calls are not biased towards the reference sequence by effectively realigning *all* reads (or more specifically their k-mers) when genotyping candidate variants. In our recent [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0145-5), we show how this approach significantly improves both sensitivity and genotyping accuracy for most variant types - especially non-SNVs (please see citation below).\n\n## Installation ##\n1. Download the latest static Linux x86_64 build (k=55) found under [releases](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/releases/latest).\n    * To build from source, please refer to the [build wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Building-BayesTyper-from-source) for detailed build instructions. Note that the k-mer size is determined compile time. Hence, if you want k \u2260 55 you need to compile it yourself (or post a [feature request](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/issues) and we will see what we can do).\n\n2. Download the BayesTyper human data bundle ([GRCh37](http://people.binf.ku.dk/~lassemaretty/bayesTyper/bayestyper_GRCh37_bundle.tar.gz) and [GRCh38](http://people.binf.ku.dk/~lassemaretty/bayesTyper/bayestyper_GRCh38_bundle.tar.gz)) containing reference sequences preprocessed for BayesTyper (i.e. canonical and decoy chromosomes) together with a reference matched [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) database.\n\n## Usage ##\nThe BayesTyper genotyping process occurs in two stages:\n1. Generation of variant candidates (using other tools)\n2. Genotyping based on variant candidates (using *BayesTyper*)\n\nAs indicated, BayesTyper **does not** find candidate variants on its own. Instead, users can combine the variant discovery strategies suitable for their study as it will depend on the study design (e.g. coverage, number of samples etc.) as well as the available resources.\n\nBelow we outline an example strategy, where candiates are obtained using\n* *GATK-HaplotypeCaller* (without all the pre-processing of alignments and post-processing of variants)\n* *Platypus*\n* *Manta*\n* The [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) (part of the BayesTyper data bundle, see [Installation](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper#installation))\n\nThe complete workflow (i.e. BAM(s) to genotypes) outlined below is further provided as a [snakemake workflow](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/tree/master/workflows) for easy deployment of BayesTyper. Please refer to the [snakemake wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-using-snakemake) for detailed instructions on how to set up and execute the workflow on your data.\n\n**Important:** Please note that it is currently only possible to genotype 30 samples at the time using *BayesTyper*. To run more samples, please execute *BayesTyper* in batches as described in the [batching wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Executing-BayesTyper-on-sample-batches). Batching is currently not supported by the *snakemake* workflow - please let us know if you require this feature by filing a [feature request](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/issues).\n\n**Important:** Bayestyper supports uncompressed and gzip compressed vcf files. Please note that bgzip compression is currently **not** supported.\n\n**Important:** If you intend to genotype other organisms than human, please refer to the [other organism wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Running-BayesTyper-on-other-organisms) for more information. \n\n### 1. Generation of variant candidates ###\nStarting from a set of indexed, aligned reads (obtained e.g. using *BWA-MEM*):\n\n1. For each sample, run [*HaplotypeCaller*](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_haplotypecaller_HaplotypeCaller.php) to get standard mapping-based candidates\n    * Running Base Quality Recalibration or doing joint genotyping is **not** required\n    * Faster alternative: [*Freebayes*](https://github.com/ekg/freebayes)\n    \n2. For each sample, run [*Platypus*](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/platypus) to identify small and medium sized variants\n\n3. For each sample, run [*Manta*](https://github.com/Illumina/manta) to identify candidates by *de novo* local assembly (important for detecting larger deletions and insertions). Convert allele IDs (e.g. \\<DEL\\>) in the Manta output to sequences using `bayesTyperTools convertAllele`\n\n4. For each caller, left-align and normalize variants using `bcftools norm` ([*bcftools*](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools))\n\n5. Combine variants across *all* samples, callers and the [variation prior](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Variation-prior) using `bayesTyperTools combine -v GATK:<gatk_sample1>.vcf,GATK:<gatk_sample2>.vcf,PLATYPUS:<platypus_sample1>.vcf,PLATYPUS:<platypus_sample2>.vcf,MANTA:<manta_sample1>.vcf,...,prior:<prior>.vcf -o <candiate_variants_prefix> -z`\n   * **Note:** The source tag before the colon (e.g. GATK) only serves to identify the origin of the calls in the final callset - it can take any value.\n   * **Important:** `bayesTyperTools combine` requires the vcf header to contain contig entries (e.g.`##contig=<ID=8,length=146364022>`) for all reference sequences containing variants in the vcf; the contigs further need to appear in the same order in the header and for the variant entries.\n\n### 2. Genotyping based on variant candidates ###\n\n1. Count k-mers\n   1. Run [KMC3](https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC) on each sample (set k=55 using `-k55` and include singleton k-mers using `-ci1`)\n      * **Note:** Default is fq(.gz) input - bam input is enabled using `-fbam`.\n      * **Important:** If the reads are in bam format, make sure the file also contains the unmapped reads.   \n   2. Create a read k-mer bloom filter for each sample from the KMC3 output using `bayesTyperTools makeBloom -k <kmc_output_prefix> -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Important:** The resulting bloom filter (*<sample_id>.bloomMeta* and *<sample_id>.bloomData*) and the KMC3 output (*<sample_id>.kmc_pre* and *<sample_id>.kmc_suf*) must reside in the same directory and have the same prefix\n\n2. Identify variant clusters: `bayesTyper cluster -v <candiate_variants_prefix>.vcf.gz -s <samples>.tsv -g <ref_build>_canon.fa -d <ref_build>_decoy.fa -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Note:** This partitions the candidate variants into units written to separate directories (*bayestyper_unit_1*, *bayestyper_unit_2*, ...) - each containing between 5M and 10M variants. These can be genotyped independently e.g. on a cluster (supported by the [snakemake workflow](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/tree/master/workflows)) followed by a simple concatenation operation using `bcftools concat` (see below).\n      * **Important:** The `<samples>.tsv` file should contain one sample per row with columns *<sample_id>, \\<sex> and <kmc_output_prefix>* and no header ([example](http://people.binf.ku.dk/~lassemaretty/bayesTyper/bt_sample_example.tsv)).\n      * **Important:** Data that is common to all units and necessary for genotyping is written to the *bayestyper_cluster_data* directory.\n      * **Note:** Human reference files (canon/decoy) are provided in the BayesTyper data bundle (see [Installation](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper#installation)).\n\n3. Genotype variant clusters: `bayesTyper genotype -v bayestyper_unit_<unit_id>/variant_clusters.bin -c bayestyper_cluster_data -s <samples>.tsv -g <ref_build>_canon.fa -d <ref_build>_decoy.fa -o bayestyper_unit_<unit_id>/bayestyper -z -p <num_threads>`\n      * **Note:** The genotype command also applies the default BayesTyper hard-filters by setting the variant FILTER status and the sample specific allele filter (SAF) format attribute. Please refer to the [filter wiki](https://github.com/bioinformatics-centre/BayesTyper/wiki/Filtering) for information about the filters used, how to changes the defaults up front and how to refilter the data after running the genotyping step.\n      * **Important:** The filtering procedure only filters the genotypes (\"./.\") and hence, downstream tools **should prefilter on the variant quality and FILTER==\\\"PASS\\\"** (e.g. using [*bcftools*](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools)) to obtain the filtered calls.\n\n4. Concatenate units using [*bcftools*](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools): `bcftools concat -O z -o <output_prefix>.vcf.gz bayestyper_unit_1/bayestyper.vcf.gz bayestyper_unit_2/bayestyper.vcf.gz ...`\n    * **Important:** Unit arguments to bcftools should be in ascending order (unit_1 unit_2 ...) for the output to be properly sorted\n"
