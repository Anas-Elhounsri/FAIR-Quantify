It can be used to visualize results of [MITCR](mitcr.milaboratory.com), [MIGEC](https://github.com/mikessh/migec), [MIXCR](mixcr.milaboratory.com) and [MIGMAP](https://github.com/mikessh/migmap) RepSeq processing software as well as popular [IMGT/HighV-QUEST](http://www.imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/login.action) and [ImmunoSEQ Analyzer](http://www.adaptivebiotech.com/immunoseq/analyzer) services. VDJviz can be installed and used as a local server, alternatively you can use an online demo version available at [https://vdjviz.cdr3.net/](https://vdjviz.cdr3.net/) which currently has an upload limit of 25 datasets each having size at most 10,000 clonotypes. The list of VDJviz features at a glance: \n- Clonotype table browsing with V/D/J markup.\n- CDR3 pattern matching for a single sample and across multiple samples with flexible filters.\n- Spectratype, V-Spectratype, V-J usage and clonality analysis. Those can be compared side-by-side using the Compare panel.\n- Summary statistics and rarefaction for multiple samples.\n- Clonotype sharing across samples (many-to-many intersection) with flexible clonotype matching criteria.\n- Uploaded data sharing. \nVDJviz uses [VDJtools API](https://github.com/mikessh/vdjtools) as a back-end. The software utilizes [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/) for running the server instance and state-of-art web graphics libraries such as [D3js](http://d3js.org/) for visualization. \n \n"

To set up the server:\n\n- Run `vdjviz.bat` file (Windows)\n- Run `bash vdjviz -Dconfig.file=application.conf` in your console (Linux/Mac OS)\n\nWait until the server is started, and go to ``localhost:9000`` URL in your browser to open VDJviz.\nThe user generator is enabled in the config by default, so you can login with `vdjviz1@vdjviz.com` as an email and `vdjviz1` as password,\n\nTo stop application just press `Ctrl-C` at any time in console.\n\n> **Troubleshooting**. Note that an exception will be thrown in case the ``9000`` port is busy: ``org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelException: Failed to bind to: /0.0.0.0:9000``. In order to fix it, either close the application that is using this port (in UNIX the \n``lsof -i:9000`` will give the processes that are using the port) or pass the ``-Dhttp.port=XXXX`` (where ``XXXX`` is new port id) argument to ``vdjviz`` shell script (UNIX) / ``vdjviz.bat`` (Windows)\n"
