        "value": "HOME can be run in pairwise mode for two group comparisons and time series mode for more than two group comparisons. It can also be used for mutiple pairwise comparisions with large number of input samples. \n\n**BSSeeker2 CGmap file can be provided as input file directly**\n**or**\n**Input file format as mentioned below needs to provided**\n\nChromosome number, position, strand, type (CG/CHG/CHH) where H is anything but G, methylated reads and total number of reads. For a sample, this information are saved in a single tab separated text file without header, which can be compressed or uncompressed.

This score is then used to cluster the C\u2019s and call the DMRs. The user can set a lower score cutoff if the DMRs seems to be missing or DMR boundaries seems to be missing the differential methylated cytosine near the boundaries. Similarly, the user can increase the cutoff if the boundaries of DMRs seems to be extended. The score ranges from 0-1 and the default is set to 0.1. \n\n*NOTE: the default score is set after rigorous testing on various data sets and need not to be varied in most of the cases. The default should only be changed after proper visualization of the DMRs on the browser.*     \n\n**Parameter \u2013p**\n\nThis parameter controls boundary accuracy of the DMRs. After the DMRs are called they are then pruned based on the scores for the consecutive C\u2019s on both ends. The user can increase the cutoff if the boundaries seems to be extending too far. Similarly the user can lower the cutoff if the DMR boundaries seems to be missing the differential methylated C\u2019s. The range is from 0 to 0.5 and the default is 0.1. Please note that similar to parameter \u2013sc this parameter need not to be altered in most of the cases and should only be changed after proper visual inspection of the DMRs.\n\n **Parameter \u2013ml**\n\nThis parameters sets minimum length (in terms of base pairs) for a DMR to be reported. \nThe DMRs below this length will be skipped and not reported in the filtered DMR output file. The default is 50bp.\n\n**Parameter \u2013ncb**\n\nThis parameter controls when the smaller DMRs should be merged into one. It controls minimum number of C\u2019s required between DMRs to keep them as separate DMRs.  It works in relation with parameter \u2013md (described below). The default is 5 C\u2019s. So, if the number of C\u2019s are less than 5 and the distance is less than 500bp (default for --md) between two consecutive DMRs it will be merged into one single DMR.\n\n**Parameter \u2013md**\n\nThis parameter allows the user to set the merge distance between two consecutive DMRs. The defaults is 500bp. \n\n**Parameter \u2013npp**\n\nThis parameter allows the user to set the number of parallel process to run at a time. The default is 8. \n\n**Parameter \u2013mc**\n\n This parameter allows the user to set minimum number of C\u2019s present in a DMRs to be reported. Any DMR with less than the set value will not be reported in the filtered DMR file. The default is 5.\n\n**Parameter \u2013d**\n\nThis parameter sets minimum average methylation difference present for a DMR to be reported. The DMRs with less than the set value will not be reported in the filtered DMR file. The default is 0.1. \n\n**Parameter \u2013prn**\n\nThis parameter is used in relation to parameter \u2013p (described above). This controls the number of consecutive C\u2019s to be considered from both ends for boundary refinement. The default is 3. Alteration of this parameter should only be done after proper visual inspection of the DMRs. \n\n**Parameter \u2013sin**\n\nThis parameter is used if you want to parallel the code by single chromosome. The default is False, so the code will be parallel for all chromosomes. It should be used with huge chromosomes for example in case of non-CG DMR prediction for mammalian genome. If the genome size is small it is adviced not to use it. To turn it on just say *-sin* in the command line. \n\n**Parameter \u2013ns**\n\nThis parameter is used if you want to use selected number of samples from your sample input file. The default is False, so the code will use all the samples in the sample input file. It allows you to have as many samples as you want in your input file but control the number of samples to use for DMR calling. \n\n**Parameter \u2013sp**\n\nThis parameter is used if you want to select the samples from anywhere in your sample input file. This parameter is used along with **ns** parameter. The default is False, so the code will start from the 1st sample in the sample input file. It allows you to have as many samples as you want in your input file but control the samples to use for DMR calling. \n\n**Parameter \u2013BSSeeker2**\n\nThis parameter is used if you want to provide CGmap file directly. The default is False, so the code will require the files in the input format mentioned above. If the user have methyaltion output files from BSSeeker2, it can be provided directly. To turn it on just say *-BSSeeker2* in the command line. \n\n\n**Parameter \u2013Keepall**\n\nThis parameter is used if you want keep all the positions present in any of the replicates. The default is False, so it will keep only those position that are present in all the replicates of a sample. This parameter is especially useful if the dataset contains more than 1 replicate and contains missing positions which are coverged in atleast one of the replicate. To turn it on just say *-Keepall* in the command line. \n\n**Parameter \u2013wrt**\n\nThis parameter is used if user want to run multiple parawise comparsions with recpect to only specific samples, instead of for all pairwise combinations. For example if user want to compare control (cnt) with all other samples, he/she can use below command:\n```\nHOME-pairwise \t-t [CG/CHG/CHH/CHN/CNN]\t -i [sample_file_fullpath] -wrt cnt\t-o [output_directorypath]\n```\n*NOTE: more than one sample name can also be provided by -wrt, seperated by space*\n\n**Output format**\n\nThe output format is:\n\n```\nchr\tstart\tend\tstatus\tnumC\tmean_meth1\tmean_meth2\tdelta\tAvg_coverage1\tAvg_coverage2\tlen\n```\n\nHere, status refers to state of DMR (hyper/hypo). Mean_meth1 and mean_meth2 refers to mean methylation level for sample1 and 2 respectively. Delta refers to the difference in mean methylation level for two samples. Avg_coverage1 and avg_covereage2 gives the mean coverage for both samples. \n\n\n**DMR detection for more than two groups: time series**\n\n```\nHOME-timeseries \t-t [CG/CHG/CHH/CHN/CNN]\t-i [sample_file_fullpath]\t\t-o [output_directorypath]\n```\nExample: \n\n```\nHOME-timeseries \t-t CG \t-i ./testcase/sample_file_CG.tsv\t\u2013o /outputpath\n```\nRequired arguments:\n\n```\n-t  --type\t            type of DMRs (CG /CHH/CHG/CHN/CNN) \n\n-i --samplefilepath Sample file containing sample names and sample paths for each replicate (TAB sep); each sample info should be in different rows \n\n-o  \u2013-outputpath \t\t    path to the output directory  \n```\n\nOptional arguments: \n\n\n| Parameter                 | Default       | Description   |\t\n| :-------------------------|:-------------:| :-------------|\n| -sc --scorecutoff \t       |\t0.5\t\t\t        | the score from the classifier for each C position \n| -npp -\u2013numprocess \t       |\t5\t            | number of cores to be used\n| -ml --minlength  \t\t       | 50\t           | minimum length of DMRs required to be reported \n| -ns --numsamples          | all           | no.of samples to use for DMR calling; default takes all sample in the file\n| -sp --startposition       | 1st position  | start position of sample in the sample file to use for timeseries DMR calling \n| -BSSeeker2 --BSSeeker2    | False         | input CGmap file from BSSeeker2\n| -mc --minc\t\t\t             | 4 \t           | minimum number of Cs in a DMR\n| -d --delta\t\t\t             | 0.1     \t     | minimum average difference in methylation required in a DMR\n| -sin --singlechrom\t\t\t     | False         | parallel code for single chromosome; *npp* will be used for parallel run for each chr\n| -Keepall --Keepall\t\t      | False     \t   | Keep all cytosine positions present in atleast one of the replicate\n\n**Output format**\n\n```\nchr\tstart\tend\tnumC\tlen\tmax_delta\tconfidence_scores\tComb1-n\n\n```\nHere, Max_delta is the maximum average methylation difference among the compared samples. \nConfidence score takes into account the length, number of C\u2019s and SVM score. The higher value denotes more confident DMR. \nComb1-n denotes the pairwise comparisons for each combination of samples. It reports *start: end: state: delta* for each pairwise comparison. \n \n"
