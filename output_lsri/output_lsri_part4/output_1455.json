If sensitivity argument is used (by including `--sensitivity` when running PHESANT) then analyses additionally adjust for the assessment centre (field [54](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=54)). If `sensitivity` argument is used (by including `--sensitivity` when running PHESANT) and the `genetic` argument is set to `TRUE`, the first 10 genetic principal components (fields [22009_0_1](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=22009) to [22009_0_10](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=22009)) are also included as confounders.

If this option is used then `traitofinterest` argument is not required.\nconfidenceintervals\t| By default `confidenceintervals=TRUE`, but specifying `confidenceintervals=FALSE` means that PHESANT doesn't calculate the association confidence intervals (which may speed up PHESANT).\nstandardise\t\t| By default `standardise=TRUE`, but specifying `standardise=FALSE` means that PHESANT will not standardise the exposure variable. E.g. use this option for binary exposure variables.\ntab\t\t\t| By default phenotype file (phenofile) is comma seperated, but `tab=TRUE` can be specified when your file is tab delimited (e.g. using the `r` option for UK Biobank's `ukbconv` utility).\nmincase\t\t\t| Minimum size of phenotype categories (default is 10).\n\nThe numParts and partIdx arguments are both used to parallelise the phenome scan. E.g. setting numParts to 5 will divide the set of phenotypes into 5 (rough) parts and then partIdx can be used to call the phenome scan on a specific part (1-5).\n"

For example, data code [100001](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/coding.cgi?id=100001) has values half, 1 and 2+ coded as 555, 1 and 200, respectively. We need the 'half' value to be less than the '1' value, so we change the order to '555|1|200'. NB: if this column is used then and any value is not included then this value is set to NA (i.e. this field can be used to remove and reorder values at the same time).\n4. reassignments - Any value changes that are needed. For example, in data code [100662](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/coding.cgi?id=100662), the values\n7 and 6 may be deemed equal (both representing 'never visited by friends/family' so we can set '7=6' to assign the value 6 to all participants with the value 7.\n5. default_value - A default value assigned to all participants with no value for the field, but with a value for field stated in `default_value_related_field` column below. This is used where a category is not explicitly stated in the field but \ninstead needs to be determined by looking at whether another field has a value. Typically, this occurs where there is no category for 'none' in a questionnaire field, because participants were told they did not have to mark 'none' but could instead leave it blank \n(see for example section 5.3 in the [24 hour diet questionnaire manual](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=118240)). Hence, we assume that if they completed the questionnaire and have not ticked a value, then the value is 'none'. See default value example below.\n6. default_value_related_field - The field used to determine which participants are assigned the default value. All participants with a value in the field stated here, and with no value for a field with this data code, are assigned the default value stated in `default_value`.\n"

ValueType column - the field type, either 'Integer', 'Continuous', 'Categorical single', 'Categorical multiple', or a few others we do not use.\n2. Three Cat_ID and three Cat_Title columns - the three levels of the category hierarchy, that can be seen [here](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/label.cgi).\n3. FieldID column - We use this to match the variable in our biobank data file to the correct row in this TSV file.\n4. Field column -  The name of the field.\n\nThe variable information file also has the following columns that we have added, to provide additional information used in the phenome scan:\n\n1. TRAIT_OF_INTEREST - Specifies any field that represents the trait of interest (set this column to 'YES'). This is a marker so that after the phenome scan is run we can use these\nresults as validation only (e.g. a pheWAS of the BMI FTO SNP would expect the BMI phenotypes to show high in the results ranking), i.e. they do not contribute to the multiple testing burden. We have set this up for BMI, so have marked BMI/weight fields as the trait of interest - you will need to change this for your particular trait of interest. \nFor categorical multiple fields you may want to mark the whole field as denoting the trait of interest (e.g all [cancers](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=20001)), or just a specific value (e.g. a particular type of cancer). To do the former set this column to YES, and to do the latter specify each particular value in this field separated by a bar, i.e. 'VALUE1|VALUE2'.\n2. EXCLUDED - Phenotypes we apriori decide to exclude from the phenome scan. Any field with a value in this field is excluded, and we state a code that describes the reason we exclude a variable (for future reference). Our codes and reasons are as follows (of course for your phenome scan you can add others as you would like): \n - YES-ACE: \"Assessment center environment\" variables that do not directly describe the participant.\n - YES-AGE: Age variables.\n - YES-ASSESSMENT-CENTRE: The assessment centre the participant attended.\n - YES-BIOBANK-SUGGESTED-VARIABLE: Variables not initially included in our data request, but that biobank suggested we receive.\n - YES-CAT-SIN-MUL-VAL: Fields that were 'Categorical single' types but had multiple values (several arrays in an instance). We do not deal with these currently so remove from the phenome scan.\n - YES-GENETIC: Genetic description variables.\n - YES-SENSITIVE: Variables not received from Biobank because they are sensitive so have more restricted access.\n - YES-SEX: Sex fields.\n - YES-POLYMORPHIC: Fields denoted as [polymorphic](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/help.cgi?cd=polymorphic) by UK Biobank (e.g. [field 87](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=87)). \n - YES-PROCESSING: Fields that describe some aspect of the data collection process rather than some aspect (phenotype) of the participants themselves (e.g. [field 23049](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=23049)).\n - YES-SUPERSEDED: Fields that have been superseded by another version. For example, all fields used to create the aggregated ['first occurence' disease variables](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=1712).\n - YES-DATE: Fields that are dates. Dates are not currently included in phenome scans. They are only used where they are converted to a binary variable (see DATE_CONVERT column below).\n3. CAT_MULT_INDICATOR_FIELDS - every categorical multiple field must have a value in this column. \nThe value describes which set of participants to include as the negative examples, when a binary variable is created from each value (see above cited paper for more information). \nThe positive examples for a value `v` in this categorical multiple field are simply the people with this particular value. However the negative values can be determined in three ways:\n - ALL - Include all participants (any participant without value `v` is assigned `FALSE`, except those with a value denoting missingness (i.e. value is <0)). \n - NO_NAN - Included only those who have at least one value for this field (assign `FALSE` to any participant with at least one value for this field, where these values do not include value `v`, and also do not include a value denoting missingness (i.e. value is <0).\n - fieldID - Include only those who have a value for another field, with ID `fieldID` (assign `FALSE` to any participant without value `v` and without a value denoting missingness (i.e. value is <0) and with a value in this other field with ID `fieldID`).\n4. CAT_SINGLE_TO_CAT_MULT - Specifies fields that have the categorical single field type (as specified by UK Biobank) but that we actually want to treat as categorical multiple. State YES in this column to change this. To also convert the instances to arrays, state YES-INSTANCES. For example, field [20107](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=20107) has illnesses stored in 10 arrays (for each instance) so it makes sense to treat this as a categorical(multiple) field. Field [40011](http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=40011) stores the histology of cancer tumours but is stored in 31 instances (rather than arrays) so we specify YES-INSTANCES so this field is treated as a categorical (multiple) field and the instances are treated as arrays.\n5. DATE_CONVERT - Specifies that a date field should be included and converted to a binary variable indicating whether each participant has a date in this field or not. This is used for the ['first occurence' disease variables](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/label.cgi?id=1712) that are date fields.\n5. DATA_CODING - The data coding IDs used to map a field to its data code in the data code information file described above. This is required for categorical (single) fields.\n"
