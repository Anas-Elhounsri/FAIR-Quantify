The folder src contains all the source code, and the folder bin contains the compiled binary executable. Under the folder bin, two small matrices, SM10 and M3_4 for testing purpose are also provided. M3_4 is a 3 x 4 matrix and SM10 is a 10 x 10 symmetric matrix. The suffix _Single, _Double and _Text indicate the format of single precision, double precision, and text file, respectively.\nThe program is written in the C language, and it uses Intel Math Kernel Library. So, in order to compile the source code, one needs to install C compiler, e.g., the Intel C/C++ Compilers, the GNU C Compiler or Visual Studio C Compiler. Additionally, one needs to install Intel MKL.\nWhen C compiler and MKL are available in the system, one can enter the src folder and modify the makefile based on the C compiler and the MKL paths; then type make or nmake to compile. After that, the ocma executable will be generated in the bin folder. \n\nCompiling options\nWe have provided two options for compiling the executable. \n```\n> make (or nmake) static\n```\nwill generate an executable that doesn\u2019t rely on the Intel MKL libraries. However, it still relies on libiomp5.so (Linux) or libiomp5md.dll (Windows) for multi-threading OpenMP settings. We have provided a version for Windows 7 and a version for CentOS 7.3 in the release.  \n```\n> make (or nmake) dynamic \n```\nwill generate a smaller executable that doesn\u2019t contain the Intel MKL libraries. As such, the executable will be dynamically linked to the libraries during the course. \n"
