In most genomic studies of tumors, genetic variation is detected through pairwise comparisons of the tumor and a matched normal tissue from the sample donor. In many cases, only somatic variants are reported, which hinders the use of existing tools that detect sample swaps solely based on genotypes of inherited variants. To address this problem, we have developed Somalier, a tool that operates directly on alignments and does not require jointly called germline variants. Instead, Somalier extracts a small sketch of informative genetic variation for each sample. Sketches from hundreds of germline or somatic samples can then be compared in under a second, making Somalier a useful tool for measuring relatedness in large cohorts. Somalier produces both text output and an interactive visual report that facilitates the detection and correction of sample swaps using multiple relatedness metrics.\"\nauthors:\n    - \n      family-names: Pedersen\n      given-names: Brent S.\n      email: bpederse@gmail.com\ntitle: \"Somalier: rapid relatedness estimation for cancer and germline studies using efficient genome sketches\"\npreferred-citation:\n    authors:\n      - \n        family-names: Pedersen\n        given-names: Brent S.\n        email: bpederse@gmail.com\n      - \n        family-names: Bhetariya\n        given-names: Preetida J.\n      - \n        family-names: Brown\n        given-names: Joe M.\n      - \n        family-names: Kravitz\n        given-names: Stephanie N.\n      - \n        family-names: Marth\n        given-names: Gabor\n      - \n        family-names: Jensen\n        given-names: Randy L.\n      - \n        family-names: Bronner\n        given-names: Mary P.\n      - \n        family-names: Underhill\n        given-names: Hunder R.\n      - \n        family-names: Quinlan\n        given-names: Aaron R.\n    title: \"Somalier: rapid relatedness estimation for cancer and germline studies using efficient genome sketches\"\n    journal: Genome Medicine\n    issue: 12\n    number: 62\n    type: article\n    year: 2020\n    doi: 10.1186/s13073-020-00761-2\n\nversion: 0.2.14\ndate-released: 2022-01-01\nlicense: MIT\n"

        "value": "`somalier` takes a list of known polymorphic sites. Even a few hundred (or dozen) sites\ncan be a very good indicator of relatedness. The best sites are those with a population\nallele frequency close to 0.5 as that maximizes the probability that any 2 samples will differ.\nA list of such sites is provided in the [releases](https://github.com/brentp/somalier/releases)\nfor GRCh37 and hg38. \nIn order to quickly calculate genotypes at these sites, `somalier` assays the exact base.\nThe extraction step is done directly from the bam/cram files 1 sample at a time. \nThe `relate` step is run on the output of the `extract` commands. It runs extremely quickly\nso that new samples can be added and compared. It uses 3 bit-vectors per sample for hom-ref,\nhet, hom-alt. Each bitvector is a sequence of 64 bit integers where each bit is set if\nthe variant at that index in the sample is for example, heterozygous. With this setup,\nwe can use fast bitwise operations and [popcount](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/population_count)\nhardware instructions to calculate relatedness extremely quickly. \nFor each sample-pair, it reports:\n1. IBS0 -- the number of sites where one sample is hom-ref and another is hom-alt\n2. IBS2 -- the number of sites where the samples have the same genotype\n3. shared-hets -- the number of sites where both samples are heterozygotes\n4. shared-hom-alts -- the number of sites where both samples are homozygous alternate \nThese are used to calculate [relatedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship)\nand a measure of relatedness that is unaffected by loss-of-heterozygosity that is often seen in some \ncancers. The interactive output allows toggling between any of these measures. \nIt also reports depth information and the count of `HET`, `HOM_REF`, `HOM_ALT`, and `unknown` genotypes for each sample\nalong with a number of metrics that are useful for general QC.\n \n"

This speeds up the relatedness step by about 100X such that we can calculate relatedness of all 4,825,171 possible pairwise combinations of the 2,504 thousand genomes samples in about 20 seconds.\r\nIt also fixes a bug in the a-allele/b-allele designation for VCF that caused problems when comparing samples extracted from VCF/BCF to those from CRAM/BAM. \r\n\r\nThe readme now includes instructions on how to estimate ancestry from somalier sketches.\r\n\r\nv0.2.3\r\n======\r\n+ calculate relatedness correctly for samples with parent-ids specified\r\n  when the parents are not actually in the pedigree file.\r\n+ use bit-vectors to calculate relatedness. this gives up to a 250X speedup.\r\n  with this code, I can now evaluate relatedness for 3756 in under 30 seconds on my laptop.\r\n+ better scaling of X and Y depth\r\n+ use final RG as the sample id in relate\r\n+ output expected relatedness in .pairs.tsv file\r\n+ fix ref/alt (a/b-allele ordering for VCF) this was a bug that caused problems when comparing\r\n  samples extracted from VCF files to other samples extracted from BAM/CRAM files.

        "description": "v0.2.0\r\n======\r\nThis was a large re-write of `somalier`. The command-line usage is backwards incompatible (but\r\nshould not change moving forward). There is now a per-sample extract step:\r\n```\r\nsomalier extract -d extracted/ -s $sites_vcf -f $fasta $sample.cram\r\n```\r\n\r\nfollowed by a relate step:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsomalier relate --ped $ped extracted/*.somalier\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enables parallelization by sample across nodes and the resulting, extracted, binary \"somalier\"\r\nfiles are only ~220KB per sample so reading them is nearly instant and the `relate` step\r\nruns in **10 seconds for my 603-sample test-case** which makes adjusting pedigree files or removing samples\r\nand re-running a much faster process.\r\nThis means we can add a single (n+1) sample and once it's `extract`ed, we can compare it to an entire cohort in a few seconds.\r\n\r\nsomalier extract can also take a (multi-sample) VCF and create an idential \"somalier\" file\r\nfor cases when a VCF is available. \r\n\r\nThe sites files (linked below) are also greatly improved (with fewer sites, better accuracy) in this release)\r\nFor example, here is the output from **previous version**:\r\n![somalier-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1739/58638145-4e8a0080-82b1-11e9-9df2-49a15466f70d.png)\r\ncompared to this version:\r\n![somalier-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1739/58638163-5ba6ef80-82b1-11e9-9abe-94bea9dd1ac6.png)\r\n\r\nNote how on the bottom figure for this version, like colors (relationships indicated from a pedigree file) cluster more tightly than in the previous version.\r\n\r\nThis release also reports values for X and Y chromosomes which help to evaluate observed vs expected sex, which can help resolve sample swaps.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\nThis release comes with 2 linux binaries:\r\n+ [somalier_static](https://github.com/brentp/somalier/releases/download/v0.1.5/somalier_static) is a completely static binary and the recommended way to run somalier; just wget, chmod+x (get a sites file) and go.\r\n+ [somalier_shared](https://github.com/brentp/somalier/releases/download/v0.1.5/somalier_shared) requires htslib (and libhts.so). use this binary if you need to access S3 or https files.\r\n\r\n# sites files\r\n\r\n[sites.hg38.vcf.gz](https://github.com/brentp/somalier/files/3234292/sites.hg38.vcf.gz)\r\n[sites.GRCh37.vcf.gz](https://github.com/brentp/somalier/files/3234293/sites.GRCh37.vcf.gz)\r\n\r\n",

        "value": "`somalier` makes checking any number of samples for identity easy **directly from the alignments** or from jointly-called VCFs:\n\nThe first step is to extract sites. For **VCF** just use:\n```\nsomalier extract -d extracted/ --sites sites.vcf.gz -f /data/human/g1k_v37_decoy.fa $cohort.vcf.gz\n```\n\nwith a sites file from [releases](https://github.com/brentp/somalier/releases/latest)\n\nFor **BAM** or **CRAM**, use:\nThis is parallelizable by sample via cluster or cloud, but here, using a for loop:\n```\nfor f in *.cram; do\n    somalier extract -d extracted/ --sites sites.vcf.gz -f /data/human/g1k_v37_decoy.fa $f\ndone\n```\n\n`--sites` is a VCF of known polymorphic sites in VCF format. A good set is provided in\nthe [releases](https://github.com/brentp/somalier/releases) but any set of common variants will work.\n\n\n> :warning: `somalier` can work on GVCF and individual VCFs, but it is\n> recommended to extract from bam/cram when possible. It is also good to\n> extract from a jointly-called VCF/BCF when only looking within that cohort.\n> While extracting from a single-sample VCF is possible (with --unknown) and\n> GVCF is also supported, these options are less accurate and more prone to\n> problems.\n\n\nThe next step is to calculate relatedness on the extracted data:\n\n```\nsomalier relate --ped $pedigree extracted/*.somalier\n```\nThis will create text and interactive HTML output\nthat makes it fast and easy to detect mismatched samples and sample-swaps.\nThe files created are:\n+ `{output_prefix}.samples.tsv # creates a .ped like file with extra QC columns\n+ `{output_prefix}.pairs.tsv # shows IBS for all possible sample pairs\n+ `{output_prefix}.groups.tsv # shows pairs of samples above a certain relatedness\n+ `{output_prefix}.html # interactive html\n\nExample html output is [here](https://brentp.github.io/somalier/ex.html)\n\nNote that the `somalier relate` command runs extremely quickly (< 2 seconds for 600 samples and ~1 minute for 4,500 samples) so it's possible\nto add/remove samples or adjust a pedigree file and re-run iteratively.\n\nFor example to add the **n + 1th** samples, just run `somalier extract` on the new sample and then re-use\nthe already extracted data from the `n` original samples.\n\nFor *huge* sample-sets, if you run into a bash error for *argument list too long*, you can pass the somalier files as quoted\nglob strings like:  `\"/path/to/set-a/*.somalier\" \"/path/to/set-b/*.somalier\"`.\n"

This will be much faster, in cases where it's available,\nthis would look like:\n\n```\nsomalier extract -d extracted/ --sites sites.vcf.gz -f /data/human/g1k_v37_decoy.fa joint.vcf.gz\n```\n\nfollowing this, there will be a `$sample.somalier` file for each sample in the `joint.vcf.gz`\n\nNote that `somalier` uses the `AD` field to extract depth information. If that FORMAT field is not present in the\nheader, then it will use the genotypes only and use a total depth of 20 (10,10 for heterozygote), etc.\n\n\nThen run:\n```\nsomalier relate --ped $pedigree_file cohort/*.somalier\n```\nThis will create an html file for QC in a few seconds. \n\nNote that if a new sample is added to the cohort, it's only necessary to perform\nthe `extract` step on that sample and then run the (fast) `relate` step again with all\nof the extracted files.\n"
