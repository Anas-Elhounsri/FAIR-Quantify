All subsequent pipeline components use `read_table.csv` for analysis and do not depend on `raw_read_table.csv`.\n5. `loci.csv` A file containing a data.frame with columns locus, pos.  The locus column gives the number of the locus, starting with 1 and incrementing by one.   The pos column gives the subset of the variable positions contained in each locus.  \n6. `h.csv` Each row corresponds to a potential haplotype.   Each column has the position as a header.  Columns exactly correspond to variable positions.  \n7. `y.csv, P.csv` The y vector and P matrix in the least squares \\|y - Ph\\|^2.\n8. `solutions.csv` - A file containing all solutions generated for the penalized regression.   Each column represents a single solution to the penalized regression.   \n9. `final_haplo.csv` - A csv file containing nucleotide values of reconstructed haplotypes, but only at the variable positions.  \n10. `final_haplo.fasta` - A fasta file containing the reconstructed haplotypes over the whole reference.  \n \n"

        "value": "* Relevant files: `raw_read_table.csv`, `read_table.csv` \n* Relevant function:`variant_calls_to_read_table.pipeline`:\n\nVariant calling cannot address errors that transform true variable nucleotides into other true variable nucleotides.  For example, suppose at position 100, there are true variants A and G, while at position 101 there are also true variants A and G.  Further, suppose that those variants occur only in the pairs AA (for positions 100,101) and GG.   Then there will be some errors that convert, say, the A at position 100 to a G.  These errors will not be caught be variant calling, but will create false GA reads.  The problem is particularly serious given the high coverage and relatively long read length (i.e. 200 base pair) in typical NGS dataset.  Failure to account for such errors often leads to an enourmous number of potential haplotypes and, consequently, poor RegressHaplo performance.\n\nThe file `raw_read_table.csv` contains all reads in the dataset.  A read error correction step is then performed, and reads that pass the error correction step are contained in `read_table.csv`.  Reads in `raw_read_table.csv` that do not pass the error correction step are thrown out.   The `sig` parameter to the function `variant_calls_to_read_table.pipeline` can be used to modulate the number of reads that are thrown out by the error correction (i.e. lowering `sig` leads to more reads being thrown out).   Choosing the right `sig` values amounts to a balance between overfitting and underfitting.  If too many reads are thrown out, RegressHaplo will run quickly but not be able to reconstruct the true haploytpes (underfitting).  If too few reads are thrown out, RegressHaplo will run slowly and likely reconstruct false haplotypes (overfitting).\n\nThe most time intensive step of `variant_calls_to_read_table.pipeline` is typically construction of `raw_read_table.csv`.  Once `raw_read_table.csv` is constructed, users can set the `use_raw_read_table=T` to use the existing `raw_read_table.csv` and just create a `read_table.csv` file through error correction.   This can be useful when interatively attempting to find the right `sig` value for read error correction.\n"

All positions in variant\\_calls.csv are taken as variable by RegressHaplo and used for the analysis.  Including non-variable positions will lead to slower run times with no accuracy benefit.  If variability along the reference is very high, RegressHaplo performance may be poor because there are too many potential haplotypes.\n\nWith this in mind, sometimes, even if a position is variable, it is useful to remove it from consideration; for example, when the user is not interested in particular regions of the reference or when including all variable positions leads to poor results. To prevent RegressHaplo from considering a given position as variable, remove the corresponding row from the `variant_calls.csv` file.   Alternatively, the `sig` parameter to `bam_to_variant_calls.pipeline` can be set lower, leading to less variant calls, i.e. less rows in `variant_calls.csv`.\n"

On each locus, RegressHaplo attempts to construct all possible haplotypes reflecting the reads that cover the locus.  At first, RegressHaplo builds loci by selecting regions of the reference that have no linkage information across them.  Once this split is made, there are often too many haplotypes for RegressHaplo to consider in reasonable time, so loci are further split.   The parameter `max_num_haplotype` sets the maximum number of haplotypes RegressHaplo allows; reasonable run times on the order of several hours are acheived for `max_num_haplotype` in the 500-1200 range.  Higher values are not recommended and run times are uncertain.\n\nThe file `loci.csv` specifies the loci.  The file has two columns:  locus and pos.  The locus column just labels the locus number, i.e. 1-n where n is the total number of loci.  The pos column specifies the variable postions that are considered part of a single locus.  For example, an entry such as '1+10+23+40' represents a locus covering variable postions 1,10,23, and 40.  \n\nUsers can manually modify the `loci.csv` file to create specific loci of interest.  The positions included must exactly match the positions included in the `read_table.csv` file, with each position included in exactly one locus.  Note: Some positions in `variant_calls.csv` may not be included in `read_table.csv` because none of the reads covering those positions passed the read error correction step.  \n"

If the number of global haplotypes exceeds the value of `max_num_haplotypes` passed to `loci_to_haplotypes.pipeline`, then RegressHaplo does local regressions on each locus and selects a subset of the locus halpotypes.  This process is repeated until the number of global haplotypes is less than `max_num_haplotypes`.\n\nGenerally, constructing loci and choosing haplotype subsets is complex and the choices RegressHaplo makes may not be optimal, or the choices may not reflect user goals.  **Users can essentially skip the entire pipeline up to and including `loci_to_haplotypes.pipeline` by specifying their own haplotypes through the `h.csv` file**.  The columns of `h.csv` are the position numbers of the variable positions (i.e. postions in `variant_calls.csv`).  Each row gives the nucleotide and indel pattern of a global haplotype across the variable positions.\n\nAs an example application, users can use another haplotype reconstruction tool to construct haplotypes on two disjoint pieces of the reference, say locus 1 and locus 2.   The constructed haplotypes can be used to produce global haplotypes by pasting together all possible combinations of haplotypes on locus 1 and 2.   RegressHaplo can then be used to select the best global haplotypes, thereby inferring the linkage information that another tool is not able to infer.\n\n\n"
