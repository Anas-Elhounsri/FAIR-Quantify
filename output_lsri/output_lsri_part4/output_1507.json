Increasing the number of iterations may improve the ordering results, but will result in a longer run time. \n- Use log data for input into WaveCrest?: If Yes, data will be logged for the cell reordering. This may alleviate effects due to outliers and produce cleaner results. \n- What type of trend do you expect?: If we assume the target temporal pattern of each marker is monotone increasing (decreasing) from the first cell to the last cell, **Linear** should be used. If the target temporal pattern is expected to follow a quadratic / cubic / quartic polynomial,  **Quadratic / Cubic / Quartic** should be selected. An example quartic form may be bi-modal expression over time. It is important to consider what trend of expression is expected. This will be used to recover the cell order as well as in identifying additional genes. \n- Number of additional genes to plot: Number of additional dynamic genes to plot when the previous option is \"Yes\". If it is not specified, the top 10 genes will be included in the output plots. \n- Reverse the recovered cell order: The starting point for WaveCrest is random. Instead of rerunning with another seed, if Yes, this option will just reverse the recovered order. Just make sure to reuse the original seed number! \n- Plot heatmap of marker genes following the recovered cell order?: If Yes, then a heatmap will be generate containing the genes from the Marker list with columns ordered according to the recovered cell order.\n- Colors for heatmap: If the box is checked then the default geen red colors will be used, otherwise uncheck this box and select 3 new colors to represent low, middle, and high expression in the heatmap. \n"
