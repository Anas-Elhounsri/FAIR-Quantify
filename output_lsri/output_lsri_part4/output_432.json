You would be warned that these plugins are outdated. You need to put the dll in a specific  folder within the Qt (e.g. C:\\Qt\\qtcreator4.5.0\\bin\\plugins\\designer QVTKWidgetPlugin.dll). Hope you would have no problem with    OpenGl2 problem otherwise you may need to compile for OpenGl next time because some legacy plugins are written for OpenGl and do not support OpenGl.\n \n ### 3. Compile and install DCMTK.\n    \n    This is the DICOM toolkit. There are versions that are not free. For iBEX, the free version is enough. But if you think about a commercial product you MAY require to pay and buy the complete package.\n    \n ### 4. Compile and install CTK.\n    \n  This is the trickiest section. By now you should have Qt, VTK and DCMTK installed on your computer and the paths are \n  added to environment variables (e.g. C:\\Qt\\5.9.4\\msvc2015_64\\bin and C:\\Qt\\5.9.4\\msvc2015_64\\bin). The CTK make file requires\n  Qt and VTK for compile.

Compile and build iBEX\n    \n   Now you can build the iBEX and run it! Sample screenshots are shown in the following\n   \n   *Main screen*\n   \n   <img src=\"https://github.com/altaybrusan/ibex/blob/FastDev/docs/screen%20shots/main_dialog.JPG\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\">\n\n   \n   *Patient registration dialog*\n   \n   <img src=\"https://github.com/altaybrusan/ibex/blob/FastDev/docs/screen%20shots/registration_dialog.JPG\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\">\n   \n       \n   *Examination dialog*\n   \n   <img src=\"https://github.com/altaybrusan/ibex/blob/FastDev/docs/screen%20shots/exposure_dialog.jpg\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\">\n   \n  # Extend via plugins\n  \n  The other way to extend iBEX functionalities is through adding external plugins. Way we are planned to keep iBEX dynamic alive.  For developers how has no time to make iBEX from scratch, a set of pre-built projects are going to be prepared and they can write their own plugins and extend the iBEX functionalities based on the needs, instead of rebuilding everything from scratch.\n  \n  iBEX kernel supports two types of extension plugins. First type is for adding a device driver. An X-ray machine is actually  is an assembly of a couple of components (devices) such as digital detector, generator, collimator, etc. Usually, these components come with device drivers. In order to make the communication in between iBEX and these devices feasible, developers are required to develop a wrapper and then put them within plugin directory. iBEX automatically loads the plugins and then integrate them during the program start time. The engine that were used for plugin extension is based on Qt. Consequently, specific rules and regulations should be followed to make the connection successful. \n  \n  <img src=\"https://github.com/altaybrusan/ibex/blob/FastDev/docs/images/plugin_mechanism.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"350\">\n   \n  iBEX provide IDevice interface to make the communication with devices standard! Developers are required to implement\n  this interface for their device-driver wrappers. IDEvice plugin interface provide the following list of services:\n    \n    - Read/Write to device\n    - Execute a command\n    - Update a setting and a parameter\n    - Provide a graphical container (Widget) to display the user interface of the plugin (if any available)\n    - Notify the plugin with an error, message or dialog show up.\n   \n       \n   ## Example \n   \n   Teledyne detector is a digital X-ray detector. The following snippet shows how the IDevice is implemented for this device (due to legal issues we cannot show the detector's API here, but one can take a glance over the source code to understand the mechanism better).\n   \n   <img src=\"https://github.com/altaybrusan/ibex/blob/FastDev/docs/screen%20shots/plugin_snippet.PNG\" width=\"550\" height=\"350\">\n  \n  The other type of extension is algorithm. These extension plugins are required to implement IAlgorithm interface. This type of plugins is useful for adding new \n  image processing algorithms into the iBEX core.\n  \n  <img src=\"https://github.com/altaybrusan/ibex/blob/FastDev/docs/screen%20shots/IAlgorithm_implementation.PNG\" width=\"550\" height=\"350\">\n  \n  Like IDevice interface, IAlgorithm interface also provide a set of standard mechanisms such as widget container, signaling and communication and command execution. The ButterworthLowPassFilter.cpp could be visited as a template for developing new algorithms. We must emphasize that in order to make the communication between plugins and kernel most efficient, all the data are carried over standard containers defined within vtk (such as vtkImageData)\n  \n  \n  \n     \n\n\n"
