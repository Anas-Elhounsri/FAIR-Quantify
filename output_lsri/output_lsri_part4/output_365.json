See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License \nThis work was supported in part by Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell Cancer Research Fund Fellowship DRG 972, the US National Institutes of Health R01-GM120604 and the kind support of the RCSB Protein Data Bank.\nDS Goodsell & AJ Olson (1992) \"Molecular Illustration in Black and White\" JMolGraphics 10, 235-240.\nApril 2019 Simplified and released with only non-photorealistic rendering \nCommand file is read from unit 5 (standard in), and a bunch of diagnostic stuff is written to unit 6 (standard out) \nThe command file has command cards (read, center, world, calculate, etc), followed by parameter cards needed for each command. Please issue command cards in this order:\n1. `read` \u2014 reads coordinates and selection/rendering parameters\n2. `center, translate, xrot, yrot, zrot, scale` commands, in any order\n3. `world` \u2014 defines rendering parameter\n4. `illustrate` \u2014 defines illustration parameters\n5. `calculate` \u2014 renders the image and writes ppm file \nThis program has many idiosyncracies and almost no error checking (beware\u2026postdoc code from the 90s!) \nSelection/rendering cards in the \u201cread\u201d command are read sequentially until one without \u201cATOM\u201d or \u201cHETATM\u201d is found. Atoms are compared to cards in order, and if a match is found, the atom is assigned those parameters. This process provides a lot of flexibility with very few cards, if you\u2019re clever about the order of cards and the use of wildcards. Any number of rotation cards may be added, and they are concatenated when added. This means they are effectively applied last to first, so if you\u2019re progressively refining an orientation, add new rotations to the top of the list. Rotations are applied first, then centering, and finally translation. This ensures that the molecule is always centered in the view. Use the translation if you want it offset. Origin at upper left, +x down, +y left to right, +z towards viewer, molecules clipped at z=0 \nOutlines are created by calculating the local derivative of the z-value using a variety of kernels, then providing a range of values of these derivatives that will be given shades of gray and black. Outlines may be drawn based on the contours and outer shape of the molecule, between subunits, and based on the differences in the residue number in chains. \n         atom descriptor (A10) matched with columns 13-22 of PDB file, \u201c-\u201d is a wildcard \n    translation vector x,y,z (3 real) translation in Angstroms \nBackground and fog parameters \n    rback r,g,b (3 real) color of background (0.0-1.0) \n    rfog r,g,b (3 real) color of fog (0.0-1.0) \n    pfogh, pfogl (2 real) fractional transparency of fog at front and back of molecule \n    coneangle (real) angle of shadowing around each atom \n    l_low, l_high (2 real) thresholds for gray to black \n    ikernel (integer) kernel for derivative calculation (1,2,3,4 smoothest=4) \n    l_diff_min, l_diff_max (2 integer) range of z-difference used for derivative (Angstroms) \n                    0.0,5.0 is typical \n"
