To speed up computation, this actor groups spectra into batches of 100 concurrent spectra (tunable by advanced parameter `hillBatchSize`), and build hills for each batch in parallell and soon as the batch is complete and there is available concurrency. \nBatch hill building is performed by `RawHillActor`s. Here each new spectrum is added to the current set of hills via the `RawHillActor.processSpec()` and `RawHillActor.merge()` methods. The active hills are sorted by m/z and so is the centroid spectrum. The method iterates over both these lists simultaneously and compares the m/z difference of neighbouring hills and centroid peaks to a ppm threshold (advanced param `hillPPM`). If the m/z different is below the threshold the pair is added to a temporar buffer set. If the current m/z difference is outside the threshold, the current buffer is processed by iteratively removing the pair with the smallest m/z difference until no pairs are below the hillPPM threshold. For pairs that are remove, the centroid peak is appended to the respective hill profile. Centroid peaks that do not match to any hill are appended as new hills.  \nWhen hills are build for all spectrum batches, the resultant completed hill lists are sewn together so as to not split hills that happen to elute over spectrum batch borders. This process in highly similar to the `RawHillActor.merge()` method, but located in the `HillBuilderActorParallel.merge()`.  \nFor each hill in the sewn hill list, a smoothed intensity profile is calculated by a 3-point sliding median filter, followed by a 3-point sliding mean filter (adv. `hillSmoothMedianWindow` and `hillSmoothMeanWindow`). Following this, hills are recursive split in two in the rt dimension is a local minimum can be detected such that the smaller of the maximum value before the minimum and after the minimum is at least 30% more intense than the minimum (adv. `hillValleyFactor`).  \nAfter hill splitting, hills of length 2 or 1 are discarded (adv. `hillMinLength`). For remaining hills, the total intensity is computed as the sum of the raw intensities, and the average m/z and m/z error are computed by bootstrap sampling 150 times (adv. `hillNBoots`) from the centroid peaks of the hill and computing weighted average m/z values. The average m/z and m/z error are computed from these bootstraps.  \nFinally, to remove hills relating to ambient molecules, hill longer than 40 spectra (adv. `hillPeakFactorMinLength`) and with the first and last centroid peak larger than 50% of the hill apex are removed (adv. `hillPeakFactor`).\n \n"

A new datastructure in created with one list per hill, containing indices to other hills that it can be directly linked to. To collect the clusters, this structure is traversed while removing indices and adding them to a set. When all indices in the current set have been traversed the set cluster is complete. The cluster is finally represented by the set of detected edges between hills. \nTwo hills are joined by an edge if their m/z difference is close enough to the average isotope pattern mass difference divided by the considered charge (see `Deisotoper.fitsDiff()`), and if their intesity profiles have a cosine correlation >= 0.6 (adv. `deisoCorr`). Whether the m/z difference in close enought to the expected value is determined by the bootstrap-computed m/z errors of the hills and the error of having one sulphur isotope (S34) instead of two C13 isotopes.\n \n"

The best current pattern is detected by seeding from the 100 most intense hills and each considered charge state. For each seed and charge state, hills are sought for at +- isotope pattern diff / z (`Cluster.extendSeed()`). If such hills are detected with a intesity profile cosine correlation >= 0.6 (adv. `deisoCorr`), the process is repeated adding another isotope pattern difference, until to matching hill is found. The detected primary isotope pattern is checked for local minima ( applying the `deisoValleyFactor` threshold ), which are truncated around the seed. For hills with masses < 1000, all extending hills that are of lower mass are removed.  \nThe final quality control of isotope patterns is the comparison vs. the isotope pattern of a averagine peptide of the same mass. The current isotope pattern is represented by a list of one intensity per hill. This list is compared to the intensities of the averagine isotopes down to 1e-6 prevalence by shifting the averagine isotopes and computing cosine correlations and percent explained averagine prevalence (`DinoUtil.optimalAlignOverlap()`). The explained prevalence and correlation are multiplied together and averagine shift with the highest value selected to determine the true monoisotopic peak. Finally the pattern is rejected if the averarine correlation is < 0.6 (adv. `averagineCorr`) or the explained prevalence < 0.5 (averagineExplained).  \n"
