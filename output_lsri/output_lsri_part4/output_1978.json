        "value": "---------------------------\n\nC-HMM is a software to detect remote/distant homologues from protein sequence databases. It is based on HMMs(Hidden Markov Models) for identifying the deep evolutionary relationships of protein sequences. The aim of developing C-HMM is to provide a platform for identifying distant protein relationships in less computational time against any user defined protein sequence database. C-HMM is divided into three modules:\n\n1. **Cascade-HMM**: This is main module of C-HMM which allows sequence searches for many generations. Each generation consists of multiple Jackhmmer searches against a database. \n\n2. **Custom-HMM**: In this module, filtered hits (first generation) obtained by Cascade-HMM are clustered and clustered hits are used to generate HMM profiles. These HMM profiles are further used for initiating next generations. \n\n3. **Cluster-HMM**: This module allows clustering of the hits obtained by Cascade-HMM after every generation. This helps in reducing the search timings. It can be combined with Cascade-HMM.\n"

This helps in backtracing and identifying the intermediate sequences in each generation.\n3. commulative_result_seq_name.out: This file stores the commulative unique hits from each generation. \nIf user has opted for clustering of hits, each generation directory would also have gen_#_result_nr.out.clstr file.

It's default value is 10-3 (refer BLAST manual for more details). \n3. cascade.subjectFilters: In this row user has to define h-value and length filter criterion. h-value is a inclusion threshold for the profile generation. hits below the h-value are not considered for profile generation. It's default value is 10-3.\nLength filter defines the alignment length between the query and hit sequence. Each hit sequence length should be higher than the threshold. It's default value is 75%. \n3. cascade.perGenerationIteration: This parameter describes the number of iterations of Jackhmmer to be performed in each generation. It's default value is 4. \n4. cascade.clusteringCommandPrototype/cascade.custJack.custJackClust: These commands are used to define the clustering parameters of CD-hit. User can define a sequence identity threshold for the protein sequence clustering (refer CDhit for other options). \n5. cascade.maxQueries: User can define the maximum number of hits to be used for initiating next generation of C-HMM in this parameter. To include all the collected hits leave this option blank. By default C-HMM uses 1000 random hits. \n6. cascade.continuation: User can reinitiate cascade searches from the results of previous generation using this option. By default this option is set to \"no\". To continue sequence searches turn it to \"yes\". \n7. cascade.continuedGeneration: User has to define the name of generation from which to reinitiate sequence searches. For eg. if you want to start from third generation than cascade.continuedGeneration=3. \n8. cascade.continuationPrevGenOutput: In this parameter user has to describe the path of previous generation output files. For eg. if you want to restart third generation, give path of the output of second generation. \n"
