The format of the files are same as above (explained under the \"FirstRuns\" folder).\n    \n* \"FeatureVectors\" (This folder is not available under the DEEPred repository. It should be downloaded from [here](http://goo.gl/Kd7FkU))\n    * Includes feature vector files that belong to the training and test proteins.\n    * For example, \"Parsed_PAACFeatures_uniprot_training_test_set.txt\" file contains PAAC feature vectors and \"Parsed_BPSPMAPFeatures_CAFA2.txt\" file contains SPMAP feature vectors for BP CAFA benchmark protein sequences.\n    * In these files, each row contains the protein's UniProt accession, followed by the dimensions of the feature vector in  tab-delimited format.\n    \n* \"TrainTestDatasets\"\n    * Includes training and test proteins' UniProt identifiers given individually for each GO term.\n    * There are three zip files under this directory (one file for each GO category).\n    * These files are unzipped into individual folders, which include two files (train and test) for each GO term trained in the corresposding category.\n    * Example: \"train_GO:0043175.ids\" and \"test_GO:0043175.ids\".\n    \n* \"ElectronicAnnotationTrainingDatasets\"\n    * Includes training and test proteins' UniProt identifiers given individually for each GO term, which were used in the manual experimental + electronic annotations (i.e., all annotations) training test.\n    * There is a single zip file under this directory. This file is unzipped into a folder, which include two files (train and test) for each trained GO term (proteins annotated with all evidence codes).\n    * Example: \"train_GO:0032553.ids\" and \"test_GO:0032553.ids\".\n    \n* \"Annots\" (This folder is not available under the DEEPred repository. It should be downloaded from [here](http://goo.gl/Kd7FkU))\n    * Includes various merged training and test annotation files.\n    * Inside the files under this directory, GO terms and their annotated proteins are not separated into individual files (they are merged).\n    * For example, all manual experimental annotations are stored in  \"all_categories_manual_experimental_annots_29_08_2017_Propagated.tsv\" file and all annotations (including electronic annotations) are stored in \"all_categories_all_annots_29_08_2017_Propagated.tsv\" file.\n    * This folder also includes CAFA2 target protein files.\n\n\n         "
