One or more taxonomic profiles to be assessed\n\nFiles must be in the [CAMI profiling Bioboxes format](https://github.com/bioboxes/rfc/tree/master/data-format) or in the [BIOM (Biological Observation Matrix) format](http://biom-format.org/). Program [_tsv2biom.py_](#running-tsv2biompy) allows to convert profiles from the former format to the latter.\n\n**The BIOM format**\n\nThe BIOM format used by OPAL is a sparse matrix stored in a JSON or HDF5 file, with a column per sample and a row per taxonomy ID, storing the corresponding abundances. RANK, TAXPATH, and TAXPATHSN are stored as metadata of each row and have the same meaning as in the CAMI profiling Bioboxes format:\n* RANK: taxonomic rank\n* TAXPATH and TAXPATHSN: path from the root of the taxonomy to the respective current taxon, including the current taxon, separated by a `|`. TAXPATH and TAXPATHSN contain identifiers and plain names, respectively, of the taxonomies.

Several Bioboxes are already available on Docker Hub (see [Examples page](EXAMPLES.md)). \n\nTo build your own Biobox, general instructions are available at <http://bioboxes.org/>. Most importantly, the Biobox of a profiler must satisfy specific input and output formats (see section [Inputs](#inputs) above). Helpful examples of scripts and Dockerfiles are available at <https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/docker_profiling_tools>.\n\nOPAL's tools to measure runtime and maximum main memory usage are:\n\n* `opal_stats.py:` Runs the Biobox of a taxonomic profiler and tracks its runtime and main memory usage.\n\n* `opal_workflow.py:` Runs the Bioboxes of one of more taxonomic profilers, tracks their runtimes and main memory usages using `opal_stats.py`, and automatically assesses their results with `opal.py`.\n\nSee example usage of these tools in the [Examples page](EXAMPLES.md).\n\nRuntimes and memory usages can also be manually provided to `opal.py` using options `--time` and `--memory`. They will then be incorporated in the results files and the HTML report.\n"
