By default, `-x splice`\nassumes the read orientation relative to the transcript strand is unknown. It\ntries two rounds of alignment to infer the orientation and write the strand to\nthe `ts` SAM/PAF tag if possible. For Iso-seq, Direct RNA-seq and tranditional\nfull-length cDNAs, it would be desired to apply `-u f` to force minimap2 to\nconsider the forward transcript strand only. This speeds up alignment with\nslight improvement to accuracy. For noisy Nanopore Direct RNA-seq reads, it is\nrecommended to use a smaller k-mer size for increased sensitivity to the first\nor the last exons.\n\nMinimap2 rates an alignment by the score of the max-scoring sub-segment,\n*excluding* introns, and marks the best alignment as primary in SAM. When a\nspliced gene also has unspliced pseudogenes, minimap2 does not intentionally\nprefer spliced alignment, though in practice it more often marks the spliced\nalignment as the primary. By default, minimap2 outputs up to five secondary\nalignments (i.e. likely pseudogenes in the context of RNA-seq mapping). This\ncan be tuned with option **-N**.\n\nFor long RNA-seq reads, minimap2 may produce chimeric alignments potentially\ncaused by gene fusions/structural variations or by an intron longer than the\nmax intron length **-G** (200k by default). For now, it is not recommended to\napply an excessively large **-G** as this slows down minimap2 and sometimes\nleads to false alignments.\n\nIt is worth noting that by default `-x splice` prefers GT[A/G]..[C/T]AG\nover GT[C/T]..[A/G]AG, and then over other splicing signals. Considering\none additional base improves the junction accuracy for noisy reads, but\nreduces the accuracy when aligning against the widely used SIRV control data.\nThis is because SIRV does not honor the evolutionarily conservative splicing\nsignal. If you are studying SIRV, you may apply `--splice-flank=no` to let\nminimap2 only model GT..AG, ignoring the additional base.\n\nSince v2.17, minimap2 can optionally take annotated genes as input and\nprioritize on annotated splice junctions. To use this feature, you can \n```sh\npaftools.js gff2bed anno.gff > anno.bed\nminimap2 -ax splice --junc-bed anno.bed ref.fa query.fa > aln.sam\n```\nHere, `anno.gff` is the gene annotation in the GTF or GFF3 format (`gff2bed`\nautomatically tests the format). The output of `gff2bed` is in the 12-column\nBED format, or the BED12 format. With the `--junc-bed` option, minimap2 adds a\nbonus score (tuned by `--junc-bonus`) if an aligned junction matches a junction\nin the annotation. Option `--junc-bed` also takes 5-column BED, including the\nstrand field. In this case, each line indicates an oriented junction.\n"

It is an extension to `cs`. The\r\n   `mgutils-es6.js` script in minigraph parses `ds`.\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: avoided a NULL pointer dereference (#1154). This would not have an\r\n   effect on most systems but would still be good to fix.\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: reverted the value of `ms:i` to pre-2.22 versions (#1146). This was\r\n   an oversight.

        "description": "This release includes a few important improvements backported from unimap:\r\n\r\n * Improvement: more contiguous alignment through long INDELs. This is enabled\r\n   by the minigraph chaining algorithm. All `asm*` presets now use the new\r\n   algorithm. They can find INDELs up to 100kb and may be faster for\r\n   chromosome-long contigs. The default mode and `map*` presets use this\r\n   algorithm to replace the long-join heuristic.\r\n\r\n * Improvement: better alignment in highly repetitive regions by rescuing\r\n   high-occurrence seeds. If the distance between two adjacent seeds is too\r\n   large, attempt to choose a fraction of high-occurrence seeds in-between.\r\n   Minimap2 now produces fewer clippings and alignment break points in long\r\n   satellite regions.\r\n\r\n * Improvement: allow to specify an interval of k-mer occurrences with `-U`.\r\n   For repeat-rich genomes, the automatic k-mer occurrence threshold determined\r\n   by `-f` may be too large and makes alignment impractically slow. The new\r\n   option protects against such cases. Enabled for `asm*` and `map-hifi`.\r\n\r\n * New feature: added the `map-hifi` preset for mapping PacBio High-Fidelity\r\n   (HiFi) reads.\r\n\r\n * Change to the default: apply `--cap-sw-mem=100m` for genomic alignment.\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: minimap2 could not generate an index file with `-xsr` (#734).\r\n\r\nThis release represents the most significant algorithmic change since v2.1 in\r\n2017. With features backported from unimap, minimap2 now has similar power to\r\nunimap for contig alignment. Unimap will remain an experimental project and is\r\nno longer recommended over minimap2.

This led\r\n   to issues when the BED name column contains spaces.\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: minimap2 `--split-prefix` did not work with long reference names\r\n   (#394).\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: option `--junc-bonus` didn't work (#513)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: minimap2 didn't return 1 on I/O errors (#532)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: the `de:f` tag (sequence divergence) could be negative if there were\r\n   ambiguous bases\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: fixed two undefined behaviors caused by calling memcpy() on\r\n   zero-length blocks (#443)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: there were duplicated SAM `@SQ` lines if option `--split-prefix` is in\r\n   use (#400 and #527)\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: option -K had to be smaller than 2 billion (#491). This was caused\r\n   by a 32-bit integer overflow.\r\n\r\n * Improvement: optionally compile against SIMDe (#597). Minimap2 should work\r\n   with IBM POWER CPUs, though this has not been tested. To compile with SIMDe,\r\n   please use `make -f Makefile.simde`.\r\n\r\n * Improvement: more informative error message for I/O errors (#454) and for\r\n   FASTQ parsing errors (#510)\r\n\r\n * Improvement: abort given malformatted RG line (#541)\r\n\r\n * Improvement: better formula to estimate the `dv:f` tag (approximate sequence\r\n   divergence). See DOI:10.1101/2021.01.15.426881.\r\n\r\n * New feature: added the `--mask-len` option to fine control the removal of\r\n   redundant hits (#659). The default behavior is unchanged.\r\n\r\nChanges to mappy:\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: mappy caused segmentation fault if the reference index is not\r\n   present (#413).\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: fixed a memory leak via 238b6bb3\r\n\r\n * Change: always require Cython to compile the mappy module (#723). Older\r\n   mappy packages at PyPI bundled the C source code generated by Cython such\r\n   that end users did not need to install Cython to compile mappy. However, as\r\n   Python 3.9 is breaking backward compatibility, older mappy does not work\r\n   with Python 3.9 anymore. We have to add this Cython dependency as a\r\n   workaround.\r\n\r\nChanges to paftools.js:\r\n\r\n * Bugfix: the \"part10-\" line from asmgene was wrong (#581)\r\n\r\n * Improvement: compatibility with GTF files from GenBank (#422)\r\n\r\n * New feature: asmgene also checks missing multi-copy genes\r\n\r\n * New feature: added the misjoin command to evaluate large-scale misjoins and\r\n   megabase-long inversions.\r\n\r\nAlthough given the many bug fixes and minor improvements, the core algorithm\r\nstays the same. This version of minimap2 produces nearly identical alignments\r\nto v2.17 except very rare corner cases.\r\n\r\nNow unimap is recommended over minimap2 for aligning long contigs against a\r\nreference genome. It often takes less wall-clock time and is much more\r\nsensitive to long insertions and deletions.\r\n\r\n(2.18: 9 April 2021, r1015)",

For short-read mapping, long-read overlapping and ordinary long-read\r\nmapping, the performance and accuracy remain similar.

The\r\n   hidden option is available in earlier minimap2 but had a different 2-column\r\n   output format instead of PAF.\r\n\r\n * Fixed a bug that leads to wrongly calculated `de` tags when ambiguous bases\r\n   are involved (#309).

        "description": "As is planned, this release focuses on fine tuning the base algorithm. Notable\r\nchanges include\r\n\r\n * Changed the mapping quality scale to match the scale of BWA-MEM. This makes\r\n   minimap2 and BWA-MEM achieve similar sensitivity-specificity balance on real\r\n   short-read data.\r\n\r\n * Improved the accuracy of splice alignment by modeling one additional base\r\n   close to the GT-AG signal. This model is used by default with `-x splice`.\r\n   For SIRV control data, however, it is recommended to add `--splice-flank=no`\r\n   to disable this feature as the SIRV splice signals are slightly different.\r\n\r\n * Tuned the parameters for Nanopore Direct RNA reads. The recommended command\r\n   line is `-axsplice -k14 -uf` (#46).\r\n\r\n * Fixed a segmentation fault when aligning PacBio reads (#47 and #48). This\r\n   bug is very rare but it affects all versions of minimap2. It is also\r\n   recommended to re-index reference genomes created with `map-pb`. For human,\r\n   two minimizers in an old index are wrong.\r\n\r\n * Changed option `-L` in sync with the final decision of hts-specs: a fake\r\n   CIGAR takes the form of `<readLen>S<refLen>N`. Note that `-L` only enables\r\n   future tools to recognize long CIGARs. It is not possible for older tools to\r\n   work with such alignments in BAM (#43 and #51).\r\n\r\n * Fixed a tiny issue whereby minimap2 may waste 8 bytes per candidate\r\n   alignment.\r\n\r\nThe minimap2 [technical note][1] has also been updated to reflect recent changes.\r\n\r\n(2.4: 6 November 2017, r555)\r\n\r\n[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01492",

Minimap2 is\r\n   3-4 times as fast as BWA-MEM, but is slightly less accurate on simulated\r\n   reads.\r\n\r\n * Meticulous improvements to assembly-to-assembly alignment (special thanks to\r\n   Alexey Gurevich from the QUAST team): a) apply a small penalty to matches\r\n   between ambiguous bases; b) reduce missing alignments due to spurious\r\n   overlaps; c) introduce the short form of the `cs` tag, an improvement to the\r\n   SAM MD tag.\r\n\r\n * Make sure gaps are always left-aligned.\r\n\r\n * Recognize `U` bases from Oxford Nanopore Direct RNA-seq (#33).\r\n\r\n * Fixed slightly wrong chaining score. Fixed slightly inaccurate coordinates\r\n   for split alignment.\r\n\r\n * Fixed multiple reported bugs: 1) wrong reference name for inversion\r\n   alignment (#30); 2) redundant SQ lines when multiple query files are\r\n   specified (#39); 3) non-functioning option `-K` (#36).\r\n\r\nThis release has implemented all the major features I planned five months ago,\r\nplus the addition of spliced long-read alignment.

        "description": "This is a feature release. It improves single-end short-read alignment and\r\ncomes with Python bindings.

In this mode,\r\n   minimap2 runs faster than BWA-MEM, but is slightly less accurate on\r\n   simulated data sets. Paired-end alignment is not supported as of now.\r\n\r\n * Improved mapping quality estimate with more accurate identification of\r\n   repetitive hits. This mainly helps short-read alignment.\r\n\r\n * Implemented **mappy**, a Python binding for minimap2, which is available\r\n   from PyPI and can be installed with `pip install --user mappy`. Python users\r\n   can perform read alignment without the minimap2 executable.\r\n\r\n * Restructured the indexing APIs and documented key minimap2 APIs in the\r\n   header file minimap.h. Updated example.c with the new APIs. Old APIs still\r\n   work but may become deprecated in future.\r\n\r\nThis release may output alignments different from the previous version, though\r\nthe overall alignment statistics, such as the number of aligned bases and long\r\ngaps, remain close.\r\n\r\n(2.2: 17 September 2017, r409)\r\n",
