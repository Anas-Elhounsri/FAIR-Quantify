There is a much stronger coverage bias towards the end of the transcript in 3' GEX data, which poses a problem for genotyping and molecule counting of class I genes because most of the variable sites between these three paralogs are contained in exons 2 and 3, which are at the 5' end of the transcript. The following figure shows the coverage profile for 5', 3'v2 and 3'v3 GEX assays, normalized to 0 and 1 for the minimum and maximum coverage seen in the region, respectively, for each assay. \n"

Although 5' and 3' Gene Expression read coverage is highly skewed towards one end of the transcript (see [Limitations](#using-schlacount)) we have found that combining reads from all cells has enough coverage along the length of the transcript to achieve similar results to those demonstrated in bulk RNA-seq.  \nWe use the `Allele_status.txt` metadata file from the IMGT/HLA database to select the full-length coding sequences of alleles from hla_nuc.fasta for genes HLA-A, -B, -C, DPA1, DPB1, DRA1, DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 in the IMGT HLA database that also have complete genomic sequences available. We exclude null alleles (with suffix of N) because by definition, we would never call these genotypes from RNA sequencing data. A colored deBruijn graph of these alleles is constructed using k-mer size 24.  We build on the Rust [debruijn_mapping](https://github.com/10XGenomics/rust-pseudoaligner) crate. From the aligned BAM file, all reads aligned to the MHC region (default is GRCh38 coordinates 6:28510120-33480577) are pseudo-aligned to the graph, and the set of alleles to which they align (''equivalence class'') is reported, if the length of the alignment is at least 40 bases, with up to 2 mismatches permitted outside the initial seed. Expectation maximization (EM) is performed on the equivalence class counts, with the accelerated implementation SquareM of Varadhan and Roland (Scandinavian J of Statistics, 2008).  \nFor each of the eight HLA genes included in the graph, we rank the alleles of that gene by weight in the EM. To determine the diploid genotype, we consider all pairs of alleles that explained at least 100 reads (a pair of alleles explains a read if the read pseudoaligned to an equivalence class containing either allele sequence). We select the pair of alleles that explain the most reads, if the number of reads explained by the 2nd allele alone is at least 15% of the reads explained by the 1st allele. If this is not true, we report only a single genotype: the highest ranked by weight in the EM. For each gene, we report the top 5 allele pairs ranked by number of reads explained, and the top 10 alleles ranked by EM weight in an auxiliary output file, found in the pseudoaligner temporary folder specified by the `--pl-tmp` parameter. This metadata is useful to gauge confidence in the reported genotypes compared to other contenders. The coding sequence of the allele or pair from `hla_nuc.fasta` and the genomic sequence from `hla_gen.fasta` (IMGT/HLA database) are written to FASTA format files for all genes.\n \n"

One graph contains coding sequences and one contains genomic sequences. From the aligned BAM file, each read aligned to the MHC region (default is GRCh38 coordinates 6:28510120-33480577) is first pseudo-aligned to the coding sequence graph. If there is no alignment of at least 60 bases (2 mismatches are permitted outside the initial seed), the read is pseudo-aligned to the genomic sequence graph and retained if the alignment is at least 60 bases. In the datasets we've studied, less than 5% of reads with any alignment were aligned to the genomic sequence. The genomic sequence step provides a failsafe for samples that are derived from nuclei, haplotypes with short CDS assemblies in the database, and the occasional read from intronic or UTR sequences. \nReads are then collated by molecule, which in 10x Genomics data comprises the 12bp cell barcode (CB) and 10bp unique molecular identifier (UMI). All reads sharing a CB and UMI originated from the same RNA molecule, but individual reads may have different equivalence classes according to the pseudoalignment. We only retain reads where the equivalence class corresponds to a single allele (in which case the read is assigned to that allele; e.g. HLA-A*02:01) or the two alleles of the same gene (the read is assigned to the gene; e.g. HLA-A). If at least half of the reads from a molecule are assigned to a particular gene, the molecule is assigned to that gene or one of its alleles using a consensus of the constituent reads\u2019 equivalence classes. Now only considering the reads from the molecule assigned to the most prevalent gene, if both or neither allele have at least 10% of the reads, the molecule is assigned to the gene.

Follow the template at `paper/sample_gt.txt`. \n4. We strongly recommend that if genotypes are unknown for any of the genes, you put the reference genome allele for those genes in the known genotypes file. Alleles represented in the GRCh38 primary assembly are listed below:\n```\nA*03:01:01:01\nB*07:02:01:01\nC*07:02:01:01\nDQA1*01:02:01:01\nDQB1*06:02:01:01\nDRB1*15:01:01:01\nDPA1*01:03:01:01\nDPB1*04:01:01:01\n```\n5. If the indexed IMGT/HLA database files are not in the current directory, edit the `prepare_reference.sh` file to point to these files.\n6. Run `prepare_reference.sh known_genotypes.txt` to get your custom references `cds.fasta` and `gen.fasta`. The samtools command will fail if the coding and genomic sequence of all alleles specified are not present in the database! If multiple alleles are present that match the provided level of specificity of the genotype, one will be chosen arbitrarily.\n7. Run scHLAcount with the custom references as `-f` and `-g` parameters. Do not use the `-i` and `-d` parameters. \n"
