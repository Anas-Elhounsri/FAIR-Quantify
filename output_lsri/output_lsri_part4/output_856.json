Otherwise, you can\neither follow the instructions from bioconda, or if you're on Ubuntu\n(or most GNU/Linux platforms), install it directly into your home folder\nwith:\n\n    wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh && bash miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda\n    echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH\"' >> $HOME/.bashrc\n\n## Installing Dammit\n\nIt's recommended that you use conda environments to\nseparate your packages, though it isn't strictly necessary:\n\n    conda create -n dammit python=3\n    source activate dammit\n\nNow, add the channels and install dammit:\n\n    conda config --add channels defaults\n    conda config --add channels conda-forge\n    conda config --add channels bioconda\n\n    conda install dammit\n"

        "description": "This version includes several new command line options, a new FASTA output, and a major refactor of the under the hood. For end users, the relevant changes are:\n- An annotated FASTA file, named like `<transcriptome_filename>.dammit.fasta`, which has a summary of the annotations in the headers and renamed transcript IDs.\n- A `--name` option specifying how to rename the transcript IDs in the FASTA header.\n- A CSV file mapping the new names back to the original names, stored as `<transcriptome_filename>.names.csv`\n- A `--evalue` option specifying the evalue cutoff to pass to HMMER, Infernal, crb-blast, and LAST.\n\nFor developers, the most significant changes can be found in the `AnnotetateHandler` class in `annotate.py`. Each set of tasks has been put into a separate method, and the `get_tasks()` method is now an iterator over all those tasks. Furthermore, the output filenames are now all stored as attributes on the `AnnotateHandler` instead of in a results dictionary. The result is that it is now easier to remix this class, which is a necessary step toward a future API for accessing dammit results in Python with the pydata stack.\n\nAs usual, dammit can be upgraded with:\n\n```\npip install dammit --upgrade\n```\n\nUsers having problems with database dependencies should try removing their `databases.doit.db` file in their databases directory; additionally, resume functionality will fail for runs done with older versions of dammit, as the renamed transcriptome file is a dependency for almost all the tasks (so, take caution with older runs). Conveniently, execution of HMMER in particular is _much_ faster now that their is a sane e-value cutoff, so rerunning older analyses is less prohibitive.\n\nFor any other problems, please file an issue on the tracker!\n",
