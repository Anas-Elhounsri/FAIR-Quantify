It's main features are: \n- Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step\n- Supports single-end and paired-end read alignments\n- Supports ungapped, gapped or spliced alignments\n- Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are adjustable\n- Output discriminates between cytosine methylation in `CpG`, `CHG` and `CHH` context\n \n"

To install Bismark simply copy the bismark_v0.X.Y.tar.gz file into a Bismark installation folder and extract all files by typing:\n\n```bash\ntar xzf bismark_v0.X.Y.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBismark requires a working of Perl and [Bowtie 2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2) (or [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml)) to be installed on your machine. Bismark will assume that the Bowtie 2/ HISAT2 executable is in your path unless the path to Bowtie/ HISAT2 is specified manually with:\n\n```\n--path_to_bowtie2 </../../bowtie2> or\n--path_to_hisat2 </../../hisat2>\n```\n\n## Hardware requirements\n\nBismark holds the reference genome in memory, and in addition to that runs up to four parallel instances of Bowtie 2. The memory usage is dependent on the size of the reference genome. For a large eukaryotic genome (human or mouse) we experienced a typical memory usage of around 12GB. We thus recommend running Bismark on a machine with 5 CPU cores and at least 12 GB of RAM. The memory requirements of Bowtie 2 are somewhat larger (possibly to allow gapped alignments). When running Bismark using Bowtie 2 we therefore recommend a system with at least 5 cores and > 16GB of RAM.\n\nAlignment speed depends largely on the read length and alignment parameters used. Allowing many mismatches and using a short seed length tends to be fairly slow.\n\n## BS-Seq test data set\n\nA test BS-Seq data set is available for download from the Bismark project or Github pages. It contains 10,000 single- end shotgun BS reads from human ES cells in FastQ format (from SRR020138, Lister et al., 2009; trimmed to 50 bp; base call qualities are Sanger encoded Phred values (Phred33)).\n\n### Bismark reports for the test data set\n\nPlease note that this has been run with a fairly early version however I wouldn't expect the numbers to change much.\n\n#### Using Bowtie 2:\n\nRunning Bismark with the following options:\n\n```bash\nbismark --score-min L,0,-0.6 /data/public/Genomes/Human/GRCh37/ test_data.fastq\n```\n\nShould result in this mapping report:\n\n```\nBismark report for: test_data.fastq (version: v0.7.8)\nOption '--directional' specified: alignments to complementary strands will be ignored (i.e. not performed!)\nBowtie2 was run against the bisulfite genome of /data/public/Genomes/Human/GRCh37/ with the specified options: -q -- score-min L,0,-0.6 --ignore-quals\n\nFinal Alignment report\n======================\nSequences analysed in total: 10000\n\nNumber of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments: 5658 Mapping efficiency: 56.6%\nSequences with no alignments under any condition: 2893\nSequences did not map uniquely: 1449\nSequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted: 0\nNumber of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total: 0\n\nNumber of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:\n\nCT/CT: 2820 ((converted) top strand)\nCT/GA: 2838 ((converted) bottom strand)\nGA/CT: 0    (complementary to (converted) top strand)\nGA/GA: 0    (complementary to (converted) bottom strand)\n\nFinal Cytosine Methylation Report\n=================================\nTotal number of C's analysed: 45985\n\nTotal methylated C's in CpG context: 1550\nTotal methylated C's in CHG context: 34\nTotal methylated C's in CHH context: 126\n\nTotal C to T conversions in CpG context: 844\nTotal C to T conversions in CHG context: 11368\nTotal C to T conversions in CHH context:32063\n\nC methylated in CpG context: 64.7%\nC methylated in CHG context: 0.3%\nC methylated in CHH context: 0.4%\n```\n"

        "description": "### Bismark\r\n\r\n- Added new option `--strandID` which reports the alignment strand identity for paired-end, non-directional libraries, e.g. `YS:Z:CTOT`. This information may be difficult to obtain if third party tools interfered with the read ordering (admittedly there is a fine balance of read reporting position, FLAG, Read 1 and Genome conversion state to make it work in the first place. More information can be found in [this thread](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/455)). \r\n\r\n- runs with `--parallel/--multicore` > 1 specified will now terminate with an error message whenever one of the child processes fails. This prevents potentially incomplete result files making it through to the end unnoticed (more [#494](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/494))\r\n\r\n- runs with `--parallel/--multicore` > 1 as well as `--unmapped` and/or `--ambiguous` specified will no longer produce potentially corrupt FastQ files (more [#495](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/495))\r\n\r\n- Added option `--mm2/--minimap2` to use [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) as the underlying aligner. The minimap2 alignment modes include Oxford Nanopore, PacBio and accurate short reads. In its current implementation, minimap2 can be invoked in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\n- `--mm2_nanopore`: Sets preset settings for Oxford Nanopore vs reference mapping '-x map-ont' [default]\r\n\r\n- `--mm2_pacbio`: Sets preset settings for PacBio vs. reference mapping '-x map-pb' \r\n\r\n- `--mm2_short_reads`: Sets preset settings for accurate short reads '-x sr'\r\n\r\n- added option `--mm2_maximum_length <int>` to set a maximum length cutoff, which might be required for very long reads exceeding the maximum number of CIGAR operations tolerated by the BAM formatted reads (>65535). The default is 10,000 bp.\r\n\r\nOther options that are currently set within Bismark include '-a' (SAM output), '--MD' (MD tag), '--secondary=no'.\r\n\r\nPrompted by fairly slow alignment speeds with the minimap2 default settings, we set out to improve the performance of the alignment process by tweaking several different parameters \r\n\r\nSpeed optimisiation: [optimisation of minimap2 parameters](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/446)\r\n\r\n**k-mer size** \r\nDue to the reduced DNA alphabet the minimap2 default k-mer size of 15 leads to substantially higher alignment times. Based on our tests we settled for a new default of \u2018-k 20\u2019\r\n**minibatch size** \r\nThe minimap2 default minibatch size of 500 million bp means that a substantial amount of data is aligned and held in memory before additional alignment threads can be started. Reducing the minibatch size to 250K reads seemed to be a good compromise (\u2018-K 250K\u2019).\r\n**minimap2 multi-threading**\r\nminimap2 alignments may utilize multiple cores for each alignment process; we found that \u2018-t 2\u2019 offered a good speed-up, while allowing additional resources had diminishing returns.\r\n**Bismark multi-threading**\r\nWe also tested the potential of using additional resources for Bismark itself (--parallel), which appeared to result in a speed-up of the alignment process as expected; however this comes at the cost of requiring additional system resources.\r\n \r\nAs a result of these tests, we changed the default settings for minimap2 alignment parameters to \u2018-t 2 -k 20 -K 250K\u2019.\r\n \r\n### methylation_consistency\r\n\r\n- Added new option `--chh` to use cytosines in CHH instead of CpG context to enable some trouble shooting and method development\r\n\r\n### bismark2report\r\n\r\n- The CHH/CHG labels for the Cytosine Methylation after Extraction plot now appear in the correct order\r\n\r\n### bismark_methylation_extractor\r\n\r\n- removed a print statement that would flood STDOUT the logfile if `--merge_non_CG` (but not `--comprehensive`) had been selected\r\n\r\n- runs with `--parallel/--multicore` specified will now terminate with an error message whenever one of the child processes fails. This prevents potentially incomplete result files making it through to the end unnoticed\r\n\r\n- changed the option `-o/--output` to `-o/--output_dir` for consistency reasons... \r\n\r\n### bismark_genome_preparation\r\n\r\n- Added option `--mm2/--minimap2`. The genome indexing process (`bismark_genome_preparation`) writes out a minimap2 index to the genome folder, using the optimized k-mer size of `-k 20` (see comments for bismark itself). This pre-generated minimap2 index takes precedence over indexing options that would otherwise happen as part of the alignment procedure.\r\n\r\n### deduplicate_bismark\r\n\r\n- when using an output filename `-o customname` the deduplication report will also be derived from customname.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdded a sentence to the Docs that Genozip 14 and above supports Bismark BAM files (with a substantial gain in compression).",

        "description": "# Bismark Release v0.23.0\r\n\r\n- Migrated CI tests from Travis to Github Actions\r\n\r\n### deduplicate_bismark\r\n\r\n- the command `deduplicate_bismark --barcode *bam` now works again. Previously the output file names were accidentally all derived from the first supplied file in `--barcode` (= UMI) mode (it had been fixed for normal files in 0.22.2).\r\n\r\n- Changed the way the library auto-detection works to only look at the `@PG ID:Bismark` line of the SAM header (to only look for the Bismark command)\r\n\r\n### bismark_methylation_extractor / bismark2bedGraph\r\n\r\n- Added a new option `--ucsc` to `bismark2bedGraph` and `bismark_methylation_extractor` that will produce a UCSC-ready bedGraph file if the genome version used came from Ensembl. This option (i) prefixes chromosome names with 'chr', and (ii) changes the mitochondrial chromosome from 'MT' to 'chrM'. In addition, it will also write out a new file ending in `.chromosome_sizes.txt` for easier use of [`bedGraphToBigWig`](https://www.encodeproject.org/software/bedgraphtobigwig/). [More here](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/371).\r\n\r\n- Changed the way the library auto-detection works to only look at the `@PG ID:Bismark` line of the SAM header. \r\n\r\n### coverage2cytosine\r\n\r\n- Added a new output file for all cytosine context methylation totals. More information here: [#321](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/321).\r\n\r\n- Added new option `--drach/--m6A`. Most `m6A` sites are found in the conserved sequence motif `DRACH` (where `D`=`G`/`A`/`U`, `R`=`G`/`A`, `H`=`A`/`U`/`C`), and if bound by anti-m6A antibody, it causes the reverse transcriptase to introduce `C` to `T` transitions at the cytosine which follows `A` in the `DRACH` motif. This option also sets a coverage threshold of at 1 unless specified explicitly. This is a very specialised option and should only be used by experimentalists looking at `m6A` methylation (where the C to T transition acts as a proxy of `m6A`).\r\n\r\n### bismark2summary\r\n\r\n- Samples with absolutely 0 methylation calls in some context are now excluded from the graphical HTML output (as they break rendering the entire summary graph section). These samples and their statistics do still appear in the file `bismark_summary_report.txt`.  More information here: [#315](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/315).\r\n \r\n",

        "description": "Expanding on our observation that single-cell BS-seq, or PBAT libraries in general, can [generate chimeric read pairs](\r\nhttps://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/pbat-libraries-may-generate-chimaeric-read-pairs/), a recent publication by [Wu et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30859188) described in further detail that intra-fragment chimeras can hinder the efficient alignment of single-cell BS-seq libraries. In there, the authors described a pipeline that uses paired-end alignments first, followed by a second, single-end alignment step that uses local alignments in a bid to improve the mapping of intra-molecular chimeras. To allow this type of improvement for single-cell or PBAT libraries, we have been experimenting with allowing local alignments. \r\n\r\n**Please note** that we still do not recommend using local alignments as a means to *magically* increase mapping efficiencies (please see [here](https://sequencing.qcfail.com/articles/soft-clipping-of-reads-may-add-potentially-unwanted-alignments-to-repetitive-regions/)), but we do acknowledge that PBAT/scBSs-seq/scNMT-seq are exceptional applications where local alignments might indeed make a difference (there is only so much data to be had from a single cell...). \r\nWe didn't have the time yet to set more appropriate or stringent default values for local alignments (suggestions welcome), nor did we investigate whether the methylation extraction will require an additional `--ignore` flag if a read was found to the be soft-clipped (the so called 'micro-homology domains'). This might be added in the near future.\r\n\r\n### Bismark\r\n\r\n- Added support for local alignments by introducing the new option `--local`. This means that the CIGAR operation `S` (soft-clipping) is now supported\r\n\r\n- fixed typo in option `--path_to_bowtie2` (a single missing `2` was preventing the specified path to be accepted)\r\n\r\n- fixed typo in option `--no-spliced-alignment` in HISAT2 mode\r\n\r\n- fixed missing end-of-line character for unmapped or ambiguous FastQ sequences in paired-end FastQ mode\r\n\r\n- fixed output file naming in `--hisat2` and `--parallel` mode (\\_hisat2 was missing in `--parallel` mode). Thanks to @phue for spotting this.\r\n\r\n### bismark_genome_preparation\r\n\r\n- Added option `--large-index` to force the generation of LARGE genome indexes. This may be required for indexing extremely large genomes (e.g. the Axolotl (32 GigaBases)) in `--parallel` mode.

        "description": "For the upcoming version Bismark has undergone some substantial changes, which sometimes affect more than one module within the Bismark suite. Here is a short description of the major changes: \r\n\r\n### [Retired]: Bowtie 1 support\r\n- `Bowtie (1)` support, and all of its options, has been completely dropped from `bismark_genome_preparation` and `bismark`. This decision was not made lightly, but it seems no one is using the original Bowtie short read aligner anymore, even short reads have moved on...\r\n- Consequently, the option `--vanilla` and its handling has been removed from a number of modules (`bismark_genome_preparation`, `bismark`, `bismark_methylation_extractor` and `deduplicate_bismark`). Too bad, I liked that name...\r\n\r\n### [Added]: HISAT2 support\r\n- Instead, the DNA and RNA aligner [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) has been added as a new choice of aligner. The reason for this is not necessarily that RNA methylation is now a thing, but certain alignment modes (see below) do require splice-aware mapping if we don't want to miss out on a whole class of (spliced) alignments. Bowtie 2 is the default mode, HISAT2 alignments can be enabled with the option `--hisat2`\r\n\r\n- Similar to the Bowtie2 mode, alignments with HISAT2 are restricted to global (end-to-end) alignments, i.e. soft-clipping is disabled. Furthermore, in paired-end mode, the options `--no-mixed` and `--no-discordant` are permanently enabled, meaning that only properly aligned read pairs are put out. \r\n\r\n- As the `--hisat2` mode supports spliced alignments, the new `CIGAR` operation `N` is now supported in all Bismark modules (this includes `bismark_genome_preparation`, `bismark`, `bismark_methylation_extractor`, `deduplicate_bismark` and some others).\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing this, the `--hisat2` mode appears to be working as expected. It should be mentioned however that we have not done a lot of testing of these new files, so comments and feedback are welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n### SLAM-seq mode\r\n\r\nWe also added a new, experimental and completely different type of alignment for SLAM-seq type data (option `--slam`). This fairly recent method to interrogate newly synthesized messenger RNA is akin to bisulfite conversion, in that newly synthesized RNA may contain T to C conversions following an alkylation reaction ([original publication](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/800) and https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4435). The new Bismark alignment mode `--slam` performs T>C conversions of both the genome (in the genome preparation step) and the subsequent alignment steps (Bismark alignment step). Currently, the rest of the processing of SLAM-seq data hijacks the standard methylation pipeline:\r\n    \r\n- T>C conversions are written out as `methylation events` in CpG context, while T-T matches are scored as `unmethylated events` in CpG context. Other cytosine contexts are not being used. \r\n\r\nSo in a nut-shell: methylation calls in `--slam` mode are either Ts (unmethylated calls = matches at T positions), or T to C mismatches (methylated calls = C mismatches at T positions). \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this is currently an **experimental workflow**. One might argue that T/C conversion aware (or T/C mis-mapping agnostic) mapping is currently not necessary for [SLAM-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4435), [NASC-Seq](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/498667v1.article-info), or [scSLAM-seq](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/486852v1) data as the labeling reaction is very inefficient (1 in only 50 to 200 newly incorporated Ts is a 4sU, which may get alkylated). This might be true - for now. If and when the conversion reaction improves over time, C/T agnostic mapping, similar to bisulfite-Seq data, might very well become necessary.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of a comparison of aligning the same data (SLAM-seq-like) with Bismark in Bowtie 2 mode (top track) and HISAT2 mode (middle track). Alignments with HISAT2 recover a lot more alignments to short exons, as well as exon-exon spanning reads (evidenced in bottom track):\r\n\r\n![Bowtie2 HISAT2 aligment comparison](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/blob/master/Docs/Images/Bismark_Bowtie2_HISAT2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n* Added documentation for NOMe-seq or scNMT-seq processing.\r\n\r\n## bismark\r\n\r\n- Dropped support for Bowtie\r\n\r\n- Removed all traces of `--vanilla`\r\n\r\n- Added support for HISAT2 with option `--hisat2`.\r\n\r\n- Added HISAT2 option `--no-spliced-aligments` to disable spliced alignments altogether\r\n\r\n- Added HISAT2 option `--known-splicesite-infile <path>` to provide a list of known splice sites.\r\n\r\n- Added option `--slam` to allow T/C mismatch agnostic mapping (3-letter alignment). More [here](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#slam-seq-mode).\r\n\r\n- Added a new option `--icpc` to truncate read IDs at the first space (or tab) it encounters in the (FastQ) read ID, which are sometimes used to add comments to a FastQ entry (instead of replacing them with underscores which is the default behaviour).\r\n\r\n## bismark_genome_preparation\r\n\r\n- Dropped support for Bowtie\r\n\r\n- Added support for HISAT2 with option `--hisat2`.\r\n\r\n- Added option `--slam`. Instead of performing an in-silico bisulfite conversion, this mode transforms T to C (forward strand), or A to G (reverse strand). The folder structure and rest of the indexing process is currently exactly the same as for bisulfite sequences, but this might change at some point. This means that a genome prepared in `--slam` mode is currently indistinguishable from a true Bisulfite Genome (until the alignments are in) so please make sure you name the genome folder appropriately to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n## deduplicate_bismark\r\n\r\n* Removed all traces of `--vanilla`\r\n\r\n* `--bam` mode is now the default. Uncompressed SAM output may still be obtained using the new option `--sam`\r\n\r\n* Added new option `-o/--outfile <basename>`. This basename is then modified to remove file endings such as `.bam`, `.sam`, `.txt` or `.gz`, and `.deduplicated.bam`, or `.multiple.deduplicated.bam` in `--multiple` mode, is then appended for consistency reasons.\r\n\r\n- Added support for new CIGAR operation `N`\r\n\r\n## bismark_methylation_extractor\r\n\r\n- Added support for new CIGAR operation `N` for all extraction modes\r\n\r\n- Removed all traces of `--vanilla`\r\n\r\n## bismark2summary/bismark2report\r\n\r\n- Adapted to work with Bismark HISAT2 reports instead of Bowtie 1 reports.\r\n\r\n## bam2nuc\r\n\r\n- Reads containing spliced reads are now also skipped when determining the genomic base composition (as are reads with InDels).\r\n",

We have added warning statements to both the genome preparation and alignment steps to warn users that Bowtie1 is now deprecated. All Bowtie 1 functionality and support will disappear in a future release. Please **shout now** if you think this will be a disaster for you...\r\n\r\n## bismark\r\n\r\n- Added check to prevent users from inadvertently specifying the very same file as both R1 and R2\r\n\r\n- Added a check for file truncation, or more generally the same number of reads between R1 and R2 for paired-end FastQ files (directional, non-directional and PBAT mode).\r\n\r\n- Added Travis CI testing for most Bismark modules and commands. This should help spotting problems a early, e.g. if I release a new version right before the Christmas holidays ...\r\n\r\n- Changed error message for failed `fork` command in `--parallel` mode to `[FATAL ERROR]: ...` to alert users that something isn't working as intended.\r\n \r\n## bismark_genome_preparation\r\n\r\n- Added multi-threading to the Bowtie2-based genome preparation (thanks to Rahul Karnik)\r\n\r\n- Added test to see whether specified files exist, or die otherwise\r\n\r\n\r\n## bismark2summary\r\n\r\n- Fixed division by zero errors when a C-context was not covered by *any* reads. This will now use values of `0/0` for the context plots, which looks a bit odd, but at least it still works.\r\n\r\n- Detects if (non-deduplicated) RRBS and WGBS samples are mixed together, and bails with a meaningful error message.\r\n\r\n## bam2nuc\r\n\r\n- Changed `samtools` to `$samtools_path` during single-end/paired-end file testing.\r\n\r\n## bismark_methylation_extractor\r\n\r\n- Changed the order in which `--ample_mem` and `--buffer_size` are checked.\r\n",

Here is [issue #135](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/135).\r\n\r\n## filter_non_conversion\r\n\r\n- Added new options `--percentage_cutoff [int]` and `--minimum_count [int]` to allow filtering reads for non-bisulfite conversion using an overall methylation percentage and count cutoff. Here is [issue #122](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/122).\r\n\r\n## deduplicate_bismark\r\n\r\n- Added option `--multiple` to the deduplicator to treat several input SAM/BAM files as the same sample. Here is [issue #107](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/107).\r\n\r\n- Added option `--output_dir` to `deduplicate_bismark` so that it can be used in the Google cloud. Here is [issue #123](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/123)\r\n\r\n## coverage2cytosine\r\n\r\n- Output files are now handled better and more consistently.

CpG positions for which either the top or bottom strand was not measured at all will not be assessed for discordance and hence appear in the regular 'merged_CpG_evidence.cov' file.

        "description": "# Release Notes for Bismark v0.18.0\r\n\r\n- Changed `FindBin qw($Bin)` to `FindBin qw($RealBin)` for `bismark`, `bismark_methylation_extractor`, `bismark2report` and `bismark2summary` so that symlinks are resolved before calling different modules.\r\n\r\n### Bismark\r\n\r\n- Fixed the behaviour of (very rare) ambiguous [corner cases](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/105) where a sequence had a perfect sequence duplication within the valid paired-end distance.\r\n\r\n### Methylation Extractor\r\n\r\n- Added new option `--yacht` (for **Y**et **A**nother **C**ontext **H**unting **T**ool) that writes out additional information about the read a methylation call belongs to, and its output is meant to be fed into the NOMe_filtering script (see below). This option writes out a single 'any_C_context' file that contains all methylation calls for a read consecutively. Its intended use is single-cell NOMe-Seq data, so it only works in single-end mode (paired-end reads often suffer from chimaera problems...)\r\n\r\n`--yacht` adds three additional columns to the standard methylation call files:\r\n\r\n`<read start>  <read end>  <read orientation>`\r\n\r\nFor forward reads (+ orientation) the start position is the left-most position wheras for reverse reads (- orientation) it is the rightmost position.\r\n\r\nChanged FindBin qw($Bin) to FindBin qw($RealBin) so that symlinks are resolved before calling different modules.\r\n\r\n### NOMe_filtering\r\n\r\nThis script reads in methylation call files from the Bismark methylation extractor that contain additional information about the reads that methylation calls belonged to. It processes entire (single-end) reads and then filters calls for NOMe-Seq positions (nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing) where accessible DNA gets methylated in a GpC context:\r\n\r\n     (i) filters CpGs to only output cytosines in A-CG and T-CG context\r\n    (ii) filters GC context to only report cytosines in GC-A, GC-C and GC-T context\r\n\r\nBoth of these measures aim to reduce unwanted biases, i.e. the influence of G-CG (intended) and C-CG (off-target) on endogenous CpG  methylation, and the influence of CpG methylation on (the NOMe-Seq specific) GC context methylation.\r\n\r\nThe NOMe-Seq filtering output reports cytosines in CpG context only if they are in A-CG or T-CG context,\r\nand cytosines in GC context only when the C is not in CpG context. The output file is tab-delimited and in\r\nthe following format (1-based coords):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<readID>  <chromosome>  <read start>  <read end>  <count methylated CpG>  <count non-methylated CpG>  <count methylated GC>  <count non-methylated GC>\r\nHWI-D00436:298:C9KY4ANXX:1:1101:2035:2000_1:N:0:_ACAGTGGT 10 8517979 8518098 0 1 0 1\r\nHWI-D00436:298:C9KY4ANXX:1:1101:5072:1993_1:N:0:_ACAGTGGT 8 9476630 9476748 0 0 0 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### coverage2cytosine\r\n- Fixed an [issue](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/89) in `--merge_CpG` mode caused by chromosomes ending in CG.\r\n\r\n- Fixed an [issue](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/98) caused by specifying `--zero` as well as `--merge_CpG`. \r\n\r\n### bam2nuc\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where the option `--output_dir` had been ignored.\r\n\r\n### filter_non_conversion\r\n\r\nRemoved help text indicating that this script also did the deduplication.\r\n",

Optionally, the non-CG count may be forced to occur on consecutive non-CGs using the option `--consecutive`.\n- Added time stamp to filtering step.\n\n## bismark2bedGraph\n- For the creation of temporary files, we are now replacing `/` characters in the chromosome names with `_` (underscores), similar to `|` (pipe) characters, as these `/` would attempt to write files to non-existing directories.\n\n## deduplicate_bismark\n- Single-/paired-end detection now also accepts --1 or --2.\n- Added EOF or truncation detection, causing the deduplicator to die.\n\n## bismark_methylation_extractor\n- Single-/paired-end detection now also accepts --1 or --2.\n- Added EOF or truncation detection, causing the methylation extractor to die.\n- Addded fatal ID1/ID2 check to paired-end extraction so that files which went out-of-sync at a later stage do not complete silently (but incorrectly!)\n\n## bismark2report\n- Major refactoring of `bismark2report`, the output should look the same though. Massive thanks to Phil Ewels for this.\n\n## coverage2cytosine\n- Added a new option `--NOMe-seq` to filter nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-Seq) data where accessible DNA gets enzymatically methylated in a GpC context. The option `--NOMe-seq`:\n\n```\n     i) filters the genome-wide CpG-report to only output cytosines in ACG and TCG context\n    ii) filters the GC context output to only report cytosines in GCA, GCC and GCT context\n```\n\nBoth of these measures aim to reduce unwanted biases, namely the influence of GCG and CCG on endogenous CpG methylation, and the inlfluence of CpG methylation on (the NOMe-Seq specific) GC context methylation. PLEASE NOTE that NOMe-Seq data requires a .cov.gz file as input which has been generated in non-CG mode (`--CX`).\n\n## bismark_genome_preparation\n- Fixed a bug that arose when `--genomic_composition` was specified (now moving back to the genome directory for _in silico_ conversion).\n",

Thanks to John Gaspar for spotting this!\n\n## deduplicate_bismark\n- Does now bail with a useful error message when the input files are empty.\n\n## bismark_genome_preparation\n- Added new option `--genomic_composition` so that the genomic composition can be calculated and written right at the genome preparation stage rather than by using `bam2nuc`\n\n## bam2nuc\n- Now also calculates a fold coverage for the various (di-)nucleotides. The changes in the nucleotide_stats text file are also picked up and plotted by `bismark2report`\n- Added a new option `--genomic_composition_only` to just process the genomic sequence without requiring any data files\n\n## bismark2summary\n- Added option `-o/--basename <filename>` to specify a certain filename. If not specified the name will\n  remain `bismark_summary_report.txt/html`\n- Added documentation and the options `--help` and `--version` to be consistent with the rest of Bismark\n- Added option `--title <string>` to give the HTML report a different title\n",

        "description": "#### Bismark\n\n---\n- File endings `.fastq | .fq | .fastq.gz | .fq.gz` are now removed from the output file (unless they were specified with `--basename`) in a bid to reduce the length of the already long file names.\n- Enabled the new option `--dovetail` (which will be turned on by default for `--pbat` libraries) which will now allow dovetailing reads to be reported. For a more in-depth description see https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/14.\n- Changed the behaviour of corner cases to where several non-directional alignments could have existed for the very same position but to different strands so that now the best alignment trumps the weaker one. As an example: If you relaxed the alignment criteria of a given alignment to allow ~60 mismatches for PE alignment we did find an alignment to the OT strand with a combined AS of -324, but there also was an alignment to the CTOB strand with and AS of 0 (perfect alignment). The CTOB now trumps the OT alignment, and the methylation information information is now reported for the bottom strand. Credits go to Sylvain Foret (ANU, Canberra) for bringing this to our attention!\n\n#### New module: bismark2summary\n\n---\n- `bismark2summary` accepts Bismark BAM files as input. It will then try to identify Bismark reports, and optionally deduplication reports or methylation extractor (splitting) reports automatically based the BAM file basename. It produces a tab delimited overview table (.txt) as well as a graphical HTML report. \n  Examples can be found at http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/bismark_summary_report.html and http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/bismark_summary_report.txt. Thanks to @ewels for help with the Java Script part!\n\n![Bismark summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/fef3c7239d111eaed11bbb5e649c4e791be34905/Docs/Images/summary.png)\n\n#### New module: bam2nuc\n\n---\n- The new Bismark module `bam2nuc` calculcates the average mono- and di-nucleotide coverage of libraries and compares this to the genomic average composition. `bam2nuc` can be called straight from within Bismark (option `--nucleotide_coverage`) or run stand-alone. `bam2nuc` creates a `...nucleotide_stats.txt` file that is also automatically detected by `bismark2report` and incorporated into the HTML report.\n  ![(di-)nucleotide coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/fef3c7239d111eaed11bbb5e649c4e791be34905/Docs/Images/nucleocoverage.png)\n\n#### bismark2_sitrep.tpl\n\n---\n- Removed an extra function call in `bismark_sitrep.tpl` so that the M-bias 2 plot is drawn once the M-bias 1 plot has finished drawing (parallel processing could with certain browsers and data may have resulted in a white spaceholder only).\n\n#### methylation extractor\n\n---\n- Altering the file path handling of `coverage2cytosine` and `bismark2bedGraph` also required some changes in the methylation extractor.\n\n#### bismark2bedGraph\n\n---\n- Input file path handling has been completely reworked. The output file which can be specified as `-o output.bedGraph` now has to be a single file name and mustn't contain any path information. A particular output folder may be specified with `-dir /any/path/`.\n- Addressing the file path handling issue also fixed a similar issue with the option `--remove_spaces` when `-o` had been specified.\n\n#### coverage2cytosine\n\n---\n- Changed `zcat` for `gunzip -c` when reading a gzipped coverage file. This should avoid some Mac platforms crashing because zcat invariably requires a file to end in the .Z (which it doesn't...)\n- Changed the way in which the coverage input file is handed over from the `methylation_extractor`\n  to `coverage2cytosine` (previously the path information might have been part of the file name, but\n  instead it will now be only part of the `-dir output_directory` option.\n",

The filenames may be provided as a comma `,` or colon `:`-separated\n  list.\n- Added option `--genome_folder <path/to/genome>` as alternative to supplying the genome as the\n  first argument.\n- Added an option `--rg_tag` to print an `@RG header line` as well as and `RG:Z:` tag to each read.\n  The ID and SAMPLE fields default to 'SAMPLE', but can be specified manually with `--rg_id` or\n  `--rg_sample`.\n- Added new option `--ambig_bam` for Bowtie2-mode only, which writes out a single alignment for\n  sequences with multiple alignments to a special file ending in `.ambiguous.bam`. The alignments\n  are in Bowtie2 format and do not any contain Bismark specific entries such as the methylation\n  call etc. These ambiguous BAM files are intended to be used as coverage estimators for variant\n  callers. Works for single-end and paired-end alignments in single or multi-core mode.\n- Added the new options `--cram` and `--cram_ref` to Bismark for both paired- and single-end alignments\n  in single or multi-core mode. This option requires Samtools version 1.2 or higher. A genome\n  FastA reference may be supplied as a single file with the option `--cram_ref`; if this is not\n  specified the file is derived from the reference FastA file(s) used for the Bismark run, and written\n  to the file `Bismark_genome_CRAM_reference.mfa` into the output directory.\n\n#### deduplicate_bismark\n\n---\n- Added better handling of cases when the input file was empty (died for percentage calculation\n  instead of calling it N/A)\n- Added a note mentioning that Read1 and Read2 of paired-end files are expected to follow each\n  other in two consecutive lines and possibly require name-sorting prior to deduplication. Also\n  added a check that reads the first 100000 lines to see if the file appears to have been sorted\n  and bail out if this is true.\n\n#### methylation extractor\n\n---\n- Added support for `CRAM` files (this option requires Samtools version 1.2 or higher)\n\n#### bismark2bedGraph\n\n---\n- Changed the way `gzip` compressed input files are handled when using the `UNIX sort` command (i.e. with\n  `--scaffolds/--gazillion` or without `--ample_memory`\n\n#### coverage2cytosine\n\n---\n- Added option `--gzip` to compress output files. This currently only works for the default CpG_report\n  and CX_report output files (and thus not with the option `--gc` or `--split_files`. The option `--gzip`\n  is now also passed on from the `bismark_methylation_extractor`.\n- Added a check to bail if no information was found in the coverage file, e.g. if a wrong file path for a .cov.gz file had been specified\n\n#### bismark_genome_preparation\n\n---\n- Added process handling to the child processes.\n",
