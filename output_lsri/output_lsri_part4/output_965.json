While this breaks compatibility with old versions, we think the improvements\nare worth it. Parsing and QC are no longer separate operations, but can be performed at the same time. As such, there are no longer \"parse\"\nand \"qc\" modes to invoke. We have made efforts to preserve most of the original arguments as they were, so there shouldn't be too much to\nupdate if you use RawTools as part of a script. For help with this new interface, see `>RawTools.exe -commands`.\n- We have now integrated data visualization into the tool itself (see examples below). The new RawToolsViz.exe allows for visualization of QC and parse data\nand RawTools-generated chromatograms, and exploration of Thermo .raw files themselves. While the .raw file exploration has only been\nextensively tested in Windows, it should be compatible with Linux and Mac systems as well.\n- Some metrics have been renamed to align the naming schemes used in the various data files (parse, qc, metrics). Because of this, the \nR Shiny app may not work anymore. The Shiny app will no longer be updated and will be taken offline in the near future, as visualization can now be carried out locally with RawToolsViz.\n- New metrics have been added to QC output, including the number of cycles across the average peak profile, median peptide hyperscore\nand cutoff hyperscore used for FDR.\n- IdentiPy is no longer supported as a search engine. While we don't have any issues with IdentiPy, we felt it was easiest to maintain\nsupport for only a single search engine. As X! Tandem does not have any external dependencies (i.e. Python), we felt it was the best choice for this particular case.\n- We will be working to update the wiki over the next week to reflect changes in v2.0.0.\n \n"

        "description": "### Attention [2019-07-04]\r\n\r\n- Do not download v2.0.0. It contains a bug which prevents RawToolsViz from opening data files. [Please get v2.0.1 instead](https://github.com/kevinkovalchik/RawTools/releases/tag/2.0.1).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- A lot has changed since v1.4.2!\r\n- The command line interface has been updated and streamlined. While this breaks compatibility with old versions, we think the improvements are worth it. Parsing and QC are no longer separate operations, but can be performed at the same time. As such, there are no longer \"parse\" and \"qc\" modes to invoke. We have made efforts to preserve most of the original arguments as they were, so there shouldn't be too much to update if you use RawTools as part of a script. For help with this new interface, see `RawTools -commands`.\r\n- We have now integrated data visualization into the tool itself. The new `RawToolsViz.exe` allows for visualization of QC and parse data and RawTools-generated chromatograms, and exploration of Thermo .raw files themselves. While the .raw file exploration has only been extensively tested in Windows, it should be compatible with Linux and Mac systems as well.\r\n- Some metrics have been renamed to align the naming schemes used in the various data files (parse, qc, metrics). Because of this, the Shiny app may not work anymore. It is unlikely the app will be updated as visualization can now be carried out locally.\r\n- New metrics have been added to QC output, including the number of cycles across the average peak profile, median peptide hyperscore and cutoff hyperscore used for FDR.",

        "description": "### Changes\r\n- We have changed the internal settings of RawTools so output data files always use decimal dots rather than decimal commas (e.g. 1.234 vs 1,234). Previously decimal commas were sometimes the default depending on the system language. This decision was made because some database search engines are not able to properly parse MGF files with decimal commas. If this impacts your downstream workflow in a negative way, please let us know and we will try to make this change user-specified rather than a default.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- There was a bug that resulted in crashes during quantification. This was introduced with the reporter mass error reporting. It has been fixed.\r\n- MGF files in v1.4 were found to be incompatible with MS-GF+. This has been fixed.",

        "description": "## RawToolsGUI is here!\r\n\r\nThis new beta release adds a graphical user interface to RawTools. It runs on top of a modified version of RawTools 1.4.1, and provides a user-friendly interface to set up all your parse and search parameters. RawToolsGUI then formats the proper command line arguments and runs a new instance of RawTools for you using those arguments. You can save and load the parameters as well, so once you have a standard routine set up, you won't need to click so many buttons every time you want to run it.\r\n\r\nThe release includes regular RawTools as well, so there is no need to copy any files around. Once we are ready to move past the beta stage, RawToolsGUI will simply be incorporated into the regular RawTools distribution. You will be able to run RawTools with the CLI using `RawTools.exe` and as a GUI using `RawToolsGUI.exe`, but both files will be distributed in all releases.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**\r\nRawToolsGUI, like RawTools, requires the .NET or Mono Framework. This means if you are running from Linux or Mac you will still need to run it from a console like this: `$ mono RawToolsGUI.exe`. At some point we plan to include a simple console script that will do this for you when you click on it.",

        "description": "***NOTE: This is a beta release. If you want the latest stable release look for v1.3.3. However, if you are looking for the newest features and fixes before they come out in the official release, then the beta is what you want. Be aware that new .zip files will appear under the `Assets` section as we add features and work out kinks. So to get the most recent version, look for the file with the largest number after \"beta\" in the title.***\r\n\r\nThis release makes some significant changes to the processing workflow intended to improve performance, especially for large files (as in issue #6). This is a beta release. Feel free to try it out, but know there might be some bugs. If you find any, please let us know!\r\n\r\nAlso addressed in this release is issue #11. In that issue we note the number of scans reported is not always correct. This should be fixed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE: When originally released, the .zip file available for download was actually a .tar file with the wrong extension. This has been fixed. [2018-12-04]**\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.3.zip` Relative paths are now supported for all arguments.\r\n- `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.2.zip` Precursor peaks are now extracted based on picked m/z rather than monoisotopic m/z.\r\n- This release adds a new \"logdump\" function, which outputs the raw file instrument log to a text file. Use it like this:\r\n`RawTools logdump -f [path to raw file]`\r\n`RawTools logdump -d [directory in which to get log files from all raw files]`\r\nPretty much everything about how the instrument was operating is in there, scan by scan, from capillary temperature to lens voltages to turbopump lifetimes, etc.\r\n\r\n## Bugs found (in the beta) and fixed\r\n\r\n- A column offset was introduced in MS3 Matrix files. This is fixed in `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.5.zip` [2019-01-03]\r\n- MGF files were not compatible with MS Amanda. This is fixed in `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.5.zip` [2019-01-03]\r\n- _Matrix files were not being generated when -q was used. This is fixed in `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.4.zip` [2018-12-20]\r\n- Use of relative paths in QC arguments was resulting in duplicate nested folders for the QC output. This has been fixed in `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.3.zip` [2018-12-11]\r\n- `-N` was being ignored during writing of MGF files for QC, resulting in all spectra being searched. This has been fixed in `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.3.zip`. [2018-12-11]\r\n- `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.zip` has a bug where it crashes when it encounters an empty centroid stream. This has been fixed in `RawTools-1.4.0-beta.1.zip` [2018-12-05]\r\n- Output matrix from parse ended in _parse.txt rather than _Matrix.txt. This has been fixed in `RawTools-1.4.0.beta.2.zip` [2018-12-07]",
