The DENOPTIM repository includes <code>.project</code> and <code>.classpath</code>. So you can easily import the entire DENOPTIM project into Eclipse.\n\n## Git work-flow \nNice guidelines can be found in the Internet. For instance, see (https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/). Here is a summary of how to go with making changes to the source using the functionality provided by Git:\n\n1. Fork the `master` branch. The easiest is to use the `Fork` button on the top right to make your own copy. This will eventually open the GitHub page of our copy of `master` in your browser. \n\n2. Get a local copy. Use the `Clone or download` button to get the URL and use it in this command:\n\n    cd <somewhere>\n    git clone <URL>\n\n3. Add the original repo as an upstream to grab changes made by others to the original branch while you work on your branch.\n\n    cd DENOPTIM\n    git remote add upstream https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM.git\n\n4. Get the local copy of the software working fine before you make any change. Compile all your branch and run all tests. Make sure it's all working. If not, identify and possibly solve the problem or ask for help. Do not proceed unless it's all working fine.\n\n5. Make a branch for the changes you want to introduce:\n\n    git checkout master\n    git pull upstream master\n    git push origin master\n    git checkout -b <name_of_branch>\n    \n6. Now you can do what you want to contribute. If you add new functionality or just new keywords, please add proper documentation and tests with data that can be distributed under the DENOPTIM license (no proprietary material). Commit to your branch with [proper commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n\n7. Unless you are introducing major changes that are incompatible with previous version, you must incorporate changes made by others to the original `master`, and resolve potential conflicts:\n\n    git pull upstream master \n    git push origin master\n    \n8. When you are done, run all tests and make sure your changes are being tested. If not, create new tests.\n\n9. Create a pull request to your copy of `master`\n\n    git push -u origin <name_of_branch>\n\n10. In the web page of the browser you'll find a `Compare & pull request` button that will allow you to compare the changes you have made and request the inclusion of those changes in the original `master` branch.\n"

In practice, DENOPTIM builds chemical entities by assembling building blocks (i.e., fragments), analyzes each chemical entity as to produce its figure of merit (i.e., fitness), and designs new entities based on the properties of known entities.\n\nDENOPTIM is cross-platform, i.e., runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and comes with a graphical user interface, i.e., the GUI. However, computationally demanding molecular design jobs, which we call <i>DENOPTIM experiments</i>, are typically run in the background, as batch processes. Yet, the GUI allows to create input files for such DENOPTIM experiments (Figure 1a), in addition to visualize and edit molecular fragments (Figure 1b) and other DENOPTIM's data structures, and, finally, inspect the output produced by DENOPTIM experiments (Figure 1c).\n\n![Figure 1](./doc/figures/gui_snapshots.png)\n"

Such environment, which we call `dnp_devel`, can be created by manual installation of both JAVA and Maven, or it can be created using conda:\n```\ncd $DENOPTIM_HOME\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate dnp_devel\n```\n\nVerify the requirements by running the two commands: Both should return a message declaring the respective versions.\n```\njavac -version\nmvn -version\n```\n\nNow, you can build DENOPTIM with\n```\nmvn package\n```\n\nOnce maven has finished, you can call DENOPTIM using a command like the following (NB: replace `$DENOPTIM_HOME` and `${VERSION}` as with the values that apply to your installation):\nOn Linux/Mac terminals and Windows GitBash:\n```\njava -jar $DENOPTIM_HOME/target/denoptim-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n```\nInstead, on Windows Anaconda prompt:\n```\njava -jar $DENOPTIM_HOME\\target\\denoptim-${VERSION}-jar-with-dependencies.jar\n```\nIn the rest of this document, we well use `denoptim` to refer to the above command.

Use the [format conversion script](https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM/blob/d465081bfb8c9d7c268bb0f876517eb0cb575f17/src/misc/JSONConverter/convert_symmetric_sets_in_JSON.py)to convert JSON and .sdf files generated by version<4 to the new format.\r\n- It is now possible to control the maximum size of the subgraphs that the crossover operation can swap.

To run this example:\n```\ncd $DENOPTIM_HOME/test/PtCOLX2\nbash runEvolutionaryExperiment.sh\n```\n* [test/PtCOLX2_FSE](./test/PtCOLX2_FSE): virtual screening of organometallic ligands sets that weaken the carbonyl bond in Pt(CO)(L)(X)<sub>2</sub> complexes (less then 5 minutes on a regular laptop). To run this example:\n```\ncd $DENOPTIM_HOME/test/PtCOLX2_FSE\nbash runCombinatorialExperiment.sh\n```\n\nThe GUI can be used to inspect the results. To this end, copy the pathname that is printed by DENOPTIM in the terminal after `Output files associated with the current run are located in $path_to_your_output` and use the GUI to open it:\n```\ndenoptim $path_to_your_output\n```\n"
