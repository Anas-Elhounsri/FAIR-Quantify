Users can also sample documents using different strategies to obtain a more manageable dataset for further analysis. Adjutant makes explicit trade-offs between speed and accuracy, which are modifiable by the user, such that a complete analysis of several thousand documents can take a few minutes. All analytic datasets generated by Adjutant are saved, allowing users to easily conduct other downstream analyses that Adjutant does not explicitly support. \n"

        "value": "It is also possible to use Adjutant within your own code, bypassing the Shiny application all together.\n\n**Step 0: Load Adjutant**\n\nTo run this demo the first thing you need to do is load Adjutant (once you've downloaded it), and some additional packages for analysis.\n\n```R\nlibrary(adjutant)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidytext) #for stop words\n\n#also set a seed - there is some randomness in the analysis.\nset.seed(416)\n```\n\n**Step 1: Downloading data from PubMed to your computer**\n\n**processSearch** is Adjutant's PubMed search function and is effectively a wrapper for [RISmed](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RISmed/RISmed.pdf) that formats RISmed's output into a clean data frame, with additional PubMed metadata (PubMed central citation count, language, article type etc). You can pass RISmed's EUtilsSummary parameters to the Adjutant's **processSearch** function.\n\nPlease note that Adjutant's downstream methods *expect* a dataframe with the column names that are produced by the **processSearch** method.\n\n*Depending upon the size of the query, it can take a few minutes to download all of the data.*\n\n```R\ndf<-processSearch(\"(outbreak OR epidemic OR pandemic) AND genom*\",retmax=2000)\n```\n\nIf you have an NCBI API key, you should include it within processSearch. See the 'NCBI API Key' section of this readme for more details. You can also choose not retrieve missing abstracts (which happens infrequently), which also speeds up the search process.\n\n```R\nncbi_key<-\"A_key_I_made_up\"\n\n#ncbi_key is a parameter that takes your ncbi_api key value\n#forceGet is a parameter that indicates if you should try retrieve missing abstracts (default:TRUE) or not (FALSE).\n\ndf<-processSearch(\"(outbreak OR epidemic OR pandemic) AND genom*\",ncbi_key = ncbi_key, forceGet=FALSE,retmax=2000)\n\n```\n**Step 2: Generating a tidy text corpus**\n\nAdjutant next constructs a per-article [\"bag-of-words\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) arranged in a [tidy text format](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html). This step is necessary for further analysis in Adjutant, but can also be an interesting data set for other kinds of analysis not supported by Adjutant.\n\n```R\ntidy_df<-tidyCorpus(corpus = df)\n```\n**Step 3: Performing a dimensionality reduction using t-SNE**\n\nTo learn more about t-SNE, please consult this [excellent article in Distill Pub](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/). Generally, Adjutant's topic clustering works best when there are a large number of diverse articles. It is still possible to get reasonable results with a smaller number of articles (fewer than 1,000 for example), and with a very homogenous dataset (for example just recent zika virus articles), but more general searches with large number of documents work best.\n\n```R\ntsneObj<-runTSNE(tidy_df,check_duplicates=FALSE)\n\n#add t-SNE co-ordinates to df object\ndf<-inner_join(df,tsneObj$Y,by=\"PMID\")\n\n# plot the t-SNE results\nggplot(df,aes(x=tsneComp1,y=tsneComp2))+\n  geom_point(alpha=0.2)+\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\nBelow is an initial plot of our documents! Each point is one article, darker points means many overlapping articles, and you'll notice that some articles already form visible groups (clusters), in the next step we'll suss out which clusters are reasonably well defined (according to the algorithm).\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5395870/36921077-d84ac778-1e17-11e8-8e57-a1d8f0c19808.png)\n\n**Step 4: Perform an unsupervised clustering using hdbscan**\n\nIf you use hdbscan through Adjutant, the result will be the Adjuntant optimized hdbscan minPts parameter. You can also just use hdbscan directly on the result t-SNE dimensionally reduced data and sort out what the best hbdscan minPts parameter is for yourself. \n\n```R\n#run HDBSCAN and select the optimal cluster parameters automaticallu\noptClusters <- optimalParam(df)\n\n#add the new cluster ID's the running dataset\ndf<-inner_join(df,optClusters$retItems,by=\"PMID\") %>%\n    mutate(tsneClusterStatus = ifelse(tsneCluster == 0, \"not-clustered\",\"clustered\"))\n\n# plot the HDBSCAN clusters (no names yet)\nclusterNames <- df %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(tsneCluster) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(medX = median(tsneComp1),\n                   medY = median(tsneComp2)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(tsneCluster != 0)\n\nggplot(df,aes(x=tsneComp1,y=tsneComp2,group=tsneCluster))+\n  geom_point(aes(colour = tsneClusterStatus),alpha=0.2)+\n  geom_label(data=clusterNames,aes(x=medX,y=medY,label=tsneCluster),size=2,colour=\"red\")+\n  stat_ellipse(aes(alpha=tsneClusterStatus))+\n  scale_colour_manual(values=c(\"black\",\"blue\"),name=\"cluster status\")+\n  scale_alpha_manual(values=c(1,0),name=\"cluster status\")+ #remove the cluster for noise\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\nBelow is the same plot as before, but now we've got some clusters that Adjutant thinks are reasonable.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5395870/36921074-d6be519a-1e17-11e8-98d5-a8b63e87623c.png)\n\n**Step 5: Naming the clusters**\n\nAdjutant has a function called **getTopTerms** that will automatically name a cluster according to its the top two most commonly occuring terms. If there are ties, it will return all.\n\n```R\nclustNames<-df %>%\n          group_by(tsneCluster)%>%\n          mutate(tsneClusterNames = getTopTerms(clustPMID = PMID,clustValue=tsneCluster,topNVal = 2,tidyCorpus=tidy_df)) %>%\n          select(PMID,tsneClusterNames) %>%\n          ungroup()\n        \n#update document corpus with cluster names\ndf<-inner_join(df,clustNames,by=c(\"PMID\",\"tsneCluster\"))\n\n#re-plot the clusters\n\nclusterNames <- df %>%\n  dplyr::group_by(tsneClusterNames) %>%\n  dplyr::summarise(medX = median(tsneComp1),\n                   medY = median(tsneComp2)) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(tsneClusterNames != \"Not-Clustered\")\n\nggplot(df,aes(x=tsneComp1,y=tsneComp2,group=tsneClusterNames))+\n  geom_point(aes(colour = tsneClusterStatus),alpha=0.2)+\n  stat_ellipse(aes(alpha=tsneClusterStatus))+\n  geom_label(data=clusterNames,aes(x=medX,y=medY,label=tsneClusterNames),size=3,colour=\"red\")+\n  scale_colour_manual(values=c(\"black\",\"blue\"),name=\"cluster status\")+\n  scale_alpha_manual(values=c(1,0),name=\"cluster status\")+ #remove the cluster for noise\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\nFinally, here's the same plot again, but now with the names of the clusters. You'll notice that some clusters have very specific names (zika-viru; ebola viru) and some have more generic names (sequenc-isol-outbreak). My hypothesis for what is happening is a classic signal issue - some pathogens with only a few articles seem to cluster together into these more generic clusters, whereas pathogens with a lot of publications (and hence strong signal in the data) tend to form their own clusters.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5395870/36920256-fe85e1d2-1e14-11e8-9c84-6bb7c8b13662.png)\n\n**Step 6: Go forth and analyze some more!**\n\nYou can use df, tidy_df, or any other object produced by Adjutant in your own analysis!\n"
