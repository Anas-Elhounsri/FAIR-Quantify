Be sure to search the list to see if your issue has already been raised.\n\nA good bug report is one that make it easy for us to understand what you were trying to do and what went wrong. Also, provide as much context as possible so we can try to recreate the issue.\n\n#New features\n\nPlease raise any new feature requests on the project's issue tracker.\n\n#Pull requests\n\n##Changes to existing code\n\nIf you want to raise a pull request with a new feature, or a refactoring of existing code, make sure to open an issue in the project's issue tracker first before engaging in serious development work. This will start a discussion and help in accepting the pull request.\n\n##Coding standards\n\nPlease ensure you follow the coding standards used throughout the existing code base. Some basic rules include:\n\n- All files must have the Apache license in the header.\n- Indent \n- Document all part of your code\n\n##Contributor License Agreement\n\nIn order for us to accept pull requests, the contributor must first complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This clarifies the intellectual property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of IBM and its customers; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.\n\nYou can download the CLAs here:\n\n- [individual] (https://github.com/ComputationalGenomics/SimRA/blob/master/Contributing/cla-individual.pdf)\n- [corporate] (https://github.com/ComputationalGenomics/SimRA/blob/master/Contributing/cla-corporate.pdf)\n\nIf you are an *IBMer*, please contact us directly as the contribution process is slightly different.\n"
