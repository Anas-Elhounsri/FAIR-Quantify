        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "[Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) algorithms are used in many scientific and industrial settings to assign individuals (or \"instances\" or \"samples\") to specific categories. A classic example is classifying [iris flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to their correct species based on visually observable features (\"variables\"): petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. Rather than examine these features individually, classification algorithms seek to identify multivariate patterns that discriminate the categories. Classification has been applied in various contexts, including computational biology, speech recognition, computer vision, spam filtering, credit scoring, etc. See more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification#Application_domains). \nTypically, a classification algorithm is applied to a dataset that contains many instances of each category, and the algorithm identifies patterns that differ among the groups. To evaluate the algorithm's ability to distinguish among individuals in the groups, the algorithm is applied to new data instances. If the algorithm accurately predicts the category to which these new instances belong, the algorithm may be suitable for broader application. Different research applications require different levels of accuracy before these algorithms are suitable for broader application. However, in many cases, even small improvements in accuracy can provide large benefits. Accordingly, researchers seek to identify ways to optimize prediction accuracy. \nHundreds of classification algorithms have been developed. Each algorithm has different properties, which may make it more or less suitable for particular applications. However, due to the large number of available algorithms, it is difficult to know which algorithms should be applied in specific settings. In addition, most algorithms support \"hyperparameters\" (or settings), which the user can configure and which may affect accuracy dramatically. Thus it is also difficult to know which hyperparameters should be used in a given setting. \nOne way to address this problem is to perform benchmark comparisons across multiple algorithms and hyperparameters and to identify what works best in particular settings. In this way, algorithm(s) and hyperparameters can be selected in an evidence-based manner. (Care must be taken to avoid biases when performing such benchmarks; see [Word of Caution](https://github.com/srp33/ShinyLearner/blob/master/Word_of_Caution.md).) \nThe open-source community have developed many machine-learning software libraries that implement classification algorithms. However, several barriers make it difficult to perform large-scale benchmark comparisons across algorithms. For one, each software library supports only a subset of available classification algorithms; thus to perform a comprehensive comparison, it is useful to compare algorithms that have been implemented in multiple software libraries. Secondly, although most machine-learning libraries allow users to execute analyses programmatically\u2014thus supporting reproducibility and enabling greater flexibility\u2014different machine-learning libraries are implemented in different programming languages and often require esoteric input-data formats. In addition, output formats are not standardized, thus requiring custom efforts to parse and integrate the results. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure that benchmark evaluations are performed across algorithms in a consistent and robust manner, yet different machine-learning libraries use different techniques for evaluating algorithm performance. Finally, to install third-party machine-learning libraries, researchers must install specific software dependencies, and these requirements usually differ by software version and operating system. \nWe developed *ShinyLearner* to address these challenges. ShinyLearner acts as a software \"wrapper\" for existing machine-learning libraries, including [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable), [weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka), [mlr](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/release/html), and [keras/tensorflow](https://keras.io). Each of these libraries was written in a different programming language (Python, Java, or R). Scientists who use these tools interface with them in ways that are specific to each library. For example, to use *scikit-learn* or *mlr*, users need to write code in the particular programming languages supported by these tools. Although *weka* provides a graphical user interface (in addition to a programming interface), users may find it difficult to extract and analyze predictions provided by this tool or to execute analyses at scale. A wide variety of classification algorithms are supported by these tools, and there is some overlap across these libraries; however, many algorithms are implemented in only one of these packages. Therefore, to gain access to all the algorithms that a researcher may wish to use, he/she may need to work with multiple libraries. Additionally, if a scientist wanted to compare algorithms implemented in multiple libraries, considerable effort would be required. ShinyLearner makes this easy!\n \n"

However, these commands can become a bit long and complex. Thus we have created a Web application that enables users to construct ShinyLearner commands more easily (see [https://bioapps.byu.edu/shinylearner](https://bioapps.byu.edu/shinylearner)). The user specifies input-data files, algorithms, hyperparameters, and a validation strategy. ShinyLearner takes care of the rest.\n"
