Pickled rules.\n- change config: change the config file from command line.\n- Chemical Compound state: contains a wrapper around the compound class. It selects the best available moves of a state, checks terminality etc. The basic MCTS object. It also creates the organisms which are states.\n- Chemical scoring: utilities for chemical scoring.\n- Chemistry choices: documents important chemistry choices made during the project.\n- Compound: wrapper around rdkit mol. Basic object containing all transformations, sorting of rules. That is where the chemistry happens. Currently contains archive functions for parallelisation that will be simplified one day.\n- compound scoring: at the moment, contains scoring for toxicity bias.\n- Config: Allows for configuration of MCTS parameters used throughout the tree running. Also generates the logs for this.\n- convert to SBML: converts a JSON file for a pathway to an SBML file.\n- data: contains the data necessary to run RetroPath3.0\n- expected_results: cotnains expected results from running the first example udner Testing section.\n- MCTS_node: has a state as attribute, but also keeps information of father, son, number of visits, rollout results and so on. This is where most algorithmic improvements are encoded.\n- Move: contains the move - ie: mostly a wrapper around a chemical rule, with pointing compound and products, as well as scores and RAVE results.\n_ organisms: wrapper around organisms used as sinks for the retrosynthetic search.\n- pathway: can store pathways, with utils to add compounds and reactions and export as a json. Is also be compatible with scorers.\n- pathway_scoring: used to score pathways.\n- representation: a class defining how to represent nodes, states and compounds (text vs colors in the Terminal).\n- rewarding: a class containing rewards after a rollout.\n- Rollout_policies: contains different ways to sample the rollout (random, proportional to the chemical score, the biological score, combination thereof etc)\n- rule_set_sexamples: imports rule from csv files. Used for basic examples, does not allows for similarity scoring.\n- rule_sets_similarity: imports rules under a similarity compatible format.\n- setup: for compatibility with pip.\n- supplement_finder: allows finding of supplements in Trees.\n- tests: contains tests for installation.\n- Tree: performs the tree search: mostly iterating through the MCTS node objects a defined number of times. Utilities for pathways, saving etc. This is the script to use to run the MCTS search.\n- tree_viewer: save tree under a viewer compatible format.\n- UCT_policies: contains different ways to select the best child (classical, proportional to the chemical score, the biological score, combination thereof etc)\n- utilities: contains utilities to apply reaction rules and standardise compounds.\n"

This allows easy parsing of the fact that 4 results were generated when running the search.\n- json files called deoxiviolacein_N.json, with N from 1 to 4: files containing pathways under json format. There is no ordering of those files.\n- deoxiviolacein_best.json: contains the best pathway (ie: with the most visits)\n- deoxiviolacein_full_scope.json: contains all pathways in the same json file.\n- deoxiviolacein_full_tree_for_MCTS.json: contains the Tree under json format. This allows visualisation node by node using our tree viewer available at [https://github.com/brsynth/scope-viewer](https://github.com/brsynth/scope-viewer).\n- deoxiviolacein_iteration_N.json: contains the pathway found at iteration N. Folder should contain 4 such files.\n- pickles is a folder containing tree_end_search.pkl: the full pickled tree. This can be used for tree extension or analysis.\n- results.csv contains the configuration and the results from this configuration (STOP_REASON should be iteration here)\n- tree.log contains execution logs.\nExcept for the json files containing the word 'tree', all json files can be visualised using our scope viewer available at [https://github.com/brsynth/scope-viewer](https://github.com/brsynth/scope-viewer).\n\n"
