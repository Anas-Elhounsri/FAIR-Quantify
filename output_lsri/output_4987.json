VarSight relies on [Codicem](http://envisiongenomics.com/codicem-analysis-platform/) to perform common clinical pipeline pre-processing, namely variant annotation and filtering.  In addition to data available in Codicem, it also uses gene rankings that are based on Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms using both a built in calculation (cosine score) and the external tool [PyxisMap](https://github.com/HudsonAlpha/LayeredGraph).  The classifiers in VarSight ingest a total of 95 features that are run through a feature selection process to get the top 20 features.  Those 20 features are used to test both classification of reported variants and prioritization of reported variants in a larger filtered list.  Results from the latest version of VarSight tests are available in the folder labeled \"paper\".\n \n"
