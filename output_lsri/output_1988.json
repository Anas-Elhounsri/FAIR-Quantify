Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data import. FlowGateNIST starts by converting data from the FCS format to a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation in Python. \n2. Automated cell gating. FlowGateNIST uses a GMM approach and a comparison between measured cell samples and buffer blank samples for automated gating to discriminate between events that are most likely to be cells vs. events that are most likely to be background. \n3. Automated singlet gating. FlowGateNIST then uses comparisons between the height, area, and width parameters of flow cytometry events to automatically discriminate between singlet and multiplet events. \n4. Calibration of signals with fluorescent beads. In addition to automated gating, FlowGateNIST uses a multi-dimensional GMM applied to data for fluorescence calibration beads to convert measured fluorescence signals to comparable units. \n \n"
