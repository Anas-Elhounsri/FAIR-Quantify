If you want to further run the unit tests, relevant paths \nwill need to be specified in your 'config.json' file, e.g, if testing reinforcement learning, the corresponding unit tests \nwill require a prior: specify the path to the prior in the \"PRIOR_PATH\" field. \nImportant: Make sure that you set `MAIN_TEST_PATH` to a non-existent directory; it is where temporary files will be\nwritten during the tests; if it is set to an existing directory, that directory will be removed once the tests have finished. \nSome tests require a proprietary OpenEye license; you have to set up a few things to make the tests read your\nlicense.  The simple way is to just set the `OE_LICENSE` environment variable to the path of the file containing the\nlicense.  If you just want to set the license in the `reinvent_scoring` Conda environment, it is a bit more complicated,\nbut you only have to do it once.\n```\n(reinvent-scoring) $ cd $CONDA_PREFIX\n$ mkdir -p etc/conda/activate.d\n$ mkdir -p etc/conda/deactivate.d\n```\nPut the following in `etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh`.\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nexport OE_LICENSE='</path/to/your/oe_license/file>'\n```\nAnd put the following in `etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh`.\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nunset OE_LICENSE\n```\nOnce you have created the files, deactivate and re-activate the environment, and `echo $OE_LICENSE` should output the\npath to the license file.\nOnce you have a configuration and your license can be read, you can run the tests.\n```\n$ python main_test.py\n```\n \n"
