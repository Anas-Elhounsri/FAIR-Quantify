These lines cannot be coloured in a similar matter in Cytoscape either, and are hence excluded from FunHoP. \n\n\n**Hsa list:** This is a simple copy-paste of the KEGG database of hsa IDs and the belonging gene names. This list can be found here: http://rest.kegg.jp/list/hsa\n\n\n**Expression table:** Contains the gene names, gene IDs, and the value for each of the probes. Used here to extract the gene names (column 0).\n\n\n**Metadata:** Contains all the available metadata for the samples. The required data from this file is wether or not a sample is from cancer or control tissue. In the test files, this is found in column 6. \n\n\n**Expression Counts:** A matrix containing all the read counts for all the samples. Note that this should have the same number of genes as the gene names found in the expression table. The number of samples should be the same as the number of tissue statuses. \n\n\n**Updated gene symbols:** To update the list of genes to (hopefully) find more of the genes in the KEGG pathways. \n\n"
