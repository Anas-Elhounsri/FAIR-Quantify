The pipeline can handle pooled Hi-C sequencing libraries, and use them in combination with multiple metagenomics libraries."

Downloaded software are not accessible anywhere in your filesystem (except if you put them in your PATH), but the HAM-ART dependency configuration file can deal with the problem (see below).

Please make sure you have plenty of space allocated to the mountpoint the folder in (at least hundreds of GB, but for multiple projects several TB will be needed). All data related to your Hi-C metagenomics projects (from raw data to results) will be stored in the subfolders of this _pipeline root folder_.\n1. Create the following sub-folders in your _pipeline root folder_: ```raw_seq_data```, ```pre_assembly```, ```assembly```, ```post_assembly```, ```results```, ```project_defs```, ```host_ref_seqs```\n1. Download the HAM-ART repository and copy the following files to your _pipeline root folder_: ```ham_art.pl```, ```deps.txt```, ```ham_art_prj_template.txt```\n1. Make sure the ```ham_art.pl``` script is executable, if not you can change it by using the command line command ```chmod u+x ham_art.pl```\n1. Edit the ```deps.txt``` file, to set up the dependencies. Lines starting with ```#``` are comments only, read them to understand the syntax. For each software dependencies, you need to set up the path to the executable/folder.\n   1. __This file has to be edited only once, if you are not familiar with Linux filesystem and command line environment, you may ask someone with more experience for help.__\n   1. Don't change the first field in the line, those are the internal identifiers for the software dependencies\n   1. The second fields are defining the amount of CPU core and/or memory to be used when running the executable. Please read the comment lines to get the information. The amount set in this file are the optimal CPU core / memory amounts, usually only a little performace increase can be achieved by increasing them (except the metaspades.py, if you have more than 32, increase it). If you have less CPU cores in your Linux server, decrease the amount to that value where needed\n   1. If the executable path is in your PATH variable (you can execute them by only calling the application name even from the pipeline root folder), you don't need to edit the 3rd field in the line\n   1. If the executable path is not in your PATH variable, or you want to use a specific version for the pipeline (e.g. if you download a new version for SPAdes), you can include the full application path in the 3rd field of the line. Simply replace the application name with its full path (e.g. ```metaspades.py``` -> ```/home/user/SPAdes-3.13.0-Linux/bin/metaspades.py```)\n   1. Please be aware that in a few cases the line defines a path to a folder, not to the executable, please read the comment lines carefully!\n1. If you move the ```ham_art.pl``` main script file to a different location, always make sure, that you move it together with the ```deps.txt``` file, these two files has to be in the same directory.\n1. Download and index host genome(s). The HAM-ART pipeline cleans up the metagenomics sequencing data by removing those reads that are aligning to the host genome (e.g. if you are working with a human faecal sample, the potentially sequenced gut epithelial cell DNA). Make sure that you have the host organism whole genome sequence downloaded, and put the indexed (bowtie2 indexed) files in the ```host_ref_seqs/``` folder. For easier use, use simple prefix for the indexed files, you will need to use that prefix later in the project definition file (for an example workflow, see the example project below). "

The unique project identifier is used during the analysis steps, and in the combination of multiple samples during the clade-refinement. To set up a new project, you need the following steps (for an example setup, see the example workflow below):\n1. Copy the ```ham_art_prj_template.txt``` to a new filename within the ```project_defs/``` folder (ideally by naming it with the unique identifier)\n1. Edit the new file and define the project identifier, the raw data file names, the project folder and the host organism prefix in the appropriate lines\n1. After saving the new file, initiate the project by being in the ```project_defs/``` folder and executing the command ```../ham_art.pl initialise <project_definition_filename>``` (where you replace the spaceholder with your filename)."

Run this step by:\n```\n./ham_art.pl assembly <project_ID(s)>\n```\n* __Post-assembly.__ Re-align Hi-C reads, extract inter-contig contacts, build up the contact network, find communities in the network, split potentially mixed communities of contigs (based on contig coverage), perform basic MAG extension and create final MAGs.
