These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [aidenlab@bcm.edu](mailto:aidenlab@bcm.edu).\n\n## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!\n\n> **Note:** Please don't file an issue to ask a question. You'll get faster results by using our [3D-Genomics Official Forum](https://aidenlab.org/forum.html). We have an official message board where the community chimes in with helpful advice if you have questions.\n\nWhile we strongly suggest using the public forum so that the community at large benefits from the discussion, you can also send us an email at [aidenlab@bcm.edu](mailto:aidenlab@bcm.edu) for questions related to sensitive datasets.\n\n## **Did you find a bug?**\n\n* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/issues).\n\n* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample, executable test case, or clear set of instructions** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\n## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**\n\n* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.\n\n* Ensure the Pull Request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.\n\n## **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**\n\nChanges that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything to the stability, functionality, or testability of Juicer are still welcome!\n\n## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**\n\n* Suggest your change by creating a Github issue! Reach out to us at [aidenlab@bcm.edu](mailto:aidenlab@bcm.edu) for advice and start writing code!\n\n## **Do you have questions about the source code?**\n\n* Ask any question about how to use Juicer in the [3D Genomics Official Forum](https://aidenlab.org/forum.html).\n\n## **Do you want to contribute to the Juicer documentation?**\n\n* Reach out to us at [aidenlab@bcm.edu](mailto:aidenlab@bcm.edu).\n\nJuicer is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!\n\nThanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:\n\nThe Center for Genome Architecture,\nBaylor College of Medicine & Rice University\n"

        "description": "Major updates to CPU, SLURM, and UGER (note that we cannot test PBS or LSF and thus are not updating; since AWS will soon be superseded by ENCODE, we have also ceased development on that branch).\r\n\r\nThis is the last release before we convert entirely to Juicer 2.0 (the ENCODE version, currently under pre-release). \r\n\r\nMajor:\r\n- Intra fragment reads are NO LONGER discarded by default. To discard them from the hic file, use the flag `--skip-intra-frag` when calling \"pre\". This depends on using the latest jar for Juicer Tools: https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Download . Using old jars will result in old behavior (silently discarding intrafragment reads)\r\n- The latest jar has extensive bug fixes \r\n- BWA now aligns in paired end mode. This requires BWA version 0.7.17 or higher; short read and short end mode are now deprecated\r\n- Changed chimeric blacklist to handle quadruple reads and eliminate MT exception\r\n- Rewrite of generate_site_positions\r\n- The default site is now \"none\" if no site is sent in\r\n- Fragment maps no longer included in Hi-C file by default. Before you would exclude them with the -x flag; now use -f to include.\r\n- Dups has a bug fix for some degenerate cases resulting in large memory usage. Also now have flag -j for \"just exact matches\"; this will only eliminate exact match duplicates. Overall this flag is not recommended. However, if you find your jobs are often getting stuck at the dedup phase, it can be because of low complexity or low mapping quality and this flag will allow the jobs to finish much faster. You will still be left with near-duplicates in your library - so use caution when interpreting results. In particular note that near-duplicates are usually machine errors, not true biological results, and thus ought to be removed.\r\n-  Multiple ligation junctions now supported in juicer and statistics.pl script\r\n\r\nMinor:\r\n- The chimera handling script now includes the header and prints out tab-delimited, for better conversion to BAM; it also no longer looks for the /1, /2 but rather looks for the SAM flag\r\n- We dedup collisions now\r\n- An addition to the dups script makes it run faster and with less memory when there are a lot of duplicates\r\n- Statistics updated in CPU to properly handle multiple ligations; also added scripts in CPU that were missing for mega\r\n- Made the names correct in the stats_sub script\r\n- Count ligations explicitly excludes the readname in the fastq file\r\n- LibraryComplexity no longer a separate jar\r\n- No more stats calculation on duplicates\r\n- Java memory options now exported instead of separate scripts\r\n- Multiple ligation junctions handled\r\n- Flag added for  no wobble / just exact duplicates (-j)\r\n- Adding in options to mega script; updating memory requirements\r\n- Making scripts more consistent by having check for system for juicer_tools path",

        "value": "------------\n- **Running Juicer with no arguments** will run it with genomeID hg19 and site MboI\n- **Providing a genome ID**: if not defined in the script, you can either directly modify the script or provide the script with the files needed. You would provide the script with the files needed via \"-z reference_sequence_path\" (needs to have the BWA index files in same directory), \"-p chrom_sizes_path\" (these are the chromosomes you want included in .hic file), and \"-s site_file\" (this is the listing of all the restriction site locations, one line per chromosome). Note that ligation junction won't be defined in this case.  The script (misc/generate_site_positions.py) can help you generate the file\n- **Providing a restriction enzyme**: if not defined in the script, you can either directly modify the script or provide the files needed via the \"-s site_file\" flag, as above.  Alternatively, if you don't want to do any fragment-level analysis (as with a DNAse experiment), you should assign the site \"none\", as in `juicer.sh -s none`\n- **Directory structure**: Juicer expects the fastq files to be stored in a directory underneath the top-level directory. E.g. HIC001/fastq.  By default, the top-level directory is the directory where you are when you launch Juicer; you can change this via the -d flag. Fastqs can be zipped. [topDir]/splits will be created to contain the temporary split files and should be deleted once your run is completed.  [topDir]/aligned will be created for the final files, including the hic files, the statistics, the valid pairs (merged_nodups), the collisions, and the feature annotations.\n- **Queues** are complicated and it's likely that you'll have to modify the script for your system, though we did our best to avoid this.  By default there's a short queue and a long queue.  We also allow you to pass in wait times for those queues; this is currently ignored by the UGER and SLURM versions.  The short queue should be able to complete alignment of one split file.  The long queue is for jobs that we expect to take a while, like writing out the merged_sort file\n- **Chunk size** is intimitely associated with your queues; a smaller chunk size means more alignment jobs that complete in a faster time.  If you have a hard limit on the number of jobs, you don't want too small of a chunk size.  If your short queue has a very limited runtime ceiling, you don't want too big of a chunk size.  Run time for alignment will also depend on the particulars of your cluster.  We launch ~5 jobs per chunk.  Chunk size must be a multiple of 4.\n-  **Relaunch** via the same script. Type `juicer.sh [options] -S stage` where \"stage\" is one of merge, dedup, final, postproc, or early. \"merge\" is for when alignment has finished but merged_sort hasn't been created; \"dedup\" is for when merged_sort is there but not merged_nodups (this will relaunch all dedup jobs); \"final\" is for when merged_nodups is there and you want the stats and hic files; \"postproc\" is for when you have the hic files and just want feature annotations; and \"early\" is for early exit, before hic file creation. If your jobs failed at the alignment stage, run `relaunch_prep.sh` and then run juicer.sh.\n- **Miscelleaneous options** include -a 'experiment description', which will add the experiment description to the statistics file and the meta data in the hic file; -r, which allows you to use bwa aln instead of bwa mem, useful for shorter reads; -R [end], in case you have one read end that's short and one that's long and you want to align the short end with bwa aln and the long end with bwa mem; and -D [Juicer scripts directory], to set an alternative Juicer directory; must have scripts/, references/, and restriction_sites/ underneath it\n\n------------------------"
