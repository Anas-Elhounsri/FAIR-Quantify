Resampling can be done with guidance from user-predefined groups (e.g. morphospecies assignments), such that at least one representative sequence per group is present in the final selection.\nBEAST .XML files are then generated for each resampled FASTA alignment, where the user can apply desired configuration settings. Each .XML file is run in BEAST, and the results fed into TreeAnnotator. Maximum clade credibility trees are then used as input for GMYC analyses (single or multiple threshold).\nIf the user has predefined grouping data for their samples, this can be uploaded as an Excel .csv file. These predefined groups are compared to the groups estimated by the GMYC analysis, and percentage matches calculated. \nThis application outputs:\n1. The number of clusters and entities estimated by the GMYC method for the uploaded data\n2. The percentage matches between predefined groupings and GMYC species estimates; with and without GMYC species represented by single-samples (= singletons)\n3. The percentage of exact GMYC matches and merges\n4. Overall splitting ratios (the ratio of the number of GMYC species to predefined groups)\n5. Which predefined groups were split into more than one GMYC species, indicating possible undiscovered diversity\n6. Summary ggplots that are customisable\n \n"

This indicates the possibility of the underestimation of species richness by the user. |\n|**Match (y/n)**| A means of denoting, in the work-through of the R code, whether there is agreement or not between a user's predefined group and a single corresponding GMYC species. |\n|**Merge**| An instance during scoring when two or more user-defined groups are merged into one GMYC species group. This indicates the possibility of an overestimation of species richness by the user. |\n|**Oversplitting**| The outcome where the GMYC model has estimated more species than those estimated by the user (= \"discordant splitting\"). This could mean either (1) the incorrect splitting into too many species, or (2) the genuine presence of undiscovered biodiversity or cryptic species. |\n| **Undersplitting**| The outcome where the GMYC model has estimated fewer species than those estimated by the user. This could mean either (1) the incorrect merging into too few species, or (2) the genuine presence of lower biodiversity than expected (e.g. variations in intraspecific morphological characters mistaken for interspecific ones). |\n|**Splitting ratio**| The ratio of the total number of estimated GMYC species to the total number of user-defined groups in the dataset. A value greater than one indicates oversplitting, while a value less than one denotes undersplitting. |\n|**(Overall) percentage match**| The overall proportion of successful matches (records of \"y\") in a dataset. |\n|**Singleton**| A species represented by only one individual/genetic sequence. |\n \n"

An example output might be: *C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-17.0.x.x\\bin\\java.exe*. Now set JAVA_HOME as a varialbe in R using `Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME=\"C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-17.0.x.x/\")` Note the \"bin\\java.exe\" has been removed, plus every \"\\\\\" has been replaced with \"/\", similar to how directories work in Unix-type environments.

In a hypothetical scenario, if a total of three GMYC analyses were run, where species Z is recorded as an exact match in two of the runs, then Species Z would have a 67\\% exact match score (i.e. exact match score = \u03a3 (exact match count)/number of input files x 100 = 2/3 x 100 = 67\\%). Overall, with species Z being the only group with an exact match, the exact match incidence in the dataset = (number of user-defined groups with a recorded exact match)/(number of user-defined groups) = 1/8 = 13\\%.\n\n\ud83d\udc1b Species B (spB) would be recorded as a singleton. \n\n\ud83d\udc1b Species Y (spY) and species W (spW) would also be recorded as a merge, even though spW is a singleton (merge type II). \n\n\ud83d\udc1b The splitting ratio including singletons would be calculated as: the number of GMYC species/user-defined groups = 6/8 = 0.75. The splitting ratio excluding singletons would be: (GMYC species - singletons)/user-defined groups = (6-1)/8 = 0.63. Since these values are less than the expected value of 1 (where there is no oversplitting), one can conclude that the GMYC is undersplitting species, or \"merging\" user-defined groups. In other words, the user has likely overestimated the number of species in their dataset.\n\n\ud83d\udc1b The overall percentage match, including singletons = \u03a3 (y) + \u03a3 (singletons)/( \u03a3 (y) + \u03a3 (n) + \u03a3 (singletons) ) = (3 + 1)/(3 + 2 + 1) = 0.67. \nExcluding singletons, the percentage match = \u03a3 (y)/( \u03a3 (y) + \u03a3 (n) ) = 3/(3 + 2) = 0.6. This suggests that the inclusion of singletons resulted in a slightly inflated percentage match score.\n\n\ud83d\udc1b The percentage of singletons = \u03a3 (singletons)/number of GMYC species = 1/6 = 17\\%. \n\n<img src=\"match_merge_split.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n"

Sequences were randomly resampled for 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the 142 cochineal insect sequences (mitochondrial 12S) in the **12S_aligned.fas** file. Each subsampled dataset contains 10 iterations (performed with a set seed for reproducibility). The **cochineal_ids.csv** file contains predefined species designations for each sequence based on the host plant the specimen was collected from (the cochineal insects display high host-specificity, where a particular species will typically only feed on one cactus species). See the associated [journal article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1049964420306538) for more information about these insects and genetic sequences. There are currently 11 described cochineal species, four of which are used as biological control agents for invasive cactus species. These are *Dactylopius opuntiae*, *D. tomeontosus*, *D. ceylonicus*, and *D. austrinus*. *Dactylopius opuntiae* comprises the \"ficus\" and \"stricta\" lineages, and *D. tomentosus* comprises lineages including \"cholla\", \"imbricata\", \"californica var. parkerii\", \"bigelovii\", and \"cylindropuntia\".\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Download the **12S_aligned.fas** and **cochineal_ids.csv** files. \n2. Open the SPEDE-SAMPLER-GMYC R Shiny application using the instructions at the start of this README\n3. Upload the **12S_aligned.fas** file in the **Random resampling** tab in the application. Change the **percentage of sequences to resample** to 25%, the **number of iterations** to 10, and select **Set a seed**. Click **Resample**. For the remainder of these instructions, repeat the process for 50, 75, and 100% of the data, changing the output folder names accordingly where appropriate (e.g. RESAMPLED_FASTA_FILES_25, RESAMPLED_FASTA_FILES_50, RESAMPLED_FASTA_FILES_75, and RESAMPLED_FASTA_FILES_100).\n4. In the **BEAST XML Files** tab, insert the file path to the folder containing the resampled FASTA files of 25% of the dataset (to get the filepath, right-click on any of the fasta files --> Properties --> Copy the address in \"Location\"). Leave the default settings as they are, changing only the **MCMC** to 5 000 000, and the output folder name. Click **Generate**. This will generate a folder containing an XML file for each resampled FASTA file.\n5. Either run BEAST2 from the **Run BEAST** tab by inserting the file path to the folder containing the desired .XML files, or upload the .XML files to CIPRES and run the analyses on the external server. This is much quicker than running it on your local machine, but slightly more admin. \n6. In the **Run TreeAnnotator** tab, insert the file path to the folder containing the .TREES files generated by BEAST. Leave the burnin at 25%, the heights on **median**, and the **Low Memory?** button checked. Click **Run**.\n7. In the **Tracer** tab, check for MCMC convergence, and that ESS scores > 200 for the inputted log files. \n8. In the **GMYC** analysis tab, insert the file path to the folder containing the .TREES files generated by TreeAnnotator. Select the single threshold option.\n9. Under **Upload a csv file with prior grouping information:**, click **Browse**, and select the **cochineal_ids.csv** file.\n10. Under the **Select Group Column:** dropdown menu, select **predefined_group**. Leave the **Select Sample Name Column** selected from the second dropdown menu.\n11. Click the **RUN GMYC** button.\n12. Once the analysis is complete, select the **View Data** tab. \n13. The **Print** button in the **Print all data to the screen** displays the number of clusters and entities recorded for each of the 10 iteration files, and the **Print** button in the **Print summary statistics to the screen** panel displays the average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for this data. Both of these dataframes can be downloaded as .csv files. These are the results using the 75% resampled data:\n\n| statistic        | clusters    | entities   | \n|-----------      |-------|----- |\n| Average  | 10.0  | 10.7 | \n| Standard deviation  | 0.82   | 0.95 | \n| Minimum  | 9.00  | 10.00  | \n| Maximum  | 11.00   | 12.00 | \n\n14. The **Plot Results** tab allows for the plotting of the the number of clusters vs entities for each tree file, box-and-whisker plot for the clusters and entities (showing Q1, Q3, median, minimum, maximum, and outlier values), and a line graph for the number of GMYC clusters and entities for each tree file uploaded.\n\n15. The **Plot Trees** tab allows for the plotting of any tree from those uploaded. The user can select whether the original FastTree or RAxML bootstrap or GMYC support values should be displayed. \n\n16. The **Percentage Matches** tab reports whether there were any merges, and the results of how the GMYC species designations compare to the predefined groups in the **cochineal-ids.csv** file. Using the 75% cochineal dataset, there were no merges recorded.\nThe **View GMYC species list** button shows a datatable containing each sample name with the assigned GMYC species. The corresponding predefined group given to that particular sample is appended as a third column. For example:\n\n| GMYC_spec | sample_name | ids | \n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| 1 | VS086uOE | opuntiae |\n| 1 | VS086uOE | opuntiae |\n| 1 | VS017Ofi | opuntiae |\n| 1 | VS015Ofi | opuntiae |\n| 1 | CSW004E | opuntiae |\n\nThe **View Matches** button displays the percentage matches including and excluding single-sample representatives, the percentage of GMYC species represented by a single sample, and the splitting ratio including and excluding single-sample GMYC species. The **View Matches Summary** shows the average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for these measures. \n\n| statistic        | percentage_matches    | percentage_matches_excl_single_samples   | percentage_single_sample_GMYC_species | splitting_ratio | splitting_ratio_excl_single_sample_spp |\n|--------             |-------|----- |----- |----- |----- |\n| Average             | 100.00  | 100.00 | 6.41 | 2.41 | 2.00 |\n| Standard deviation  | 0.00  | 0.00 | 4.47 | 2.61 | 0.16 |\n| Minimum             | 100.00  | 100.00  | 0.00  | 2.00 | 1.80 |\n| Maximum             | 100.00 | 100.00 | 10.00| 2.40 | 2.20 |\n\n17. The **Plot Percentage matches** tab allows for the plotting of the percentage match; A) including or B) excluding GMYC single-sample species for each tree file.\n\n18. The **GMYC Splitting** tab displays GMYC species splitting relative to the user's predefined groups. The **View Summary Table** button allows the user to download the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum splitting values for each predefined group.\n\n| predefined_group        | mean    | sd   | min | max |\n|-----------      |-------|----- |----- |----- |\n| ceylonicus  | 2 | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| confusus  | 2   | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| opuntiae  | 2  | 0 | 2 | 2 |\n| tomentosus  | 3.9  | 0.32  | 3 | 4 |\n\nThe output above means, for example, that the GMYC method oversplit the *Dactylopius tomentosus* predefined group into an average of 3.9 times more 'species' than expected (i.e. all the samples with the predefined group labelled \"tomentosus\" are expected to be grouped into one species by the GMYC method). The *D. tomentosus* sequences in this dataset are known to contain different lineages/biotypes. The high value of 3.9 may therefore not be a case of incorrect 'oversplitting', but rather due to genuine intraspecific divisions. Each dataset needs to be analysed in the context of what is known about the organism's biology.\n\n19. The **GMYC Exact Matches** tab reports the overall percentage of exact matches across all GMYC runs (i.e. the number of predefined groups that were recorded as exact matches/the total number of predefined groups). The **View summary** button displays which predefined groups were recorded as exact matches in one or more of the GMYC analyses, and how many times they were scored as such. For example, across 10 GMYC runs, a particular group may have been recorded as an exact match in 6, making its overall incidence 60%.\n\n20. The **Amalgamate** tab allows the user to upload multiple files downloaded from the **Percentage Matches**  --> **View Matches** --> **Download** button. In this way, the results of the 25, 50, 75, and 100% datasets can be joined into single files in order to be easily plotted. For example, the four files **clust_ent_data_25.csv**, **clust_ent_data_50.csv**, **clust_ent_data_75.csv**, and **clust_ent_data_100.csv** can be uploaded, and all the cluster data can be amalgamated into one file, and all the entity data into another.\nThe clusters summary table looks like this:\n\n|                  | 25 | 50 | 75 | 100 |\n|------------------|----|----|----|-----|\n| resampled_1.nex  | 5  | 7  | 9  | 11  |\n| resampled_2.nex  | 4  | 11 | 11 | 11  |\n| resampled_3.nex  | 10 | 9  | 11 | 10  |\n| resampled_4.nex  | 6  | 10 | 10 | 10  |\n| resampled_5.nex  | 6  | 7  | 9  | 10  |\n| resampled_6.nex  | 7  | 7  | 10 | 11  |\n| resampled_7.nex  | 6  | 8  | 9  | 10  |\n| resampled_8.nex  | 5  | 9  | 10 | 11  |\n| resampled_9.nex  | 5  | 11 | 10 | 10  |\n| resampled_10.nex | 4  | 8  | 11 | 10  |\n\nand the entities table looks like this:\n\n|                  | 25 | 50 | 75 | 100 |\n|------------------|----|----|----|-----|\n| resampled_1.nex  | 7  | 9  | 10 | 12  |\n| resampled_2.nex  | 8  | 13 | 12 | 12  |\n| resampled_3.nex  | 15 | 10 | 12 | 10  |\n| resampled_4.nex  | 7  | 12 | 11 | 10  |\n| resampled_5.nex  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 10  |\n| resampled_6.nex  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 12  |\n| resampled_7.nex  | 9  | 9  | 10 | 10  |\n| resampled_8.nex  | 8  | 9  | 10 | 12  |\n| resampled_9.nex  | 6  | 11 | 10 | 10  |\n| resampled_10.nex | 7  | 9  | 12 | 10  |\n\nThe resulting summary plots for each measure can be plotted as shown below, using the **Summary Plots** tab. The number of A1) clusters and A2) entities at each dataset size (the dotted lines indicate the expected number of species (n = 5), and species + lineages (n = 11) in the dataset), B) The splitting ratios with and without singletons across dataset sizes (the dotted line indicates the expected ratio of 1), C) the percentage of singleton sequences across dataset sizes, D) Barplots highlighting which predefined groups were oversplit by the GMYC, and E) The percentage match scores between predefined groups and GMYC species across dataset sizes. Triangles represent mean values.\n\n<img src=\"combo_plot_cochineal.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nA1 and A2 indicate that the number of clusters and entities recorded approach the same number of predefined species and lineages (n = 11), and that the asymptotic shape suggests that further sampling in the same collecting areas is unlikely to yield further species or lineages.\nPlot B shows that the user-defined groups were underestimates of species richness, as the average splitting ratio always exceeds a value of 1. The presence of singletons tended to result in higher splitting ratios than when they were excluded, which is more pronounced in smaller datasets (25% - 50%). Plot C shows how the percentage of singletons decreased as the dataset size increased. Plot D graphically shows the predefined groups that were oversplit by the GMYC, with *D. tomensosus* showing the greatest mean splitting ratio. Plot E shows that the overall percentage match scores, including and excluding singletons, remained high irrespective of data size.\n\n---\n"
