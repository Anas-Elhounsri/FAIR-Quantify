KRD method first looks at mutations in the character arrays to estimate  the parameters of the generative process associated with the tree to be reconstructed.  With these parameters, we repetitively        simulated trees with a size and mutation distribution similar to the target tree. The k-mer replacement distances were estimated from the simulated lineage trees and used to compute the distances between input sequences in the character arrays of internal nodes and tips.  Specifically, by examining the   simulated lineage trees, KRD estimated the expected 1-mer replacement distance between characters in the array (including ground state \u201c0\u201d and deletion state \u201c-\u201c) in the lineage trees and the probability for a given nodal distance of replacing a character in a cell array.  To extend the 1-mer replacement distance to the k-mer replacement distance, the posterior probability distributions of k-mer replacement distance were estimated by using a conditional model considering a dependance for the concurrence of mutations.  We found that by considering the neighboring characters, the conditional model can more accurately estimate the nodal distance than an independent model.  The cell distance can then be readily computed as the mean expected k-mer replacement distance.\n \n"
