Currently, the seqX file must not contain multiple RNA sequences. Note that the length of RNA sequences in seqY.fa must be the same.\n\n### 2) Running the program\nType the following command.\n```\ndocker run -it --rm  -v [data directory]:/qrna/data qrna:0 ./QRNAstruct_pair.pl [Alpha] [nCPU]\n```\n\n[Alpha] is the regularization parameter used in Ridge regression.

The parameter values tell us which structural features increase/reduce bioactivity.\nFor example a value of wI_x_i in the w_opt.txt represents the effect of the i-th base of the RNA sequence in seqX.fa belongs to an internal loop.\nPlease see our article for the explanation of parameters.

You can use this file to investivate the position-specific features of each RNA seuence or for the analysis with other machine learning algorithms.\n\n### Options\n```\n-O string  : set the name of the output directory (default:out)  \n-I string  : skip the calculation of the position-specific structural features \n```\n"

Also, by writing a simple program or using software such as Excel, it is possible to extract RNAs with specific properties. For example, you can get a list of RNAs where a certain position is predicted to be on the right side of the base pair. See below for the format of the nnfv.txt file.\u3000By calculating the mean value of the position-specific features for each position, you can obtain the trend of the secondary structure of the input RNA sequences in each position. For example, you can find out that the input RNA sequences tends to have a hairpin loop at a certain position.\n"

        "value": "You can incorporate chemical probing data (such as SHAPE or DMS reactivity data) into the calculation of the position specific features. To do this, you have to put the \"probing.txt\" file in your data_directory as well as the \"seq.fa\" and \"act.txt\" files. The probing.txt file should contain normalized reactivity values assigned to each base (see below for the format of the probing.txt file). After those three files have been placed in your data directory, run the following command.\n\n```\ndocker run -it --rm  -v [data directory]:/qrna/data qrna:0 ./QRNAstruct_single.pl [Alpha] [nCPU] --SHAPE\n```\n\nBy this command, our program calculates the position-specific structural features considering the SHAPE reactivity data in the probing.txt file and optimizes regression parameters based in the structural features. We adopted the approach proposed by [1] to incorporate SHAPE probing data. Briefly, the SHAPE reactivity value of each base is converted to the pseudo-free energy and incorporated into the calculation of the position-speficic features. The pseudo-free energy is applied twice to internal base pairs, and once to edge base pairs. The --SHAPEslope and --SHAPEintercept option adjust the parameters used to convert the reactivity value to pseudo-free nergy (see [1] for details). \n\nTo incorporate DMS reactivity data, run the following command.\n\n```\ndocker run -it --rm  -v [data directory]:/qrna/data qrna:0 ./QRNAstruct_single.pl [Alpha] [nCPU] --DMS\n```\n\nWe adopted the approach proposed by [2] and implemented in the RNAstructure program [3] to incorporate DMS probing data. The DMS reactivity is converted to the pseudo-free energy based on an empirically derived statistical potential and integrated into the downstream analysis as in the SHAPE reactivity. \n\nWe modified the CapR program [4] such that it could calculate the structural features considering the probing data and integrated it to the QRNAstruct program. \u3000We used CapR because it calculates the position-specific structural features based on the Turner Energy model, for which methods for integrating probe data have already been proposed.\n\n"

For example, suppose a user develops a program to calculate the position-specific structural features using energy models other than the CONTRAfold, or using an algorithm taking into account the results of chemical probing experiments such as DMS-seq and SHAPE. The user can use the structural features created by that program as input data for our method. This can be done by making the structural features fit the format of the nnfv.txt file. Copy the created nnfv.txt file to your output directory. Then run our program with the -I option. \nExample (for the analysis of single RNAs):\n```\ndocker run -it --rm  -v [data directory]:/qrna/data qrna:0 ./QRNAstruct_single.pl [Alpha] [nCPU] -I\n```\nExample (for the analysis of pairs of RNAs):\n```\ndocker run -it --rm  -v [data directory]:/qrna/data qrna:0 ./QRNAstruct_pair.pl [Alpha] [nCPU] -I\n```\nNote that there must be the nnfv.txt file in [data_directory]/out/. If the header line of your own nnfv.txt file is correct, both the text data (w_opt.txt) containing the optimized weights and the image data of it will be created. if the header line of the nnfv.txt file is not correct, the image data will not be output, but the text data (w_opt.txt) will be created.\n"
