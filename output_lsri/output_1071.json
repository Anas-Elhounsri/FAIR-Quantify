We'll need a few types of files:\n\n- **Summary statistics files:** We assume that the files are in the standard format that ``ldsc`` understands. If not, please make sure to run them through the ``munge_sumstats.py`` file under Python2.7 included in ``ldsc`` (see [here](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Heritability-and-Genetic-Correlation#reformatting-summary-statistics) for instructions). We also provide you with munged example GWAS summary data of [autism spectrum disorder](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0344-8) and [cognitive performance](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0147-3). Before using SUPERGNOVA, please remove all the SNPs with missing values in your GWAS summary data. You can download them by:\n\n```\n$ mkdir ./data\n$mkdir ./data/sumstats\n$ wget ftp://ftp.biostat.wisc.edu/pub/lu_group/Projects/SUPERGNOVA/sumstats/*.txt.sumstats.gz -P ./data/sumstats/\n``` \n\n- **Plink bfiles:** These are files .bed/.bim/.fam format. You can download an example that we have prepared for you by:\n```\n$ mkdir ./data/bfiles\n$ wget ftp://ftp.biostat.wisc.edu/pub/lu_group/Projects/SUPERGNOVA/bfiles/* -P ./data/bfiles/\n``` \nThese files are from the 1000 Genomes Project, with rare variants (MAF < 5\\%) filtered out.\n\n- **Genome partition files**: These files should be in bed format. Please note that different population may have different genome partition. An example dataset for European population can be downloaded by:\n```\n$ mkdir ./data/partition\n$ wget ftp://ftp.biostat.wisc.edu/pub/lu_group/Projects/SUPERGNOVA/partition/* -P ./data/partition/\n```\n\nMore details about these supplied files can be found in [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.08.084475v1).\n\nYou may run the following command:\n\n```\npython3 supergnova.py ./data/sumstats/ASD.txt.sumstats.gz ./data/sumstats/CP.txt.sumstats.gz \\\n--N1 46351 \\\n--N2 257828 \\\n--bfile data/bfiles/eur_chr@_SNPmaf5 \\\n--partition data/partition/eur_chr@.bed \\\n--out results.txt\n```"

As previously mentioned, we assume that the files are in the standard format that `ldsc` understands.\n\n- The `N1` and `N2` arguments (optional) denote the sample sizes of the summary statistics files. If they are not provided, they will be inferred from the summary statistics files.\n\n- The `bfile` argument denotes the prefix of the `.bed/.bim/.fam` genotypic data files. Note the '@', which denotes a wildcard character that SUPERGNOVA will be replaced with 1-22. Alternatively, if you have one set of genotypic data files with 22 chromosome combined, you can just specify one bfile. We recommend you use the whole genome data as the reference panel although you may only be interested in the local genetic correlation in one specific region. \n\n- The `partition` argument denotes the genome partition file in bed format. Note the '@', which denotes a wildcard character that SUPERGNOVA will be replaced with 1-22. Alternatively, if you are only interested in some specific genomic regions, you can just specify one bed file that summarizes all the regions that you want to look into.\n\n- The `out` flag denotes the file location for the results to be outputted to.\n"

Although methods for estimating local heritability exist, they may provide unstable, in many cases negative heritability estimates. SUPERGNOVA ignores negative heritability estimates, leaving the correlation estimates as 'NA'. So, we recommend the users to focus on genetic covariance instead of genetic correlation when performing local genetic covariance analysis.\n\n"
