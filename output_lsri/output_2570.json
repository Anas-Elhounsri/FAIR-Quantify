If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"jgilis/satuRn\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependences with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the satuRn project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this\nproject you agree to abide by its terms.\n"

See the online vignette on the [bioconductor\nwebsite](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/satuRn/inst/doc/Vignette.html)\nor the [satuRn\nwebsite](https://statomics.github.io/satuRn/articles/Vignette.html) for\na more elaborate and reproducible example.**\n\nA minimal example of the different functions for `modelling`, `testing`\nand `visualizing` differential transcript usage is provided here.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(satuRn)\nlibrary(SummarizedExperiment)\n```\n\nProvide a transcript expression matrix and corresponding `colData` and\n`rowData`\n\n``` r\nsumExp <- SummarizedExperiment::SummarizedExperiment(\n    assays = list(counts = Tasic_counts_vignette),\n    colData = Tasic_metadata_vignette,\n    rowData = txInfo\n)\n\n# Specify design formula from colData\nmetadata(sumExp)$formula <- ~ 0 + as.factor(colData(sumExp)$group)\n```\n\nNext, we test for differential transcript usage with the function\n`testDTU`. This function takes as input the `SummarizedExperiment`\nobject generated by `fitDTU` and a contrast matrix or vector. The latter\nis used to specify the comparison(s) of interest and can either be\ngenerated manually or automatically with the `makeContrasts` function of\nthe `limma` R package.\n\n``` r\ngroup <- as.factor(Tasic_metadata_vignette$group)\ndesign <- model.matrix(~ 0 + group) # constructs design matrix\ncolnames(design) <- levels(group)\nL <- limma::makeContrasts(Contrast1 = VISp.L5_IT_VISp_Hsd11b1_Endou - ALM.L5_IT_ALM_Tnc,\n                          Contrast2 = VISp.L5_IT_VISp_Hsd11b1_Endou - ALM.L5_IT_ALM_Tmem163_Dmrtb1, \n                          levels = design) # constructs contrast matrix\n\nsumExp <- satuRn::testDTU(object = sumExp, \n                          contrasts = L, \n                          plot = FALSE, \n                          sort = FALSE)\n```\n\nThe test results are now saved into the `rowData` of our\n`SummarizedExperiment` object under the name `fitDTUResult_` followed by\nthe name of the contrast of interest (i.e.\u00a0the column names of the\ncontrast matrix). The results can be accessed as follows:\n\n``` r\nhead(rowData(sumExp)[[\"fitDTUResult_Contrast1\"]]) # first contrast\n```\n\nFinally, we may visualize the usage of select transcripts in select\ngroups of interest with `plotDTU`:\n\n``` r\nsumExp <- satuRn::testDTU(\n    object = sumExp,\n    contrasts = L,\n    plot = FALSE,\n    sort = FALSE\n)\n```\n\nFinally, we may visualize the usage of select transcripts in select\ngroups of interest with `plotDTU`:\n\n``` r\ngroup1 <- colnames(sumExp)[colData(sumExp)$group == \"VISp.L5_IT_VISp_Hsd11b1_Endou\"]\ngroup2 <- colnames(sumExp)[colData(sumExp)$group == \"ALM.L5_IT_ALM_Tnc\"]\n\nplots <- satuRn::plotDTU(\n    object = sumExp,\n    contrast = \"Contrast1\",\n    groups = list(group1, group2),\n    coefficients = list(c(0, 0, 1), c(0, 1, 0)),\n    summaryStat = \"model\",\n    transcripts = c(\n        \"ENSMUST00000081554\",\n        \"ENSMUST00000195963\",\n        \"ENSMUST00000132062\"\n    ),\n    genes = NULL,\n    top.n = 6\n)\n```\n\n``` r\n# Example plot from our publication:\nknitr::include_graphics(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statOmics/satuRn/master/inst/figures/README-DTU_plot.png\")\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statOmics/satuRn/master/inst/figures/README-DTU_plot.png\" width=\"75%\" />\n"
