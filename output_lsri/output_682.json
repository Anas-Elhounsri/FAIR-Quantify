        "value": "The CDK is a class library intended to be used by other programs, it will not run as a stand-alone program. \n\nThe library is built with Apache Maven and currently requires Java 1.7 or later. From the root of the project run to build the JAR files for each module. The ``bundle/target/`` directory contains the main JAR with all dependencies included:\n\n```bash\n$ mvn install\n```\n\nYou can also download a pre-built library JAR from [releases](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/releases). \n\nInclude the main JAR on the Java classpath when compiling and running your code:\n\n```bash\n$ javac -cp cdk-2.9.jar MyClass.java\n$ java -cp cdk-2.9.jar:. MyClass\n```\n\nIf you are using Maven, you can use the **uber** ``cdk-bundle`` to grab \neverything, note it is much more efficient to use include the modules you need:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <artifactId>cdk-bundle</artifactId>\n  <groupId>org.openscience.cdk</groupId>\n  <version>2.9</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIf you are a Python user, the Cinfony project provides access via [Jython](http://www.redbrick.dcu.ie/~noel/CDKJython.html).\nNoel O'Boyle's [Cinfony](http://cinfony.github.io/) provides a wrapper around the CDK and over toolkits exposing core\nfunctionality as a consistent API. `ScyJava` can also be used, as explain in [ChemPyFormatics](https://egonw.github.io/chempyformatics/).\n\nFurther details on building the project in integrated development environments (IDEs) are available on the wiki:\n * [Building the CDK](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/wiki/Building-CDK)\n * [Maven Reporting Plugins](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/wiki/Maven-Reporting-Plugins)\n"

        "description": "[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8270947.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8270947)\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\n- Improved abbreviation handling\r\n- More arrow types\r\n- Multi-step Reaction SMILES\r\n- Reaction Set and Multi-step depiction\r\n- More correct PubChemFingerprinter\r\n- Universal (InChI) SMILES for large molecules\r\n- Dependency updates and stability improvements, huge kudos to @uli-f for finding some longstanding issues\r\n\r\n## Improved abbreviation handling\r\n\r\n#991. The Abbreviation handling has been tweaked with more and cleaner options:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nAbbreviations  abbreviations = new Abbreviations();\r\n// abbreviations.setContractToSingleLabel(true); // old (still supported)\r\nabbreviations.with(Abbreviations.Option.ALLOW_SINGLETON); // new\r\n// abbreviations.setContractOnHetero(true); // old (still supported)\r\nabbreviations.with(Abbreviations.Option.AUTO_CONTRACT_HETERO); // new\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full options are described here: [Abbreviations.Option](http://cdk.github.io/cdk/latest/docs/api/org/openscience/cdk/depict/Abbreviations.Option.html).\r\n\r\n## More arrow types\r\n\r\nNow includes NoGo/Equilibrium/RetroSynthetic - #927. See [IReaction.Direction](http://cdk.github.io/cdk/latest/docs/api/org/openscience/cdk/interfaces/IReaction.Direction.html). Examples:\r\n\r\n![#1 (2)](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/assets/983232/968004e7-1747-4bc0-950d-1adbf5d08991)\r\n\r\n![#1 (3)](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/assets/983232/18db4d41-d93d-4ce1-adc9-89367378d98c)\r\n\r\n## Multi-step Reaction SMILES\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cdk/cdk/pull/986\r\n\r\nAn new entry point to the SMILES parser has been added to parse into a \"multi-step\" reaction where by the product of one step is the reactant the the next. The basic idea is to allow more than two '>'.

This is now on by default:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIChemObject builder = SilentChemObjectBuilder.getInstance();\r\nnew PubchemFingerprinter(builder); // new - default is to use \"ESSSR-like\" ring set\r\nnew PubchemFingerprinter(builder, false); // old - for backwards compatible with FP generated with older CDK versions\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Universal (InChI) SMILES for large molecules\r\n\r\n#979.\r\n\r\nThe InChI now supports > 999 atoms, we have the option to generate a SMILES using the InChI canonical labelling, it makes sense to use the larger molecules flag and support more. \r\n\r\n# New Contributors\r\n\r\n* @Mailaender made their first contribution in https://github.com/cdk/cdk/pull/934\r\n* @parit made their first contribution in https://github.com/cdk/cdk/pull/980\r\n\r\n# All Contributors\r\n\r\n```\r\n  75 John Mayfield\r\n  17 Egon Willighagen\r\n   6 Uli Fechner\r\n   4 Mark J.

The patch version was made after some minor issues with how the new InChI code was organised were discovered by downstream projects.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n### Switch from JNI to [JNA InChI](https://github.com/dan2097/jna-inchi). \r\n\r\nThere are two main technologies for calling native code JNI (Java Native Interface) and JNA (Java Native Access). JNI requires writing a custom native wrapper which is then bound to Java code, JNA allows you to call the native methods of an existing SO/DYLIB directly. Essentially what this means is to expose the native InChI library in Java one needs to first write (and maintain) a native wrapper, with JNA we can just drop the InChI SO directly in. [JNI InChI](http://jni-inchi.sourceforge.net/) exposed InChI v1.03 and worked well for many years - unfortunately this project was no longer maintained and as newer more stable versions of InChI were released (now v1.06) an alternative was needed. A few years ago Daniel Lowe started [JNA InChI](https://github.com/dan2097/jna-inchi) and recently made it feature complete and released v1.0.\r\n\r\nChemAxon have also independently used the JNA path to integrated newer InChI libraries into their tools: ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/EszterSzab10/integrating-inchi-and-rinchi-native-libraries-into-java-applications)). It is not clear if this was made available, it is not listed on [GitHub/ChemAxon](https://github.com/ChemAxon).\r\n\r\n## Build on Java 17\r\n\r\nThe Maven plugins were updated to allow building on Java 17\r\n\r\n## Verify declared dependencies \r\n\r\nThe maven modules were checked for unused declared dependencies and used undeclared dependencies (``mvn dependency:analyze``).\r\n \r\n## Organise and restructure test-jar and testdata \r\n\r\nCDK was originally built with the ``ant`` build tool, under this scheme there was a jar for the main/ code and one the test/ code. Test modules could share an inherit dependencies. To replicate this in maven we install and deploy \"test-jar\" artefacts. The project test code was restructured to put all common test code in the \"cdk-test\" module.\r\n\r\nAll test data was stored in a cdk-testdata module, this data has now been relocated to the ``test/resources`` of each module where it is used. This meant some data was duplicated but means the ~18MB [test-jar](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/openscience/cdk/cdk-testdata/2.6/) no longer needs to be uplodaded to maven central.\r\n\r\n## Remove Guava dependency\r\n\r\nWe have removed the use of [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava), the functionality could mostly be directly replaced with newer JDK idioms (Function/Predicate/Stream) which were not available in the past.\r\n\r\n## Use XorShift PRNG in ShortestPathFingerprinter (different fingerprint)\r\n\r\n[Commons Math3](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) was used in a single place to hash paths (Mersenne Twister) in the [ShortestPathFingerprinter](http://cdk.github.io/cdk/latest/docs/api/index.html?org/openscience/cdk/fingerprint/ShortestPathFingerprinter.html). Since this fingerprint method is not widely used and the hashes do not need to be cryptographically secure a simple [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift](Xorshift) random generate is now used instead. This allows us to remove the dependency on Commons Math3. This does mean the fingerprint bits have changed, note the CDK version description is accessible via the ``Fingerprinter.getVersionDescription()`` method.\r\n\r\n# Authors\r\n\r\n```\r\n 137 John Mayfield\r\n   6 Egon Willighagen\r\n   1 dependabot[bot]\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Full Change Log\r\n\r\n- Bump version ready for development [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-14**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0bcffeb2d1)\r\n- Bumped the log4j version [*Egon Willighagen* on **2021-12-14**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/a847162329)\r\n- Make log4j a test-only dependency of the InChI module [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/c2269af6fa)\r\n- Make sure TOTAL_DEGREE works correctly [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/813c120dfb)\r\n- Additional test for converting \"Molecules\" to queries using the useful SMARTS therom: D=X+h. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/064b0a3caa)\r\n- Updated CMLXOM version [*Egon Willighagen* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/17031db591)\r\n- Update Mockito to 4.1.0 - fixing test failures (except InChI) on M1 AARCH64. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/6fb94c1149)\r\n- Add in a Java 17 build [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/361fc6411e)\r\n- Fix indents [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/5cf4b2524b)\r\n- Update Jacoco plugin [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-16**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/ccf5c24b6c)\r\n- Formatting only - to make changes easier to follow [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/d3eb48e782)\r\n- First pass at moving from JNA to JNI inchi - some tests need adjusting. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/074afb474e)\r\n- Fix Test - ignore longer extended tetrahedral - could be a warning. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/8c9e995735)\r\n- 5000L (long) default timeout in ms [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b94ca4f334)\r\n- This is not a status message rather than log - makes sense [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/e4f75ca1c0)\r\n- These tests add the same bond twice a1E=a2E which is now a warning - used to be ignored. The tests were wrong [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/14ef0fa400)\r\n- This is now a warning, there is no EOF status. However it should perhaps set a sensible message [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/a0aae18b58)\r\n- More double bonds added twice. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/7c6b5b752e)\r\n- Message is empty string rather than null. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/4acb6e31c9)\r\n- This is the most questionable change but believe to be a bug in InChI 1.03. Using JNI INCHI setting the chiral flag = on or off we get \"rA:9n...\" without it we get \"\"rA:9...\". In JNA INCHI we always get \"rA:9n...\" - this molecule is not chiral so it seems odd that the setting would change anything. Since this is only a change in AuxInfo this is acceptable. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/664390963b)\r\n- Looks like we can different timeout messages based on the system? [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/4b88908a35)\r\n- Bump log4j-core from 2.16.0 to 2.17.0 [*dependabot[bot]* on **2021-12-18**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/3edc88aeae)\r\n- Some minor version/scope cleanups. Hamcrest should be a test dependency. Make sure we pull in Log4j2 2.17.0. In QSARCML log4j-core should only be in the tests [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/268e172e8a)\r\n- Move over to Log4J2 configuration - allows us to remove some log4j-1.2 deps [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/68b78c6fc6)\r\n- We don't need the Log4J 1.2 API in these locations - unfortunately it still comes in via CMLXOM and JENA but better for now. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/a207f62219)\r\n- Cleanup of the cdk/base modules - using dependency analzye to ensure all used undelcared dependencies are included and unused declared are removed. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/869bfce48b)\r\n- Cleanup of dependencies in CDK storage/io modules [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/d1dfe3a536)\r\n- Significant dependency cleanup in the descriptor/qsar modules. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/8158f35cb3)\r\n- Cleanup dependencies in depict/render module [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/c7c7771962)\r\n- Cleanup dependencies in CDK tool modules. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/dee6b2cd36)\r\n- Cleanup dependencies in the misc/ module [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/6f196f6428)\r\n- Broken by changes to another module - it implicitly depended on the CDK atomtyping. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/5f9ea477f8)\r\n- Make sure everything is used is declared in the cdk-legacy module [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/dca836cd1d)\r\n- More cleanup of base/ modules now I've got better at using dependency:analyze [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/c2dffd67f1)\r\n- Minor issues of non-test dependencies now a clean build is tested [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/fcc9d7221e)\r\n- More left overs - all good now. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/55a00e484c)\r\n- This should probably be install instead of test [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/32575e4dcc)\r\n- Looks like some things were folded into JDK 17 [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b349cfd0bf)\r\n- JENA-CORE pulls in a very specific version XML-APIS. There may well be a conflict but a fix should be to leave it as a transient dependency in cdk-io [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-22**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/777484a007)\r\n- Avoid test-jar dependency for qsarcml - we only need the roundtrip function. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/350ce8f52d)\r\n- This code is deprecated we don't need the full Desctiptor basic checks. Note it may make sense to move the descriptor interfaces to CDK interfacts then the descriptor tests can go to into cdk-test. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/08a15e8625)\r\n- Duplicate some basic generator tests. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/52ffedec64)\r\n- We can from cdk-fingerprint -> cdk-test-standard:test-jar:test by moving the required classes to where they are needed (they are not needed anywhere else). [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/edee240e5f)\r\n- Remove cdk-diff dependency on cdk-test, it only used very basic assertion utilites which we can just write out or duplicate. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/ffbcd9bfe1)\r\n- Now cdk-diff is essenitaly independant we can completely from the cdk-test-inferfaces module and move all of the abstract tests into the main cdk-test. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/00c0287305)\r\n- Eliminate cdk-test-core dependencies by moving some helper classes to cdk-test [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/190a9574cc)\r\n- Move the TestMoleculeFactory to cdk-data/main. I'm not super happy about this but seems like the simplest solution. The other being to make the tests pass in a builder, or have the test molecule factory dynamically find the IChemObjectBuilder - that would be good except for now Java really doesn't like reflective access between modules. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/db19f62823)\r\n- First of let's ignore some trivial tests that check a ChemFile etc is accepted... will we work out how to add these back in once relocated but the tests aren't THAT useful really. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/489ec1a9bb)\r\n- Demonstrates the tests are perhaps a little odd [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/95a8bda9f5)\r\n- Duplicate the expectReader test from the FormatFactory. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/1fb1a62f98)\r\n- Extract out the interfaces for Rgroup queries so we can beter seperate tests. The Rgroup queries need a rethink in my opinion but this will do for now. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/fe925c85a0)\r\n- We will be mocking this IChemModel and so no builder will be avaliable - rewrite to avoid creating IAtomContainerSets (and a temp ChemModel). [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0a99998cdd)\r\n- Mock the ChemObjectIO test cases [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/dc0d2a130e)\r\n- Remove test-jar dependencies on cdk-qsar. We can relocate the required interfaces to cdk-interfaces and add an optional setDescriptor method that takes a builder. We can then move it to cdk-test. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/be2f78db7d)\r\n- One more in cdk-legacy [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/e37dd7365c)\r\n- Duplicate MolecularDescriptorTest for qsarprotein - I would actually vote to just move the two qsarprotein tests into qsarmolecular [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/8e2b3b5702)\r\n- Need this dependency since scope=test doesn't pull in the extras [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-24**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/42749abe87)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency on cdk-charges. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/7f91aa724b)\r\n- Eliminate testdata from cdk-sdg moving all resources to the module (and package) where they are used. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/96566b972c)\r\n- Eliminate testdata from cdk-builder3d moving all resources to the module (and package) where they are used. We need to duplicate one resource also used in cdk-io test. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/c2066cc944)\r\n- Eliminate testdata from cdk-formula moving all resources to the module (and package) where they are used. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/6a4ee0f090)\r\n- Eliminate testdata from cdk-pcore moving all resources to the module (and package) where they are used. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/28261de1cc)\r\n- Relocate required file from testdata to where it is needed. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/6316a00ba0)\r\n- Generics fixup [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/7a9fc684b1)\r\n- forcefield doesn't need testdata [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/a3cff519ad)\r\n- cdk-qsarcml, cdk-qsarbond and cdk-qsarprotein do not need testdata [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9f46478f6d)\r\n- Eliminate cdk-cip dependency on testdata, one dupe needed [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/167a73b20d)\r\n- Eliminate cdk-qsaratomic dependance on testdata [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/2ed0d09589)\r\n- Seperate cdk-qsarmolecular from testdata, 4 files need duplicating to other modules as well. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/f0e982b1c6)\r\n- Seperate out cdk-fingerprint from testdata, 2 test files needed duplicating. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0606795ab1)\r\n- Some collatoral damage - there is a \"defeat device\" that tries to slurp up all MDL files and run them though the atom typer. Probably will just replace with SMILES or at best an SDFfile. For now let's keep it working as we expect. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/c8fcc3c4fd)\r\n- Split out cdk-legacy from testdata - most of the dupes here are for that one atomtype matcher test [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/4ea5fae86a)\r\n- Eliminate testdata from test-valencycheck [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/ba7f25db9f)\r\n- Seperate out testdata from iordf. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/14cb0103fe)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-inchi. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0e863ac007)\r\n- Eliminate the testdata dependency from PDB [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/cd0113495f)\r\n- pdbcml is now independent of testdata - due to cdk-pdb changes. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/ce6d7df5b3)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-libiocml [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/72921f0a1a)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-smiles. As before most of the duplicatations are due to the cdk-core AtomType \"MDLfiles\" test [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/94c5162cbc)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-reaction [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b35412b4dc)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-ctab. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/e7cf80440a)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-ioformats, we need some duplication in core/extra an io. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0e2fff6392)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-io. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b0bd7e7cd9)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from test-extra. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b33dc3a6db)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-test-atomtype [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b8cfb1d4b1)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-test-core. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/7c8e4b758b)\r\n- Eliminate testdata dependency from cdk-test-standard. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/015956cca8)\r\n- The explicit testdata module can now be deleted, all files have been moved where they are needed - remaining files are not used. Note some were copied i.e. for the \"mdlFiles\" CDKAtomTypeMatcher test. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b698c1ab3d)\r\n- Move cdk-test test/ code to main/ - we now expect the modules using it should include via scope=test. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/3d1ecbe18d)\r\n- We no longer need to build test-jars as none are be used. This saves the additional uploads to central. [*John Mayfield* on **2021-12-29**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/dc9585614a)\r\n- Bumped log4j to 2.17.1 [*Egon Willighagen* on **2021-12-30**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/a1d499a472)\r\n- Bumped CMLXOM to the latest version [*Egon Willighagen* on **2021-12-31**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/81896f5eb5)\r\n- We can replace checkNotNull with requireNonNull (since JDK 1.7) [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/5e46d9c0b3)\r\n- There is no replacement for checkArgument in recent JDK's - however the logic is simple enough that we can just expand out the conditions. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/e1abff2827)\r\n- IDE warns about Jacoco version missing from sub-modules (e.g. test-standard) - let's define it once in the parent. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/8a224bf1ff)\r\n- Cleanup some other pom issues reported by the IDE, prerequisites is for plugins, cdk-qsar was duplicated [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/92a03c1078)\r\n- Replace Guava Predicate/Function with the JDK 1.8 versions. This technically breaks the API but is very easy to update thanks to the :: operator. We will be revisiting the Mappings.java to use the Streams API [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/40dabd106f)\r\n- Use JDK 1.7 Objects methods [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0bba331a88)\r\n- JDK 1.8 has Charsets [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/4d20c4fda0)\r\n- Joiner -> String.join, since JDK 1.8 [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9d7940b3ce)\r\n- This was a useful one, the \"official\" calculation is (int)1+(n/0.75) for the default load factor. However in all these cases we expected n to be small - say 100 or so. In which case 135 vs 200 (2*n) is fine. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/cbab6a6c53)\r\n- Fixup - Objects [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9ba8a8384f)\r\n- Replace the XmlEscape from Guava, this was a unstable API anyways. We really just need >/< to be replaced but have handled the control characters anyways. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/d3f5847710)\r\n- Expected HashSet size [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b62c970ca5)\r\n- Avoid Longs.toArray and just create the array [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/80aee43c34)\r\n- Replace Guava CharStreams with normal JDK 1.8 streams [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/2b195240e2)\r\n- Remove Guava caches, one is no longer needed - we have matchRoot now. The second case is technically incorrect as the contents of the IAtomContainer may change so it's not safe to cache here. There is a bug with AtomContainer2.add which will be fixed in another commit - for now we can use the copy constructor. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0457deac14)\r\n- Replace Lists usage - diamond brackets (1.7+) make thinks more concise than the old help function. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/90d3209a21)\r\n- Replace usage of Guava Ints utility. Integer.compare helps as well as IntStream [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9bbae7a3c2)\r\n- Replace usage of Guava's BiMap [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/1b3dae8ac5)\r\n- ImmutableSet removal [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/5a5d384aa2)\r\n- Replace usages of MultiMap - the computeIfAbsent and getOrDefault APIs of Map now make this construct on vanialla JDK easy. We need a slight tweak to our Cycle comparator since TreeMulitmap keeps things sorted by keys and then values. Since the key is just the length we can keep things equivalent by first comparing the length. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/d52ebdebf3)\r\n- We can now use Java 8 streams to filter an iterator - more verbose. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/314cd4b269)\r\n- Remove usage of FluentIterable using the Stream API. Some usages are more verbose but OK and perhaps indicate a List should have been consumed/returned in the first place. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/b3f0f8d2a0)\r\n- Replace Iterables and Iterables usage - alot of this can be handled with Stream's now. Again slightly more verbose, there is one extra case which needs special comment due to mocking. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/02b9d6b87e)\r\n- Here we do the old-school iteration, we canot call stream().count() because it use the forEachRemaining method which will was not mocked. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/f1248f81b0)\r\n- Improved Mocking to allow use to use the stream().count() method. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/d0afb59564)\r\n- Replace ImmutableMap usage, JDK 9+ has Map.of() which is a direct replacement. However usage is minimal so we can just do it the verbose way. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/d20a316a33)\r\n- Remove Guava dependency [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-01**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/fc122daa18)\r\n- Add a test of the HETATM atom types. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-03**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9f8de9bb95)\r\n- Compress the PDB hetatm type_map by not storing the common C.sp2 and H types. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-03**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/bf95024d64)\r\n- Sort the type_map.txt lexicographically for a slightly smaller JAR footprint - add a comment explaining the common type handling. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-03**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/81b9240df9)\r\n- We need to also handle residues that are 100% C.sp2 and H [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-03**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/0d9f17e227)\r\n- Bumped to CMLXOM 4.0 [*Egon Willighagen* on **2022-01-03**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/179ef993a4)\r\n- We don't actually use FreeHEP to SVG output anymore - we have our own SVG draw visitor since it's such a simple format. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-03**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/ff49a2463b)\r\n- Eliminate commons-math3 dependency by reimplementing the MersenneTwister logic. This was only used for a over-complicated PRNG used in the shortest path fingerprinter. A simpler linear-feedback shift PRNG would work just as well here but we want to keep backwards compatbility. Note this fingerprint it's really very good since the fingerprints are non-transativie and can't be used for substructure screening. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-04**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/d447e9ac4d)\r\n- Use a simpler and faster random number generate to hash fingerprint bits. Note we actually set more bits in a test fingerprint so in that particualar case the features were better distributed. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-04**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/5d08f225d2)\r\n- Better comment [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-04**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/827c92eb10)\r\n- Fix HTML5 JavaDoc errors (JDK 17). [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-06**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/83093a7ca6)\r\n- cdk-test code is now in the main/ so goes through the JavaDoc (will fix later) - but we should make sure it doesn't have errors in it. First off there many case of a retrun on a void - looks like a copy paste error. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-06**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9035475db0)\r\n- Some others errors in cdk-test [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-06**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/2a1b1032ee)\r\n- Relocate all classes in cdk-test to the package org.openscience.cdk.test.*. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-07**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/8246b66132)\r\n- Exclude anything in org.openscience.cdk.test from the JavaDoc [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-07**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/f3fedb125e)\r\n- Latest version of JavaDoc plugin [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-07**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/bd751bb023)\r\n- CDK 2.7 [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-08**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/5d9b69e8c5)\r\n- New dev version 2.8-SNAPSHOT [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-09**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/551ee3bb68)\r\n- Update README [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-09**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9cb34c99d7)\r\n- Use HTTPS for EBI plugin repo [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-09**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/9e4556d8cb)\r\n- Move the old JNI enums to a seperate (optional) module - this means the InChI works fine. If you need the enums you can optionally include the cdk-jniinchi-support module. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-10**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/dc13fd000a)\r\n- Include in the cdk-bundle by default [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-10**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/a7675beb97)\r\n- Deprecate the JNI Inchi return/inputs and provide preferred JNA inchi alternatives. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-10**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/804108b544)\r\n- Match the version in master [*Egon Willighagen* on **2022-01-10**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/7ff6a22e2f)\r\n- Make sure we have correct storage order in a bond when reading from InChI. [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-11**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/60a559e0ba)\r\n- Version 2.7.1 [*John Mayfield* on **2022-01-11**](https://github.com/cdk/cdk/commit/8d5821f29d)\r\n\r\n",
