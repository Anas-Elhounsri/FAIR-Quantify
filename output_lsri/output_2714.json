The ROdiomX software is equipped with a DICOM RT structure reading module that employs the\nPlastimatch-1.9.0 software. The Plastimatch software (https://gitlab.com/plastimatch/plastimatch/blob/master/src/plastimatch/LICENSE.TXT) \nis intended for research use only. The Plastimatch is an open source software for image computation in Radiation Therapy (RT) which can be used, modified, \nand distributed without cost under a BSD-style license. The ROdiomX_DICOM-RT-STRUCTURE module enables conversion of RT-structure data from DICOM to ANALYZE 7.5 for image processing prior to radiomics computation.                                                        \nThe ROdiomX software is a MATLAB compiled in form of standalone executable file (for 64-bit Windows), which can\nbe called from the command line and series of graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  \nIn order to install and use the ROdiomX software, users will require a MATLAB Compiler Runtime\n(MCR 64-bit) installation, which is a standalone set of shared libraries enabling the execution of compiled\nMATLAB applications and all its components. \nThe \u2018Morphological\u2019 feature category is still under development and more features will be added                                 \nto it in the next release of the software. The software is capable of calculating 2D and 3D directional feature computation algorithms for different feature\ncategories, as well as various feature aggregation techniques (2D, 2.5D, and 3D) as specified with the IBSI guidelines. \nCitation: Hassan Bagher-Ebadian, and Indrin J.
