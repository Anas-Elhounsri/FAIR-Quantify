Fixed on PR #47 \r\n- Some bonds had NoneType Error because its distance was missing in the bond lengths dictionary. Fixed on PR #50 \r\n- Other small bugs have been corrected\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n- Argparse has been re-factorized and can be call via API.\r\n- Tests have been improved.\r\n",

We have done a lot of work to improve our ligand growing method and make it more suitable to be used in accordance with the real needs of the drug design market.\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n* Force field parameters computation while growing. New parameters and equations applied. \r\n* Growing onto heavy atoms: H not required anymore. More info #20 \r\n* Growing through BOND-LIKE selection. More info also in #20 \r\n* Fragments can be coupled through double and triple bonding. For more info #27 \r\n* More sampling options after growing: Explorative and personalized mode available. More info #18 \r\n* Backtracking of snapshots and connectivity: videos. Info: #31 #32 \r\n\r\nYou will find all the information about how to use the new implementations in the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n* Clash threshold now is a variable argument. More info in #10 \r\n* Distance of newly created bonds is corrected accordingly with its atom type. For more info: #21 \r\n* Some folders have changed their names: \"equilibration\" simulation now is the \"sampling\" simulation.\r\n* The documentation includes more info, such as the analysis tools.\r\n* An automatic analysis is performed after the simulation, generating different CSV files with all the information for each sampling simulation. Additionally, the FragPELE score for each fragment is computed in a summary TSV file.\r\n\r\n## Bugs solved\r\n* Terminal amides now won't change from cis to trans and vice-versa. #11 \r\n* Sometimes the instruction to select a specific H could be ignored. Now, this won't happen. #17 \r\n\r\nIf you feel a special interest in all the changes performed, I strongly recommend you to read the closed issues section.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\nCarles Perez\r\n",

Now allows sequential growing of fragments without any trouble. \r\n\r\nNews:\r\n* Sequential growing completely implemented.\r\n* Renaming.

        "description": "Break out the champagne! FrAG-PELE is already here! The new tool for in silico hit-to-lead drug design, capable of growing a fragment into a core while exploring the protein-ligand conformational space.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n- This first version can be run with simple sh commands. \r\n- It can be imported as Python module (use our functions, it is free). \r\n- The results will be stored in a TSV file. Easy to read, easy to process!\r\n- Several installation options. We strongly recommend to use Conda, but if you feel brave enough try to clone the repository in your local machine and install all the dependencies. And don't worry, soon we will be available in pip.\r\n - If you want to know everything about FrAG-PELE, visit our documentation at https://carlesperez94.github.io/frag_pele/\r\n\r\nWe hope that you enjoy our software!\r\n\r\nThe developers Carles Perez Lopez & Dani Soler\r\n\r\n",
