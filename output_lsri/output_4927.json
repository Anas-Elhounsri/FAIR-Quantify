        "value": "The network perturbation amplitude (NPA) method was previously reported (Hoeng et al., 2014, Martin et al., 2014, Hoeng et al., 2012). Briefly, the methodology aims at contextualizing transcriptome profiles (exposed vs. non-exposed) by combining the alteration of gene expression into differentiated node values (i.e. one value for each node of a causal network model (Boue et al., 2015). The network models represent the molecular mechanisms across wide range of biological processes, including cell fate, cell stress, cell proliferation, inflammation relevant for the human respiratory physiology. Relevant network models used for the analysis in this study are listed in `NPA Model object` section. For many nodes, literature-derived information supporting the relationship between a node and the expression of certain genes is available. Thus, a transcriptome profile can be used to computationally predict the activity of certain nodes. The differential node values are determined by fitting procedures inferring the values best satisfy the directionality of the causal relationships contained in the network model (e.g. positive or negative signs). NPA scores carry a confidence interval accounting for the experimental variation and the associated p-values are computed. In addition, companion statistics, derived to inform the specificity of the NPA score to the biology described in the network models, are reported as *O and K* if their p-values fall below the threshold of significance (0.05). A network is considered to be significantly impacted by exposure if the three values (the p-value for experimental variation, *O, and K* statistics) are below 0.05. The methodology has been described in a greater detail previously (Martin et al., 2014, Hoeng et al., 2012).\nFinally, the key contributors to the perturbation, referred to as leading nodes, are by definition the nodes that  makes up 80% of the TopoNPA score. It both accounts for the differential backbone values themselves but also to the centrality of the nodes in the functional layer.\n\n"
