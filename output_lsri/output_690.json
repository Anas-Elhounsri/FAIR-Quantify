These words do not have an effect on the tagging, since the detected words were too broad.\\\n4- Manual_tag.py: After a human expert highlights the disease and target related words in all descriptions in a word files, these highlighted words are read and used for finding disease and target tags for each bioassay.\n"

Since biological and chemical knowledge is are necessary for overcoming the challenges of data curation, balancing, training, and evaluation, it is important for databases to contain meaningful information regarding the exact target and disease of each bioassay. The existing depositories such as PubChem or ChEMBL offer the screening data of for millions of molecules against a variety of cells and targets, however, their bioassays contain complex biological information descriptions which can hinder their usage by the machine learning community. In this work, a comprehensive disease and target-based dataset is collected from PubChem in order to facilitate and accelerate molecular machine learning for better drug discovery. MolData is one the largest efforts to date for democratizing the molecular machine learning, with roughly 170 million drug screening results from 1.4 million unique molecules assigned to specific diseases and targets. It also provides 30 unique categories of targets and diseases. Correlation analysis of the MolData bioassays unveil valuable information for drug repurposing for multiple diseases including cancer, metabolic disorders, and infectious diseases. Finally, we provide a benchmark of more than 30 models trained on each category using multitask learning. MolData aims to pave the way for computational drug discovery and accelerate the advancement of molecular artificial intelligence in a practical manner.\n \n"
