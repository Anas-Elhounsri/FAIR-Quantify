We are especially seeking people from underrepresented backgrounds in OSS to contribute their expertise and experience. Please get in touch if you want to discuss specific contributions you are interested in developing, and we can help shape a road-map.\n\nWe are happy to receive code extensions, bug fixes, documentation updates, etc.\n\nIf you are a new user, we recommend checking out the detailed [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com).\n\n## Setting up a development installation\n\nIn order to make changes to `deeplabcut`, you will need to [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) the\n[repository](https://github.com/deeplabcut/deeplabcut).\n\nIf you are not familiar with `git`, we recommend reading up on [this guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/#basic-git).\n\nHere are guidelines for installing deeplabcut locally on your own computer, where you can make changes to the code! We often update the master deeplabcut code base on github, and then ~1 a month we push out a stable release on pypi. This is what most users turn to on a daily basis (i.e. pypi is where you get your `pip install deeplabcut` code from! \n\nBut, sometimes we add things to the repo that are not yet integrated, or you might want to edit the code yourself, or you will need to do this to contribute. Here, we show you how to do this. \n\n**Step 1:**\n\n- git clone the repo into a folder on your computer:  \n\n- click on this green button and copy the link:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1581984907363-G8AFGX4V20Y1XD1PSZAK/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGJBV0_F4LE4_UtCip_K_3lZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVE0ejQCe16973Pm-pux3j5_Oqt57D2H0YbaJ3tl8vn_eR926scO3xePJoa6uVJa9B4/gitclone.png?format=500w)\n\n- then in the terminal type: `git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git`\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n- Now you will work from the terminal inside this cloned folder:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1581985288123-V8XUAY0C0ZDNJ5WBHB7Y/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIsGBOdR9tS_SxF6KQXIcDtZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpz3c8X74DzCy4P3pv-ZANOdh-3ZL9iVkcryTbbTskaGvEc42UcRKU-PHxLXKM6ZekE/terminal.png?format=750w)\n\n- Now, when you start `ipython` and `import deeplabcut` you are importing the folder \"deeplabcut\" - so any changes you make, or any changes we made before adding it to the pip package, are here.\n\n- You can also check which deeplabcut you are importing by running: `deeplabcut.__file__`\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1581985466026-94OCSZJ5TL8U52JLB5VU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNdOD5iqmBzHwUaWGKS6qHBZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpyQPoegsR7K4odW9xcCi1MIHmvHh95_BFXYdKinJaRhV61R4G3qaUq94yWmtQgdj1A/importlocal.png?format=750w)\n\nIf you make changes to the code/first use the code, be sure you run `./resinstall.sh`, which you find in the main DeepLabCut folder:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1609353210708-FRNREI7HUNS4GLDSJ00G/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAya1IcSd32bok4WHvykeicUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dq18t0tDkB2HMfL2JGcLHN27k5rSOPIU8nEAZT0p1MiSCjLISwBs8eEdxAxTptZAUg/Screen+Shot+2020-12-30+at+7.33.16+PM.png?format=2500w)\n\n\n\nNote, before committing to DeepLabCut, please be sure your code is formatted according to `black`. To learn more,\nsee [`black`'s documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\nNow, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/new/) that includes both a **summary of and changes to**:\n\n- How you modified the code and what new functionality it has.\n- DOCSTRING update for your change\n- A working example of how it works for users. \n- If it's a function that also can be used in downstream steps (i.e. could be plotted) we ask you (1) highlight this, and (2) ideally you provide that functionality as well.

One can of course also use other Python distributions than Anaconda, but **Anaconda is the easiest route.**\n- We recommend for most users to use our supplied CONDA environment.\n- Please note, you will get the best performance with using a GPU! Please see the section on [GPU support](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/installation.html#gpu-support) to install your GPU driver and CUDA.\n\n\n## CONDA: The installation process is as easy as this figure! -->\n\n <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/71e5d954-75a0-4534-9fa6-7ecc4bf1b76d/installDLC.png?format=1500w\" width=\"250\" title=\"DLC\" alt=\"DLC\" align=\"right\" vspace = \"50\">\n\n#### \ud83d\udea8 Before you start, do you have a GPU?\n````{admonition} \ud83d\udea8 Click here for more information!\n:class: dropdown\n- We recommend having a GPU if possible!\n- You **need to decide if you want to use a CPU or GPU for your models**: (Note, you can also use the CPU-only for project management and labeling the data! Then, for example, use Google Colaboratory GPUs for free (read more [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/tree/master/examples#demo-4-deeplabcut-training-and-analysis-on-google-colaboratory-with-googles-gpus) and there are a lot of helper videos on [our YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjpMSEOb9vRFwwgIkLLN1NmJxFprkO_zi)).\n\n  - **CPU?** Great, jump to the next section below!\n\n  - **NVIDIA GPU?**  If you want to use your own GPU (i.e., a GPU is in your workstation), then you need to be sure you have a CUDA compatible GPU, CUDA, and cuDNN installed. Please note, which CUDA you install depends on what version of PyTorch you want to use. So, please check \"GPU Support\" below carefully. **Note, DeepLabCut is up to date with the latest CUDA and PyTorch!**\n  \n  - **Apple M-chip GPU?** Be sure to install miniconda3, and your GPU will be used by default.\n````\n\n\n### Step 1: Install Python via Anaconda\n\n#### Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), or use miniconda3 for MacOS users (see below)\n\n- Anaconda is an easy way to install Python and additional packages across various operating systems. With Anaconda you create all the dependencies in an [environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) on your machine.\n\n```{Hint}\nDownload anaconda for your operating system: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.\n```\n\n- IF you use a M1 or M2 chip in your MacBook with v12.5+ (typically 2020 or newer machines), we recommend **miniconda3,** which operates with the same principles as anaconda. This is straight forward and explained in detail here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html. But in short, open the program \"terminal\" and copy/paste and run the code that is supplied below.\n\n#### \ud83d\udca1 miniconda for Mac\n````{admonition} Click the button to see code for miniconda for Mac\n:class: dropdown\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py310_4.12.0-MacOSX-arm64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh\nbash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda\nsource ~/miniconda/bin/activate\nconda init zsh\n````\n\n### Step 2: Build an Env using our Conda file!\n\nYou simply need to have this `.yaml` file anywhere locally on your computer. So, let's download it!\n\n```{Hint}\nWindows users: Be sure you have `git` installed along with anaconda: https://gitforwindows.org/\n```\n\n- TO DIRECTLY DOWNLOAD THE CONDA FILE conda:\n\n  - click \u27a1\ufe0f for [CONDA FILE](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/main/conda-environments/DEEPLABCUT.yaml#:~:text=Raw%20file%20content-,Download,-%E2%8C%98) and then click the \"...\" and select Download\n    <img width=\"274\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-09-13 at 10 33 32 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/assets/28102185/ec4295a5-e85c-4ce7-8c16-e6517a2cfa22\">\n\n-  **Now, in Terminal (or Anaconda Command Prompt for Windows users)**, if you clicked to download, go to your downloads folder.\n\n```{Hint}\nWindows users: Be sure to open the program terminal/cmd/anaconda prompt with a RIGHT-click, \"open as admin\"\n```\n\n```{Hint}\n:class: dropdown\nIf you cloned the repo onto your Desktop, the command may look like:\n``cd C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\Desktop\\DeepLabCut\\conda-environments``\nYou can (on Windows) hold SHIFT and right-click > Copy as path, or (on Mac) right-click and while in the menu press the OPTION key to reveal Copy as Pathname.\n```\nBe sure you are in the folder that has the `.yaml` file, then run:\n\n``conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml``\n\n\n- You can now use this environment from anywhere on your computer (i.e., no need to go back into the conda- folder). Just enter your environment by running:\n     - Ubuntu/MacOS: ``source/conda activate nameoftheenv`` (i.e. on your Mac: ``conda activate DEEPLABCUT``)\n     - Windows: ``activate nameoftheenv`` (i.e. ``activate DEEPLABCUT``)\n\nNow you should see (`nameofenv`) on the left of your terminal screen, i.e. ``(DEEPLABCUT) YourName-MacBook...``\nNOTE: no need to run pip install deeplabcut, as it is already installed!!! :)\n\n#### \ud83d\udca1 Notice: PyTorch and TensorFlow Support within DeepLabCut\n```{Hint}\n:class: dropdown\nAs of June 2024 we have a PyTorch Engine backend and we will be depreciating the TensorFlow backend by the end of 2024. Currently, if you want to use TensorFlow, you need to run `pip install deeplabcut[tf]` in order to install the correct version of TensorFlow in your conda env. Please note, we will be providing bug fixes, but we will not be supporting new TensorFlow versions beyond 2.10 (Windows), and 2.12 for other OS.\n```\n\n**Great, that's it! DeepLabCut is installed!** \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc9c\n\n\n### Step 3: Really, that's it! Let's run DeepLabCut\n\nHead over to the [User Guide Overview](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/UseOverviewGuide.html) for information. \n\n\ud83c\udf89 Launch DeepLabCut in your new env by running `python -m deeplabcut`\n\n## Other ways to install DeepLabCut and additional tips\n\n### Alternatively, you can git clone this repo and install from source!\ni.e., if the download did not work or you just want to have the source code handy!\n\n- **Windows/Linux/MacBooks:** git clone this repo (in the terminal/cmd program, while **in a folder** you wish to place DeepLabCut\nTo git clone type: ``git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git``). Note, this can be anywhere, even downloads is fine.)\n- Then follow the same steps as in Step 2 above, adjusting for the file now being in the downloaded folder.\n\n### PIP:\n\n- Everything you need to build custom models within DeepLabCut (i.e., use our source code and our dependencies) can be installed with `pip install 'deeplabcut[gui]'` (for GUI support w/tensorflow) or without the gui: `pip install 'deeplabcut'`.\n- If you want to use the SuperAnimal models, then please use `pip install 'deeplabcut[gui,modelzoo]'`. \n\n## DOCKER:\n\n- We also have docker containers. Docker is the most reproducible way to use and deploy code. Please see our dedicated docker package and page [here](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/docker.html).\n\n## Pro Tips:\n\nMore [installation ProTips](installTips) are also available.\n\nIf you ever want to update your DLC, just run `pip install --upgrade deeplabcut` once you are inside your env. If you want to use a specific release, then you need to specify the version you want, such as `pip install deeplabcut==2.2`. Once installed, you can check the version by running `import deeplabcut` `deeplabcut.__version__`. Don't be afraid to update, DLC is backwards compatible with your 2.0+ projects and performance continues to get better and new features are added nearly monthly.\n\nHere are some conda environment management tips: https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Conda.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index\n\n**Pro Tip:** If you want to modify code and then test it, you can use our provided testscripts. This would mean you need to be up-to-date with the latest GitHub-based code though! Please see [here](installTips) on how to get the latest GitHub code, and how to test your installation by following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOWtKn3l33s.\n\n## Creating your own customized conda env (recommended route for Linux: Ubuntu, CentOS, Mint, etc.)\n\n*Note in a fresh ubuntu install, you will often have to run: ``sudo apt-get install gcc python3-dev`` to install the GNU Compiler Collection and the python developing environment.\n\nSome users might want to create their own customize env. -  Here is an example.\n\nIn the terminal type:\n\n`conda create -n DLC python=3.10`\n\n**Current version:** The only thing you then need to add to the env is deeplabcut (`pip install deeplabcut`) or `pip install 'deeplabcut[gui]'` which has a napari based GUI.\n\n\n## **GPU Support:**\n\nThe ONLY thing you need to do **first** if you have an NVIDIA GPU and the matching NVIDIA CUDA+driver installed.\n- CUDA: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads (just follow the prompts here!)\n- DRIVERS: https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx\n\n#### The most common \"new user\" hurdle is installing and using your GPU, so don't get discouraged!\n\n**CRITICAL:** If you have a GPU, you should FIRST **install the NVIDIA CUDA package and an appropriate driver for your specific GPU**, then you can use the supplied conda file. Please follow the instructions found here https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu, and more tips below, to install the correct version of CUDA and your graphic card driver. The order of operations matters.\n\n- Here we provide notes on how to install and check your GPU use with TensorFlow (which is used by DeepLabCut and already installed with the Anaconda files above). Thus, you do not need to independently install tensorflow.\n\n\n**FIRST**, install a driver for your GPU. Find DRIVER HERE: https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx\n- check which driver is installed by typing this into the terminal: ``nvidia-smi``.\n\n**SECOND**, install CUDA: https://developer.nvidia.com/ (Note that cuDNN, https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn, is supplied inside the anaconda environment files, so you don't need to install it again).\n\n**THIRD:** Follow the steps above to get the `DEEPLABCUT` conda file and install it!\n\n##### Notes:\n\n - **As of verion 3.0+ we moved to PyTorch. The Last supported vesion of TensorFlow is 2.10  (window users) and 2.12 for others (we have not tested beyond this).**\n - Please be mindful different versions of TensorFlow require different CUDA versions.\n - As the combination of TensorFlow and CUDA matters, we strongly encourage you to **check your driver/cuDNN/CUDA/TensorFlow versions** [on this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30820513/what-is-version-of-cuda-for-nvidia-304-125/30820690#30820690).\n - To check your GPU is working, in the terminal, run:\n\n  `nvcc -V` to check your installed version(s).\n\n- The best practice is to then run the supplied `testscript.py` (this is inside the examples folder you acquired when you git cloned the repo). Here is more information/a short [video on running the testscript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOWtKn3l33s).\n\n- Additionally, if you want to use the bleeding edge, with yout git clone you also get the latest code. While inside the main DeepLabCut folder, you can run `./reinstall.sh` to be sure it's installed (more here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/wiki/How-to-use-the-latest-GitHub-code)\n\n- You can test that your GPU is being properly engaged with these additional [tips](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/using_gpu).\n\n- Ubuntu users might find this [installation guide](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/recipes/installTips.html#installation-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts) for a fresh ubuntu install useful as well.\n\n## Troubleshooting:\n\nTensorFlow:\nHere are some additional resources users have found helpful (posted without endorsement):\n\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30820513/what-is-the-correct-version-of-cuda-for-my-nvidia-driver/30820690\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/t/5c3e46ca1ae6cfbb5c5d1ee0/1547585235033/cuda_driver.png?format=750w\" width=\"50%\">\n</p>\n\n- https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu\n\n- http://blog.nitishmutha.com/tensorflow/2017/01/22/TensorFlow-with-gpu-for-windows.html\n\n- https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive\n\n- http://www.python36.com/install-tensorflow-gpu-windows/\n\n\nFFMPEG:\n\n- A few Windows users report needing to install re-install ffmpeg (after windows updates) as described here: https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/20495/how-do-i-set-up-and-use-ffmpeg-in-windows (A potential error could occur when making new videos). On Ubuntu, the command is: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`\n\nDEEPLABCUT:\n\n- if you git clone or download this folder, and are inside of it then ``import deeplabcut`` will import the package from there rather than from the latest on PyPi!\n\n(system-wide-considerations-during-install)=\n## System-wide considerations:\n\nIf you perform the system-wide installation, and the computer has other Python packages or TensorFlow versions installed that conflict, this will overwrite them. If you have a dedicated machine for DeepLabCut, this is fine. If there are other applications that require different versions of libraries, then one would potentially break those applications. The solution to this problem is to create a virtual environment, a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus additional packages. One way to manage virtual environments is to use conda environments (for which you need Anaconda installed).\n\n(tech-considerations-during-install)=\n## Technical Considerations:\n\n- Computer:\n\n     - For reference, we use e.g. Dell workstations (79xx series) with **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS** and for versions prior to 2.2, we run a Docker container that has TensorFlow, etc. installed (https://github.com/DeepLabCut/Docker4DeepLabCut2.0). Now we use the new Docker containers supplied on this repo (linux support only), also available through [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/deeplabcut/deeplabcut) or the [`deeplabcut-docker`](https://pypi.org/project/deeplabcut-docker/) helper script.\n\n- Computer Hardware:\n     - Ideally, you will use a strong NVIDIA GPU with *at least* 8GB memory.  A GPU is not necessary, but on a CPU the (training and evaluation) code is considerably slower (10x) for ResNets, but MobileNets are faster (see WIKI). You might also consider using cloud computing services like [Google cloud/amazon web services](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/issues/47) or Google Colaboratory.\n\n- Camera Hardware:\n     - The software is very robust to track data from any camera (cell phone cameras, grayscale, color; captured under infrared light, different manufacturers, etc.). See demos on our [website](https://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut/).\n\n- Software:\n     - Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu), MacOS* (Mojave), or Windows 10. However, the authors strongly recommend Ubuntu! *MacOS does not support NVIDIA GPUs (easily), so we only suggest this option for CPU use or a case where the user wants to label data, refine data, etc and then push the project to a cloud resource for GPU computing steps, or use MobileNets.\n     - Anaconda/Python3: Anaconda: a free and open source distribution of the Python programming language (download from https://www.anaconda.com/). DeepLabCut is written in Python 3 (https://www.python.org/) and not compatible with Python 2.\n     - `pip install deeplabcut`\n     - TensorFlow\n       - If you want to use a pre3.0 version, you will need [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (we used version 1.0 in the Nature Neuroscience paper, later versions also work with the provided code (we tested **TensorFlow versions 1.0 to 1.15, and 2.0 to 2.10**; we recommend TF2.10 now) for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10 with GPU support.\n        - To note, is it possible to run DeepLabCut on your CPU, but it will be VERY slow (see: [Mathis & Warren](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/457242)). However, this is the preferred path if you want to test DeepLabCut on your own computer/data before purchasing a GPU, with the added benefit of a straightforward installation! Otherwise, use our COLAB notebooks for GPU access for testing.\n     - Docker: We highly recommend advanced users use the supplied [Docker container](docker-containers)\n\n\n\nReturn to [readme](readme).\n"

This is what most users turn to on a daily basis (i.e. pypi is where you get your `pip install deeplabcut` code from! But, sometimes we add things to the repo that are not yet integrated, or you might want to edit the code yourself. Here, we show you how to do this.\n\n### Method 1:\n\nIf you want to *use* the latest, you can use pip and add the specific tags, such as `tf` or `gui`, etc. by modifying and running: \n```\npip install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/deeplabcut/deeplabcut.git#egg=deeplabcut[tf]'\n```\n\nwhich will download and update deeplabcut, and any dependencies that don't match the new version. If you want to force upgrade all of the dependencies to the latest available versions, too, then use the additional `--upgrade-strategy eager`, i.e.:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager 'git+https://github.com/deeplabcut/deeplabcut.git#egg=deeplabcut[tf,gui]'\n```\n\n### Method 2: \n\nIf you want to be able to *edi* the source code of DeepLabCut, i.e., maybe add a feature or fix a \ud83d\udc1b, then you need to \"clone\" the source code:\n\n**Step 1:**\n\n- git clone the repo into a folder on your computer:  \n\n- click on this green button and copy the link:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1581984907363-G8AFGX4V20Y1XD1PSZAK/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kGJBV0_F4LE4_UtCip_K_3lZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVE0ejQCe16973Pm-pux3j5_Oqt57D2H0YbaJ3tl8vn_eR926scO3xePJoa6uVJa9B4/gitclone.png?format=500w)\n\n- then in the terminal type: `git clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git`\n\n**Step 2:**\n\n- Now you will work from the terminal inside this cloned folder:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1581985288123-V8XUAY0C0ZDNJ5WBHB7Y/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIsGBOdR9tS_SxF6KQXIcDtZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpz3c8X74DzCy4P3pv-ZANOdh-3ZL9iVkcryTbbTskaGvEc42UcRKU-PHxLXKM6ZekE/terminal.png?format=750w)\n\n- Now, when you start `ipython` and `import deeplabcut` you are importing the folder \"deeplabcut\" - so any changes you make, or any changes we made before adding it to the pip package, are here.\n\n- You can also check which deeplabcut you are importing by running: `deeplabcut.__file__`\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1581985466026-94OCSZJ5TL8U52JLB5VU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kNdOD5iqmBzHwUaWGKS6qHBZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpyQPoegsR7K4odW9xcCi1MIHmvHh95_BFXYdKinJaRhV61R4G3qaUq94yWmtQgdj1A/importlocal.png?format=750w)\n\nIf you make changes to the code/first use the code, be sure you run `./resinstall.sh`, which you find in the main DeepLabCut folder:\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/1609353210708-FRNREI7HUNS4GLDSJ00G/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAya1IcSd32bok4WHvykeicUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYy7Mythp_T-mtop-vrsUOmeInPi9iDjx9w8K4ZfjXt2dq18t0tDkB2HMfL2JGcLHN27k5rSOPIU8nEAZT0p1MiSCjLISwBs8eEdxAxTptZAUg/Screen+Shot+2020-12-30+at+7.33.16+PM.png?format=2500w)\n\nThen, you can see what version you have with `deeplabcut.__version__`\n\nIf you make changes, you can also then utilize our test scripts. Run the desired test script found here (you will need to git clone first): https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/.\n\ni.e., for example:\n```\npython testscript_multianimal.py\n```\n\n\n## Installation on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS\n\n### Here are our tips for an easy installation. This is done on a fresh computer installation (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)\n\ninstall gcc:\n\n```\nsudo apt install gcc\n```\n\nthen, download CUDA 10 from here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads and follow the instructions... ie:\n\n```\nwget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.1/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run\nsudo sh cuda_10.1.243_418.87.00_linux.run\n```\n with the exception that I also (afterwards):\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n```\n\n**then reboot**\n\nCheck gcc -version:\n\n```\ngcc --version\n```\n\noutput:\n```\ngcc (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04) 7.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\n```\nThen:\n```\nsudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit gcc-7\n```\n\n```\nnvcc --version\n```\n\nthen you can check:\n\n```\nnvidia-smi\n```\n\nand you'll see driver version, CUDA version, status of graphics card(s).\n\n## Installation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\n\nHello! Another cookbook entry on how to install your freshly installed 20.04 LTS system for DLC use. Namely, CUDA, drivers, Docker, and anaconda!\n\n### Let's start with CUDA support for your GPU:\n\n`sudo apt install gcc`\n\nthen:\n\n```python\n\nwget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2004.pin\nsudo mv cuda-ubuntu2004.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600\nwget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.3.1/local_installers/cuda-repo-ubuntu2004-11-3-local_11.3.1-465.19.01-1_amd64.deb\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu2004-11-3-local_11.3.1-465.19.01-1_amd64.deb\nsudo apt-key add /var/cuda-repo-ubuntu2004-11-3-local/7fa2af80.pub\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install cuda\n\n```\n\nThen:\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa\nsudo apt update\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n```\n\nthen:\n\n`reboot`\n\nre-open terminal and check gcc version:\n\n`gcc --version`\n\noutput:\n```python\ngcc --version\ngcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0\nCopyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n```\nThen finish installation:\n\n`sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit gcc-9`\n\nThen check:\n\n`nvcc --version`\n\nAll set! If error messages, read them carefully as they often tell you how to fix it, or what to google :D\n\nNow you can see CUDA, DRIVER, GPU(s):\n\n`nvidia-smi`\n\noutput:\n\n```python\nnvidia-smi\nTue Jun 22 18:46:26 2021\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| NVIDIA-SMI 465.19.01    Driver Version: 465.19.01    CUDA Version: 11.3     |\n|-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n| GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

Simply click to download. For me, this goes into Downloads.\n\nSo, I open a terminal, `cd Downloads`, and then run: `conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml`\n\nFollow prompts!\n\n## Troubleshooting: Note, if you get a failed build due to wxPython (note, this does not happen on Ubuntu 18, 16, etc), i.e.:\n\n```python\nERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1: /home/mackenzie/anaconda3/envs/DLC-GPU/bin/python -u -c 'import io, os, sys, setuptools, tokenize; sys.argv[0] = '\"'\"'/tmp/pip-install-0jsmkrr1/wxpython_aeff462b2060421a9cf65df55f63a126/setup.py'\"'\"'; __file__='\"'\"'/tmp/pip-install-0jsmkrr1/wxpython_aeff462b2060421a9cf65df55f63a126/setup.py'\"'\"';f = getattr(tokenize, '\"'\"'open'\"'\"', open)(__file__) if os.path.exists(__file__) else io.StringIO('\"'\"'from setuptools import setup; setup()'\"'\"');code = f.read().replace('\"'\"'\\r\\n'\"'\"', '\"'\"'\\n'\"'\"');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, '\"'\"'exec'\"'\"'))' install --record /tmp/pip-record-pzy9q5u2/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /home/mackenzie/anaconda3/envs/DLC-GPU/include/python3.7m/wxpython Check the logs for full command output.\n\nfailed\n\nCondaEnvException: Pip failed\n```\nYou can either: remove conda env: `conda remove --name DEEPLABCUT --all`, open the DLC-GPU.yaml file (any text editor!) and change `deeplabcut[gui]` to `deeplabcut`. Then run: `conda env create -f DEEPLABCUT.yaml` again...\n\nthen you will get:\n```python\n\n Successfully uninstalled decorator-5.0.9\nSuccessfully installed PyWavelets-1.1.1 absl-py-0.13.0 astor-0.8.1 bayesian-optimization-1.2.0 chardet-4.0.0 click-8.0.1 cycler-0.10.0 cython-0.29.23 decorator-4.4.2 deeplabcut-2.1.10.4 filterpy-1.4.5 gast-0.2.2 google-pasta-0.2.0 grpcio-1.38.1 h5py-2.10.0 idna-2.10 imageio-2.9.0 imageio-ffmpeg-0.4.4 imgaug-0.4.0 intel-openmp-2021.2.0 joblib-1.0.1 keras-applications-1.0.8 keras-preprocessing-1.1.2 kiwisolver-1.3.1 llvmlite-0.34.0 markdown-3.3.4 matplotlib-3.1.3 moviepy-1.0.1 msgpack-1.0.2 msgpack-numpy-0.4.7.1 networkx-2.5.1 numba-0.51.1 numexpr-2.7.3 numpy-1.17.5 opencv-python-4.5.2.54 opencv-python-headless-3.4.9.33 opt-einsum-3.3.0 pandas-1.2.5 patsy-0.5.1 pillow-8.2.0 proglog-0.1.9 protobuf-3.17.3 psutil-5.8.0 pytz-2021.1 pyyaml-5.4.1 requests-2.25.1 ruamel.yaml-0.17.9 ruamel.yaml.clib-0.2.2 scikit-image-0.18.1 scikit-learn-0.24.2 scipy-1.7.0 statsmodels-0.12.2 tables-3.6.1 tabulate-0.8.9 tensorboard-1.15.0 tensorflow-estimator-1.15.1 tensorflow-gpu-1.15.5 tensorpack-0.9.8 termcolor-1.1.0 threadpoolctl-2.1.0 tifffile-2021.6.14 tqdm-4.61.1 urllib3-1.26.5 werkzeug-2.0.1 wrapt-1.12.1\n\ndone\n#\n# To activate this environment, use\n#\n#     $ conda activate DEEPLABCUT\n#\n# To deactivate an active environment, use\n#\n#     $ conda deactivate\n```\n\nActivate! `conda activate DEEPLABCUT` and then run: `conda install -c conda-forge wxpython`.\n\nThen run `python -m deeplabcut` which launches the DLC GUI.\n\n## DeepLabCut MacOS M1 and M2 chip installation environment instructions:\n\nThis only assumes you have anaconda installed.\n\nUse the `DEEPLABCUT_M1.yaml` conda file if you have an Macbok with an M1 or M2 chip, and follow these steps:\n\n(1) git clone the deeplabcut cut repo:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut.git\n```\n\n(2) in the program terminal run: `cd DeepLabCut/conda-environments`\n\n(3) Then, run:\n\n```bash\nconda env create -f DEEPLABCUT_M1.yaml\n```\n\n(4) Finally, activate your environment and to launch DLC with the GUI\n\n```bash\nconda activate DEEPLABCUT_M1\npython -m deeplabcut\n```\n\nThe GUI will open. Of course, you can also run DeepLabCut in headless mode. \n\n## How to confirm that your GPU is being used by DeepLabCut\n\nDuring training and analysis steps, DeepLabCut does not use the GPU processor heavily. To confirm that DeepLabCut is properly using your GPU:\n\n**On Windows**:\n\n(1) Open the task manager. If it looks like the image below, click on \"More Details\" \n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/a0db3157-2228-4444-8084-36801659f272/installBrandon1.png?format=500w)\n\n(2) That will bring up the following, which still isn't helpful and has caused confusion for users. The %GPU does not reflect DeepLabCut usage.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/117e3573-60bb-4599-b00b-c75276b24173/installBrandon2.png?format=500w)\n\n(3) Click on the **Performance** tab. On that page, click on the small arrow under GPU (it might start as **3D**, and change it to **CUDA**.  \n\n(4) During training, you should see the **Dedicated GPU memory usage** increase to near maximum, and you should see some activity in the **CUDA** graph. The graph below is the activity while running `testscript.py`.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/b1d03ca0-f8ba-4a31-a399-6e86856c81b0/installBrandon3.png?format=500w)\n\n(5) If you don't see activity there during training, then your GPU is likely not installed correctly for DeepLabCut. Return to the installation instructions, and be sure you installed CUDA 11+, and ran `conda install cudnn -c conda-forge` after installing DeepLabCut.\n\n## How to install DeepLabCut for Intel and  AMD GPUs on Windows\nIf you are on Windows 10/11 and have a DirectX 12 compatible GPU from any vendor (AMD, Intel, or Nvidia), you utilise GPU acceleration for inference, with an installation that is consistent between devices. This method uses [Tensorflow-directml](https://github.com/microsoft/tensorflow-directml) which uses DirectML instead of Cuda for ML training and inference.\n\nTo check the DirectX version of your installed GPU, type in dxdiag into windows search and select the run command. In system information, the bottom item of the list shows your DirectX version. In addition to this ensure your standard GPU drivers are up-to-date. Updating drivers by any official means (Nvidia Geforce experience, AMD radeon software, direct from the vendor website) is fine.\n\nThe following instructions are using conda and pip for environment management, executing within the Anaconda prompt program that was installed along with Anaconda python. The # lines are not to be typed, they are for guidance.\n\n```shell\nconda create --name dlc_dml python=3.7\nconda activate dlc_dml\n#specific versions noted that are validated as of DLC 2.2.0.6, but other versions may work:\npip install 'deeplabcut[gui]'==2.2.0.6\npip install tensorflow-directml==1.15.5\npip install pip install imageio==2.9.0\nconda install ffmpeg==4.2.2\n```\n\nAttention: Please note the order of execution of these commands are important, as pip's dependency manager may change package versions to incorrect ones if done in the wrong version.\n"

The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n\n"

        "description": "This is a **MAJOR** change to the stable release! \r\n\r\nThis release comes following 3 pre-releases, all documented (see links below), which we highly encourage you to read. There are major changes since maDLC was beta released in 2020, with massive performance gains. We recommend you use the new conda file, and re-train your older labeled data for best performance. Note, we include a [new COLAB](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB_maDLC_TrainNetwork_VideoAnalysis.ipynb) notebook that we highly recommend you using and/or minimally reviewing for your local use.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/v2.2rc3\r\n- https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/2.2rc2\r\n- https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/v2.2rc1\r\n\r\n**There is a preprint to accompany this release: \r\n[Multi-animal pose estimation and tracking with DeepLabCut](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.442096v1)**\r\n\r\n**How to Use:**\r\n\r\n- To install you will need to use the **new** [DEEPLABCUT.yaml](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/tree/master/conda-environments) file\r\n- ultra quick start `pip install \"deeplabcut[gui]\"` (which now includes `tensorflow` and `wxPython` directly). \r\n\r\n\r\n**Beyond** all the updates from 2.2rc1 to rc3, here are the new features and functionality:\r\n\r\n**Highlights:**\r\n\r\n- note for current maDLC users is that you will find that `cropandlabel` is now within\r\n`create_multianimaltraining_dataset(config, num_shuffles=1, Shuffles=None, windows2linux=False, net_type=None, numdigits=2, crop_size=(400, 400), crop_sampling='hybrid', paf_graph=None, trainIndices=None, testIndices=None)`\r\n\r\n- video inference (`analyze_videos`) is substantially faster + it gives you a performance boost! Check it out.\r\n\r\n- there is now a way to \"ignore\" parts that hurt the animal assembly because they are outliers in the data, like the tip of a mouse tail without many points along the tail to connect to the body. You will get the point later, but for smart assembly, it can be \"dropped\" simply. Here is example code from our latest [colab notebook]:(https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/blob/master/examples/COLAB_maDLC_TrainNetwork_VideoAnalysis.ipynb)\r\n```python\r\n#You can now pick per video the number of animals you fill find:\r\nnumAnimals = 2 # how many animals do you expect to find?\r\ntracktype= 'ellipse' # box, skeleton, ellipse -- ellipse is recommended.\r\n\r\n#Optional: imagine you tracked a point that is not useful for assembly, \r\n#like a tail tip that is far from the body, consider dropping it for this step (it's still used later)!\r\n#To drop it, uncomment the next line TWO lines and add your parts(s):\r\n#bodypart= 'Tail_end'\r\n#deeplabcut.convert_detections2tracklets(path_config_file, videofile_path, videotype=VideoType, shuffle=shuffle, track_method=tracktype, overwrite=True, ignore_bodyparts=[bodypart])\r\n\r\n#OR don't drop, just use this:\r\ndeeplabcut.convert_detections2tracklets(path_config_file, videofile_path, videotype=VideoType, \r\n                                        shuffle=shuffle, track_method=tracktype, overwrite=True)\r\n\r\ndeeplabcut.stitch_tracklets(path_config_file, videofile_path, track_method=tracktype, n_tracks=numAnimals)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**DOCUMENTATION:** \r\n\r\ncookbook v0.1 (#1367) \u2026 d5fe24c\r\nCookbook (#1369) \u2026 6cdf31f\r\nMinor doc edits 3ea5872\r\nUpdate installation.md b09b1d3\r\nnew recipe; update conda name bb54446\r\nremove ref. to tf1 89b5158\r\nUpdate README.md ab5e21f\r\nUpdate roadmap.md (#1422) 0f0b929\r\ndocs added to cookbook 75159df\r\nnew methods section recipe 84840ef\r\nReplace our current bug report template with new GitHub form (#1437) \u2026 fb5e975\r\n\r\n**CODE CHANGES re:installation:** \r\n\r\nRequire scikit-image>=0.17 (#1385) 0ff2350\r\nUpdate requirements.txt c09e97b\r\nUpdate setup.py 59ce980\r\nUpdate DEEPLABCUT.yaml (#1400) \u2026 66ac477\r\nDLC 2.2 for macoS M1 chips (#1430) \u2026 3e28524\r\nLocally enforce English (#1449) 596db65\r\n\r\n**CODE CHANGES re: functionality:**\r\n\r\nCreate videos with all detections from a folder path (#1381) 671068d\r\nallow making same splits (when creating the training-dataset) for mul\u2026 \u2026 9eba3d6\r\nallow making same splits (when creating the training-dataset) for mul\u2026 \u2026 7fe8eb3\r\nPreemptively cast yaml CommentedSeq to list 5afe853\r\nKeep counting iterations when retraining (#1395) \u2026 fa20c0b\r\nCreated using Colaboratory (#1409) a110a21\r\nUniform stitch_tracklets API (#1410) \u2026 d387bff\r\nExtra functions loaded in light mode (#1431) \u2026 0d53161\r\nAllow dlcrnet_ms5 with ResNet101/152 (#1427)\r\nAugmentations not existent in Multianimal setup - fix (#1442) \u2026 a1dec4a\r\nDisplay all animals in the dataframe if none are found in the config  dd55f27\r\nSmart, keypoint-aware image cropping augmentation (#1334) \u2026\r\nFaster video inference (#1263)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis release includes work from: \r\n@jeylau\r\n@AlexEMG\r\n@MMathisLab\r\n@zhoumu53\r\n@backyardbiomech\r\n@intergalactic-mammoth\r\n\r\n\r\n![maDLC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/128385409-cd048f23-9d36-4229-b1e8-dcc6b9d2a255.png)",

        "description": "To upgrade: `pip install 'deeplabcut[gui]'==2.2rc3`\r\n\r\nWe have updated and refactored major parts of the code base for seamless Tensorflow 2+ integration. This means: \r\n\r\n(1) You should update: you can create a new installation from our new conda environment. This is easy, and you can keep your older env for safe keeping! In short, your older projects will work, and new projects will get all the cool advantages of TF2!), but in short its quite a bit easier to build on, so we hope this enables more researchers to play with the base code. \r\n\r\nHow do I easily update? \r\n\r\nSimple: download the NEW conda environment file. You can keep your older DLC-GPU, DLC-CPU for safe keeping. Then, as this is a release candidate, just run: `pip install 'deeplabcut[gui]'==2.2rc3` in this new environment.\r\n\r\n(2) deeplabcut-core is depreciated! \u2705\r\n\r\n(3) The latest NVIDIA GPUs, CUDA, etc are supported! \ud83e\udd42\ud83d\ude4c\r\n\r\n(4) We tested it, a lot \u2026. a big shout out to lead developer Dr. Jessy Lauer for the big PR and testing the code across platforms, GPUs, models and TF versions to be sure we did not slow you down! See full PR here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/pull/1323 and here are some take homes: \r\n\r\nBenchmarked on 4 datasets (single- and multi-animal, w/ grayscale and color images) with TensorFlow (TF)1.15.5 (which serves as reference), TF2.3, and TF2.5; batch size 8, 30k iterations (except for the marmosets: 20k); 3 backbones (resnet_50, mobilenet_v2_0.5, efficientnet-b0); 2 GPU devices (TITAN RTX & GEFORCE GTX 1080). No significant main effects of either backbone or TF version were found. Training duration is reported relative to TF1 training time (Y axis, and value printed above each bar), and in seconds (underneath/within the bar):\r\n\r\n![123963082-682b3400-d9b2-11eb-9c3e-16ccf45a7589](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28102185/124033500-4ce41700-d9fa-11eb-854b-d2674bf07b55.png)\r\n\r\n(5) We have new docs to help you with the transition. This is simpler to install in the long run (1 conda file!) and again just requires you have CUDA (and associated cuDNN, see docs!).\r\n\r\nAlong with this major change there are some excellent updates to the code base for RC3! \r\n\r\nFor the full change log, see here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/compare/2.2rc2...master \r\n\r\nOther highlights include: \r\n\r\n- compatibility with matplotlib changes\r\n\r\n- New projects created with Japanese character compatibility (thanks @bobfromjapan  !)\r\n\r\n- Support images that are smaller (both sides or one side) than the desired crop size (#1318), thanks lab member Shaokai Ye aka @yeshaokai !\r\n\r\n- Optionally ignore some body parts during tracking (#1348) \u2014> this is ideal in maDLC if you have an animal where most body parts are compact, but some far (i.e., the tail of the mouse). You can leverage this!\r\n\r\n- better error messages, small \ud83d\udc1b squashing, and other housekeeping things.

        "description": "\r\n**2.2beta7 --> this release has several bug fixes that improve performance. 2.2 users are strongly encouraged to roll up by running: `pip install deeplabcut==2.2b7`.**\r\n\r\nWe now also suggest that single animal DLC users install 2.2b7; the improvements to \"normal\" DLC are also of interest to all, and extra features like skeleton builder can be used for plotting and analysis, plus plotting heatmaps, etc.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a beta release, it is deemed a stable release (not alpha). the full 2.2 release will have more features, but no backwards breaking functions. \r\n\r\n**we also recommend running `pip install --upgrade matplotlib` if you are using an older env file**\r\n\r\nThis release includes:\r\n- setting of more Tracklet GUI tracking settings is not possible, and better defaults:\r\n  -  Pass more options to the TrackletManager from the GUI\r\n  - Add docstring / HELP button information\r\n  - Now pass minimum track and swap lengths as the in number of frames\r\n  - Huge fitting speed boost!\r\n  - Update deprecated usage\r\n  - More informative errors printed\r\n  - Updated defaults to avoid huge memory use!\r\n- adding compatibility for the fxn \"analyze_skeleton\" for maDLC #750\r\n- speed improvement for batch processing creating labeled videos #748 \r\n- Allow creating of videos with full detection for specific body parts only #787\r\n - path clean up across OS (c293048, b2cefc0, 189c11a)\r\n- Ignore uncertain keypoints when augmenting dataset #741 (when you use the tracklet GUI there is an option to throw any refined frames back into training, but now this ignores low pcutoff points that you did not adjust)\r\n - bug fix in mislabeled data #774, #777\r\n- bug fix: Reindex labeled data to match config individual and bodypart order #764, #762\r\n- `horse_sideview` model added to the zoo! #793 \r\n- better heatmaps are plotted during evaluation (easier to read)\r\n- Tracklet GUI speed/video side improvements\r\n- Fix SkeletonBuilder; if not all parts are ever labeled, still can be used and warning given to the user #763, #756\r\n - Only rely on ffprobe when robust metadata are desired (#773)\r\n* Do not rely on ffprobe at all if robust_nframes is false\r\n - DOCS: added governance & core principles #792, many other small doc upgrades. \r\n\r\nContributors to those updates:\r\ninternal:\r\n@AlexEMG \r\n@jeylau \r\n@MMathisLab \r\nexternal:\r\n@smu160 \r\n@fcatus \r\n@neslihanedes \r\n@PolarBean \r\n@alesantuz \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

It also introduces an active learning framework to efficiently use DeepLabCut on large experimental projects, and data augmentation tools that improve network performance, especially in challenging cases (see [panel b](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/77c92f6b89d44ca758d815bdd7e801247437060b/68747470733a2f2f737461746963312e73717561726573706163652e636f6d2f7374617469632f3537663664353163396637343536366635356563663237312f742f3563336663316336373538643436393530636537656563372f313534373638323338333539352f636865657461682e706e673f666f726d61743d37353077)).\n\nVERSION 1.0: The initial, Nature Neuroscience version of [DeepLabCut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) can be found in the history of git, or here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/1.11\n"

There is, however, nothing specific that makes the toolbox only applicable to these tasks and/or species. The toolbox has already been successfully applied (by us and others) to [rats](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut), humans, various fish species, bacteria, leeches, various robots, cheetahs, [mouse whiskers](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut) and [race horses](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut). DeepLabCut utilized the feature detectors (ResNets + readout layers) of one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for human pose estimation by Insafutdinov et al., called DeeperCut, which inspired the name for our toolbox (see references below). Since this time, the package has changed substantially.  The code has been re-tooled and re-factored since 2.1+: We have added faster and higher performance variants with MobileNetV2s, EfficientNets, and our own DLCRNet backbones (see [Pretraining boosts out-of-domain robustness for pose estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11229) and [Lauer et al 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01443-0)). Additionally, we have improved the inference speed and provided both additional and novel augmentation methods, added real-time, and multi-animal support.\nIn v3.0+ we have changed the backend to support PyTorch. This brings not only an easier installation process for users, but performance gains, developer flexibility, and a lot of new tools! Importantly, the high-level API stays the same, so it will be a seamless transition for users \ud83d\udc9c!\nWe currently provide state-of-the-art performance for animal pose estimation and the labs (M. Mathis Lab and A. Mathis Group) have both top journal and computer vision conference papers.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/t/5c3e47258a922d548c483247/1547585339819/ErrorvsTrainingsetSize.png?format=750w\" height=\"160\">\n<img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/t/5c3e469d8a922d548c4828fa/1547585194560/compressionrobustness.png?format=750w\" height=\"160\">\n<img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/t/5c3fbed74fa51acecd63deeb/1547681534736/MouseLocomotion_warren.gif?format=500w\" height=\"160\">  \n<img src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/t/5c3fc1c6758d46950ce7eec7/1547682383595/cheetah.png?format=750w\" height=\"160\">\n</p>\n\n**Left:** Due to transfer learning it requires **little training data** for multiple, challenging behaviors (see [Mathis et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) for details). **Mid Left:** The feature detectors are robust to video compression (see [Mathis/Warren](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/457242) for details). **Mid Right:** It allows 3D pose estimation with a single network and camera (see [Mathis/Warren](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/30/457242)). **Right:** It allows 3D pose estimation with a single network trained on data from multiple cameras together with standard triangulation methods (see [Nath* and Mathis* et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-019-0176-0)).\n\n**DeepLabCut** is embedding in a larger open-source eco-system, providing behavioral tracking for neuroscience, ecology, medical, and technical applications. Moreover, many new tools are being actively developed.

While the high-level API remains the same, the backend and developer friendliness have greatly improved, along with performance gains!\n\nVERSION 2.3: Model Zoo SuperAnimals, and a whole new GUI experience.\n\nVERSION 2.2: Multi-animal pose estimation, identification, and tracking with DeepLabCut is supported (as well as single-animal projects).\n\nVERSION 2.0-2.1: This is the **Python package** of [DeepLabCut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) that was originally released in Oct 2018 with our [Nature Protocols](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-019-0176-0) paper (preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/476531v1)).\nThis package includes graphical user interfaces to label your data, and take you from data set creation to automatic behavioral analysis. It also introduces an active learning framework to efficiently use DeepLabCut on large experimental projects, and data augmentation tools that improve network performance, especially in challenging cases (see [panel b](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/77c92f6b89d44ca758d815bdd7e801247437060b/68747470733a2f2f737461746963312e73717561726573706163652e636f6d2f7374617469632f3537663664353163396637343536366635356563663237312f742f3563336663316336373538643436393530636537656563372f313534373638323338333539352f636865657461682e706e673f666f726d61743d37353077)).\n\nVERSION 1.0: The initial, Nature Neuroscience version of [DeepLabCut](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0209-y) can be found in the history of git, or here: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut/releases/tag/1.11\n"
