        "value": "Racon is intended as a standalone consensus module to correct raw contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a consensus step. The goal of Racon is to generate genomic consensus which is of similar or better quality compared to the output generated by assembly methods which employ both error correction and consensus steps, while providing a speedup of several times compared to those methods. It supports data produced by both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.\n\nRacon can be used as a polishing tool after the assembly with **either Illumina data or data produced by third generation of sequencing**. The type of data inputed is automatically detected.\n\nRacon takes as input only three files: contigs in FASTA/FASTQ format, reads in FASTA/FASTQ format and overlaps/alignments between the reads and the contigs in MHAP/PAF/SAM format. Output is a set of polished contigs in FASTA format printed to stdout. All input files **can be compressed with gzip** (which will have impact on parsing time).\n\nRacon can also be used as a read error-correction tool. In this scenario, the MHAP/PAF/SAM file needs to contain pairwise overlaps between reads **including dual overlaps**.\n\nA **wrapper script** is also available to enable easier usage to the end-user for large datasets. It has the same interface as racon but adds two additional features from the outside. Sequences can be **subsampled** to decrease the total execution time (accuracy might be lower) while target sequences can be **split** into smaller chunks and run sequentially to decrease memory consumption. Both features can be run at the same time as well.\n"

After installation, an executable named `racon_test` will be created in `build/bin`.\n\nTo build the wrapper script add `-Dracon_build_wrapper=ON` while running `cmake`. After installation, an executable named `racon_wrapper` (python script) will be created in `build/bin`.\n\n### CUDA Support\nRacon makes use of [NVIDIA's GenomeWorks SDK](https://github.com/clara-parabricks/GenomeWorks) for CUDA accelerated polishing and alignment.\n\nTo build `racon` with CUDA support, add `-Dracon_enable_cuda=ON` while running `cmake`. If CUDA support is unavailable, the `cmake` step will error out.\nNote that the CUDA support flag does not produce a new binary target. Instead it augments the existing `racon` binary itself.\n\n```bash\ncd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Dracon_enable_cuda=ON ..\nmake\n```\n\n***Note***: Short read polishing with CUDA is still in development!\n"
