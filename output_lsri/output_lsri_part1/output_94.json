I had a lot of MALDI-MS analyses with ~100 scans each with only one sample per file, and wanted to easily combine all the scans and plot them in a similar way regardless of the origin instrument (e.g I had access to masslynx, but not xcalibur).   \nI found that none of the popular free mzml analysis platforms (mzmine, openchrom, seeMS, etc.) could just merge all the scans of a file (at least not in a user friendly way that I could find), and instead forced you to look at only individual scans. This might be only useful for me but hopefully others can find it helpful!\n \n"

For EIC plotting, the data should be centroided for the peak finding algorithm to work properly.\n\nSelect the mzml file you want to plot with the select file button. \n\nIf you want to only plot a single scan, define the scan in the scan number box (otherwise the scan number box does nothing).\n\nFor EIC plotting, input the target m/z value in the m/z value box (higher m/z accuracy is better for the algorithm).\n\nThe plot settings and annotation options should hopefully be self explanatory!\n\nWhen you click 'plot', this will open up the plotted mzml file in a standard matplotlib plot window where the plot can be manipulated at will, and saved in various file formats (I recommend SVG).\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n"
