The first module consists of an ensemble of Deep Learning models to \nreject proteins, that do not belong to any immune system. The second module uses an ensemble of Deep Learning models\nto classify proteins. We use a Deep Open Classifier (DOC) together with temperature scaling to calibrate our models.\nThe calibration allows us to either 1) reject proteins 2) classifiy them as a known type or 3) classify them as\nan unknown, potentially new type of protein. \n"
