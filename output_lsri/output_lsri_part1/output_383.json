We strive to expand access to behavioral research technology for all, encompassing both academic researchers and the broader public of various backgrounds and resources. The LabGym initiative welcomes contributions from diverse backgrounds and values a wide range of skills and perspectives. With this goal in mind, we have adopted this code of conduct and require all contributors to agree and adhere to these guidelines in order to help us create a safe and positive community for all.\n\n## Guidelines Overview\n\n* All participants must feel safe, regardless of their diverse backgrounds (including family status, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, native language, age, ability, race, ethnicity, national origin, socioeconomic status, religion, geographic location, or any other dimension of diversity).\n* This code applies to all LabGym activities, including offline and online interactions, public representations, and community forums.\n\n## Expected Behaviors\n\n* **Respect:** Value differing viewpoints, be open to being wrong, and maintain civility in all discussions.\n* **Professionalism:** Speak honestly and directly, respecting others even during disagreements.\n* **Inclusivity:** Encourage diverse perspectives and voices, particularly from less dominant group members.\n* **Understanding:** Embrace differing ideas to enrich our work, avoiding a 'win-at-all-costs' mentality.\n* **Leadership:** Lead by example, promoting inclusivity in actions and words.\n\n## Unacceptable Behaviors\n\n*\tViolence, threats, and personal attacks.\n*\tDerogatory language and unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact.\n*\tDisruptive behavior in events and forums.\n\n## Consequences\n\n*\tNon-tolerance of bad behavior, with immediate compliance expected when asked to stop.\n*\tConsequences include temporary or permanent exclusion from LabGym activities.\n\n## Reporting\n\nReport unacceptable behavior to bingye@umich.edu. Reports will be reviewed, investigated, and appropriate resources offered.\n\n## Modifications\n\nThe University of Michigan LabGym team may amend these guidelines, with your agreement deemed as acceptance of changes.\n"

Together, these modules create a cohesive workflow, enabling users to prepare, train, and analyze their behavioral data with accuracy and ease.\n\n1. **'Preprocessing Module'**: This module is for optimizing video footage for analysis. It can trim videos to focus solely on the necessary time windows, crop frames to remove irrelevant regions, enhance video contrast to make the relevant details more discernible, reduce video fps to increase processing speed, or draw colored markers in videos to mark specific locations.\n\n2. **'Training Module'**: Here, you can customize LabGym according to your specific research needs. You can train a Detector in this module to detect animals or objects of your interest in videos/images. You can also train a Categorizer to recognize specific behaviors that are defined by you.\n\n3. **'Analysis Module'**: After customizing LabGym to your need, you can use this module for automated behavioral analysis in videos/images. It not only outputs comprehensive analysis results but also delves into these results to mine significant findings.\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

It does not require training neural networks, but you need to define a time window during which the animals are in motion for effective background extraction. A shorter time window leads to quicker processing. Typically, a duration of 10 to 30 seconds is adequate.\n\n***How to select an appropriate time window for background extraction?***\n\nTo determine the optimal time window for background extraction, consider the animal's movement throughout the video. In the example below, in a 60-second video, selecting a 20-second window where the mouse moves frequently and covers different areas is ideal. The following three images are backgrounds extracted using the time windows of the first, second, and last 20 seconds, respectively. In the first and last 20 seconds, the mouse mostly stays either in left or right side and moves little and the extracted backgrounds contain animal trace, which is not ideal. In the second 20 seconds, the mouse frequently moves around and the extracted background is perfect:\n\n![alt text](https://github.com/yujiahu415/LabGym/blob/master/Examples/Background_extraction_demo.gif?raw=true)  ![alt text](https://github.com/yujiahu415/LabGym/blob/master/Examples/Extracted_background_0-20.jpg?raw=true)  ![alt text](https://github.com/yujiahu415/LabGym/blob/master/Examples/Extracted_background_20-40.jpg?raw=true)  ![alt text](https://github.com/yujiahu415/LabGym/blob/master/Examples/Extracted_background_40-60.jpg?raw=true)\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

To enhance processing speed, use a GPU or reduce the frame size during analysis. To train a **Detector** in **\u2018Training Module\u2019**: \n\n   1. Click the **\u2018Generate Image Examples\u2019** button to extract image frames from videos.\n   2. Use free online annotation tools like [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) to annotate the outlines of animals or objects in these images. For annotation type, choose 'Instance Segmentation', and export the annotations in 'COCO instance segmentation' format, which generates a \u2018*.json\u2019 file. Importantly, when you generate a version of dataset, do NOT perform any preprocessing steps such as \u2018auto orient\u2019 and \u2018resize (stretch)\u2019. Instead, perform some augmentation based on which manipulations may occur in real scenarios.\n   3.
