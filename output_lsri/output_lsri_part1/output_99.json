        "value": "# Installation\n\nAlphaDIA can be installed on Windows, macOS and Linux. Please choose the preferred installation:\n\n* [**One-click GUI installation:**](#one-click-gui-installation) Choose this installation if you only want the GUI and/or keep things as simple as possible.\n\n* [**Pip installation**](#pip-installation)This version allows you to use alphaDIA as a package within your conda environment. You will only have access to the search engine backend and the command line but not the GUI.\n\n* [**Developer installation:**](#developer-installation) This installation allows to modify alphaDIA's source code directly. Generally, the developer version of alphaDIA outperforms the precompiled versions which makes this the installation of choice for high-throughput experiments.\n\n* [**Docker installation:**](#docker-installation) Choose this for running alphaDIA in a Docker container, which is useful if you want to run it in a cloud environment.\n\n* [**Slurm installation:**](#slurm-cluster-installation) Choose this for running alphaDIA on a research cluster with Slurm.\n\n## One-click GUI installation\nCurrently available for **MacOS** and **Windows**.\nYou can download the latest release of alphaDIA [here](https://github.com/Mannlabs/alphadia/releases/latest).\n\n* **Windows:** Download the latest `win-x64` build. Save it and double click it to install. If you receive a warning during installation click *Run anyway*.\n* **MacOS:** Download the latest `darwin-arm64` build. Please note that alphaDIA currently requires an ARM based M1/2/3 processor for the one-click installer. Save the installer and open the parent folder in Finder. Right-click and select *open*. If you receive a warning during installation click *Open*. If you want to use `.raw` files on Thermo instruments alphaRaw is required, which depends on Mono. A detailed guide to installing alphaRaw with mono can be found [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw#installation).\n\nAs of now, **Linux** users need follow the steps for the\n[developer installation](#developer-installation) in order to use the GUI.\n\n## Pip installation\nIf you want to use alphaDIA as a python library (e.g. for importing it into Jupyter notebooks) or only use the command-line interface,\nyou can install alphaDIA via `pip`.\n\n### 1. Prerequisites\nPlease make sure you have a valid installation of conda or miniconda.\nWe recommend setting up miniconda as described on their [website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/).\n\nIf you want to use `.raw` files on Thermo instruments alphaRaw is required, which depends on Mono.\nA detailed guide to installing alphaRaw with mono can be found [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw#installation), a short version is given\n[below](#2-installing-mono).\n\n### 2. Setting up the environment\n\nIt is highly recommended to use a conda environment for the installation of alphaDIA.\nThis ensures that all dependencies are installed correctly and do not interfere with other packages.\n```bash\nconda create -n alphadia python=3.11 -y\nconda activate alphadia\n```\n\n### 3. Installing alphaDIA\nFinally, alphaDIA and all its dependencies can be installed by\n```bash\npip install \"alphadia[stable]\"\n```\nWe strongly recommend using the `stable` version, which has all dependencies fixed,\nfor reasons of reproducibility and integrity.\n\nAlternatively, use\n`pip install alphadia`, which comes with less version constraints. This is not recommended, but may be useful to avoid\nversion clashes if alphaDIA is imported as a library into a defined python requirement.\nNote however, that this \"loose\" version might be affected e.g. by breaking changes of third-party dependencies.\n\nFinally, run `alphadia -v` to check if the installation was successful;\n`alphadia -h` will give you a list of command-line options.\n\n\n## Developer installation\nAlphaDIA can be installed in editable (i.e. developer) mode. This allows to fully customize the software and even modify the source code to your specific needs. When an editable Python package is installed, its source code is stored in a location of your choice.\n\nMake sure you have a conda environment and Mono installed for reading `.raw` files as described [here](https://github.com/MannLabs/alpharaw#installation).\n\nSee also the [developer guide](developer_guide.md) for more information on how to contribute to alphaDIA.\n\n### 1. Setting up the repository\n\nNavigate to a folder where you would like to install alphaDIA and\n download the alphaDIA repository. This creates a subfolder `alphadia` in your current directory\n```bash\ncd ~/work/search_engines\ngit clone git@github.com:MannLabs/alphadia.git\ncd alphadia\n```\n\nOptionally, to get the latest features, switch to the `development` branch and pull the most recent version\n```bash\ngit switch development\ngit pull\n```\n\n### 2. Installation: backend\nSet up a conda environment and activate it as described [here](#2-setting-up-the-environment).\n\nUse pip to install alphaDIA, using the `development` tag to install additional packages required for development only\n```bash\npip install -e \".[stable,development]\"\n```\nIf you need less strict versions for third-party dependencies, use `pip install -e \".[development]\"`.\n\nNote: by using the editable flag `-e`, all modifications to the alphaDIA source code folder are directly reflected when running alphaDIA. Note that the alphaDIA folder cannot be moved and/or renamed if an editable version is installed.\n\n\n### 3. Installation: GUI (optional)\n\nIf you want to use or extend the GUI, please install NodeJS as described on their [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).\n\nInstall all frontend packages using npm\n```bash\ncd gui\nnpm install\n```\nNote that this gui install only works if the conda environment is called \"`alphadia`\",\nunless the \"envName\" variables in `profile.js` are adjusted.\n\nThe GUI can then be started by typing\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## Docker Installation\nThe containerized version can be used to run alphaDIA e.g. on cloud platforms.\nIt can be used to run alphaDIA for multiple input files, as well as for single files only\n(trivial parallelization on computing clusters).\n\nNote that this container is not optimized neither for performance nor size yet, and does not run on Apple Silicon chips\n(M1/M2/M3) due to problems with mono. Also, it currently relies on the input files being organized\nin a specific folder structure.\n\n### 1. Setting up Docker\nInstall the latest version of docker (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n\n### 2. Prepare folder structure\nSet up your data to match the expected folder structure:\n- Create a folder and store its name in a variable, e.g. `DATA_FOLDER=/home/username/data; mkdir -p $DATA_FOLDER`\n- In this folder, create 4 subfolders:\n  - `library`: put your library file here, make it writeable for any user (`chmod o+rw *`)\n  - `raw`: put your raw data here\n  - `output`: make this folder writeable for any user: `chmod -R o+rwx output` (this is where the output files will be stored)\n  - `config`: create a file named `config.yaml` here, with the following content:\n```yaml\nlibrary: /app/data/library/LIBRARY_FILE.hdf\nraw_path_list:\n  - /app/data/raw/RAW_FILE_1.raw\n  - /app/data/raw/RAW_FILE_2.raw\n  - ...\noutput_directory: /app/data/output\n```\n  Substitute `LIBRARY_FILE` and `RAW_FILE` with your respective file names, but preserve the `/app/data/../` prefix.\n  The rest of the config values are taken from `default.yaml`, unless you overwrite any value from there\n  in your `config.yaml`.\n\n### 3. Start the container\n```bash\ndocker run -v $DATA_FOLDER:/app/data/ mannlabs/alphadia:latest\n```\nAfter initial download of the container, alphaDIA will start running immediately. Alternatively, you can run an interactive session with\n`docker run -v $DATA_FOLDER:/app/data/ -it mannlabs/alphadia:latest bash`\n\n### 4. (Advanced) Build the image yourself\nIf you want to build the image yourself, you can do so by\n```bash\ndocker build -t alphadia-docker .\n```\nand run it with\n```bash\ndocker run -v $DATA_FOLDER:/app/data/ --rm alphadia-docker\n```\n\n## Slurm cluster Installation\n\n### 1. Set up environment\nCheck if conda is available on your cluster. If not, install it, or, if provided, load the corresponding module, e.g.\n`module load anaconda/3/2023.03`. You might be asked to run `conda init bash` to initialize conda.\n\nCreate and activate a new conda environment\n```bash\nconda create -n alphadia -y\nconda activate alphadia\n```\n### 2. Installing mono\nInstall mono to support reading proprietary vendor formats like Thermo `.raw` files.\n\n\nInstall python into your new environment\n```bash\nconda install python=3.11 -y\n```\nThen install mono by\n```bash\nconda install mono=6.12.0.182 -c anaconda -y\n```\n\nTest that mono is correctly installed by running\n```bash\nmono --version\n```\n\nThe output should look something like this:\n```\nMono JIT compiler version 6.12.0.182 (tarball Mon Jun 26 17:39:19 UTC 2023)\nCopyright (C) 2002-2014 Novell, Inc, Xamarin Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com\n\tTLS:           __thread\n\tSIGSEGV:       altstack\n\tNotifications: epoll\n\tArchitecture:  amd64\n\tDisabled:      none\n\tMisc:          softdebug\n\tInterpreter:   yes\n\tLLVM:          supported, not enabled.\n\tSuspend:       hybrid\n\tGC:            sgen (concurrent by default)\n```\n\n\n### 3. Installing alphaDIA\n\nInstall alphaDIA using pip:\n```bash\npip install \"alphadia[stable]\"\n```\nAfterward, verify the alphaDIA installation by running:\n`alphadia --version` which should output the current version.\n\n### Notes on running alphaDIA as part of automated workflows\nAlphaDIA is designed to be run in a headless mode. In case of an error, a nonzero exit code is returned.\nA exit code of 127 indicates that there was an unknown error. All other nonzero exit codes pertain to\n'business errors', i.e. those caused most likely by user input (data and/or configuration).\n\nFurther details on such errors can be found in the `events.jsonl` file in the `.progress` folder(s) of the output directory.\n\n### Slurm script example\nYou can find an example of a Slurm script here: [./tests/e2e_tests/e2e_slurm.sh](./tests/e2e_tests/e2e_slurm.sh).\n"

You will only have access to the search engine backend and the command line but not the GUI.\n\n* [**Developer installation:**](docs/installation.md#developer-installation) This installation allows to modify alphaDIA's source code directly. Generally, the developer version of alphaDIA outperforms the precompiled versions which makes this the installation of choice for high-throughput experiments.\n\n* [**Docker installation:**](docs/installation.md#use-the-dockerized-version) Choose this for running alphaDIA in a Docker container, which is useful if you want to run it in a cloud environment.\n\n* [**Slurm installation:**](docs/installation.md#slurm-cluster-installation) Choose this for running alphaDIA on a research cluster with Slurm.\n"

This is not recommended, but may be useful to avoid\nversion clashes if alphaDIA is imported as a library into a defined python requirement.\nNote however, that this \"loose\" version might be affected e.g. by breaking changes of third-party dependencies.\n\nFinally, run `alphadia -v` to check if the installation was successful;\n`alphadia -h` will give you a list of command-line options.\n\n---"
