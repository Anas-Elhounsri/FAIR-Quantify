RustIMS draws inspiration from OpenMS but is distinguished by its use of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as the backend language, aiming for efficient algorithm implementations and robust data structures. Like OpenMS, rustims exposes most of its logic to Python via [pyO3](https://docs.rs/pyo3/latest/pyo3/). This setup is intended to enable quick prototyping and integration into existing scientific workflows.\n \n"
