Run the following script from the project home directory to take one patch from the whole section as an example:\n```\npython patch_cut.py\n```\nThen use the following python code to run SCS on the example patch or run the `example.py` script:\n```\nfrom src import scs\n\nbin_file = 'data/Mouse_brain_Adult_GEM_bin1_sub.tsv'\nimage_file = 'data/Mouse_brain_Adult_sub.tif'\nscs.segment_cells(bin_file, image_file, align='rigid')\n```\nUse `help(scs.segment_cells)` in python to see more instructions on the usages.\n\nThe `segment_cells` function will run three steps to segment the provided patch: (*i*) preprocessing, *i.e.*, identifying nuclei and preparing data for the transformer, (*ii*) training the transformer and inference on all the spots in the patch, (*iii*), postprocessing, *i.e.*, gradient flow tracking. The preprocessing time on the demo patch will be about 10 minutes, transformer training will take roughly 1 hour with an Nvidia GeForce 10 series graphics card, and the postprocessing will take about 5 minutes.\n"
