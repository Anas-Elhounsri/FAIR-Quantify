If not specified otherwise, the data will be stored in `.genomic_benchmarks` subfolder of your home directory. By default, the dataset is obtained from our cloud cache (`use_cloud_cache=True`). \n\n```python\n>>> from genomic_benchmarks.loc2seq import download_dataset\n>>> \n>>> download_dataset(\"human_nontata_promoters\", version=0)\nDownloading 1VdUg0Zu8yfLS6QesBXwGz1PIQrTW3Ze4 into /home/petr/.genomic_benchmarks/human_nontata_promoters.zip...
