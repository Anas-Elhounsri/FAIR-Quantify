Ensembl id according to the transcript of the gene in 5\u2019\n  8. Ensembl id according to the transcript of the gene in 3\u2019\n\n  Tips:\n  - when the exon number is not known, write a dot in the corresponding field of the file\n  - gene pairs fusing the same two genes in multiple breakpoints should be listed one after the other\n\n  \n  An example of _translocation_list.txt_ is:\n  \n      BCR      ABL1      14   2    1    15    ENST00000305877    ENST00000372348\n      KMT2A    MLLT1     9    2    .    .

Nevertheless, it is advisable to run the analysis only on the gene pair/s of interest, in order to reduce computational time\n\n- _sample_list.txt_: file with the list of samples to be analyzed. The file format is a tab-separated text file, with the sample name in the first column and the path to the RNA-seq file in the second (for single-end data) or in the second and third columns (for paired-end data). Sample order doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n  An example of _sample_list.txt_ (SE) is:\n\n      SAMPLE1    /data/reads/sample1_SE.fq.gz\n      SAMPLE2    /data/reads/sample2_SE.fq.gz\n\n  An example of _sample_list.txt_ (PE) is:\n\n      SAMPLE1           /data/reads/sample1_PE_1.fq.gz        /data/reads/sample1_PE_2.fq.gz\n      SAMPLE2           /data/reads/sample2_PE_1.fq.gz        /data/reads/sample2_PE_2.fq.gz\n     \n- _path_file.txt_: file with the paths for Ensembl annotation and genome files. The file format is a text file with a path written in each row, __in the following order__:\n  1. path to annotation file\n  2. path to genome file\n  \n  An example of _path_files.txt_ is:\n  \n      /data/annotation/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.104.gtf\n      /data/annotation/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa\n\n  The gene annotation (in GTF format) and the genome sequence (in FASTA format) files must be downloaded by the user from the Ensembl database and placed into the _annotation_/ directory contained in the project directory. Annotation and genome files for Homo sapiens (GRCh38) can be downloaded from http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-N/gtf/homo_sapiens/ and http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-N/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/, respectively (replace N with the chosen release number, f.i. 104).\n\n- _params_Star.txt_: file with the parameters used by Star embedded in CircFusion. The file format is a text file with a parameter written in each row, __in the following order__:\n\n  1. number of threads for the analysis;\n  2. uncompression command; the default is _\u201czcat\u201d_ for gzip compressed file (.gz);\n  3. maximum number of multiple alignments allowed (default value 10);\n  4. minimum number of matches required for the alignment (default value 5);\n  5. maximum number of mismatches allowed in the alignment (default value 4);\n  6. maximum number of mismatches allowed per pair relative to read length (default value 0.01);\n  7. maximum number of mismatches allowed for stitching of the splice junctions (default value -1 -1 -1 -1).\n\n  An example of _params_Star.txt_ is:\n  \n      10\n      \"zcat\"\n      10\n       \n       \n      0.01\n      -1 -1 -1 -1\n\n- _params_fusions.txt_: file with the parameters used by CircFusion to define fusion transcripts. The file format is a text file with a parameter written in each row, __in the following order__:\n\n  1. maximum percentage of mismatches allowed at the size of shorter overlap over the fusion junction (default value 17);\n  2. minimum number of nucleotides overlapping the fusion junction (default value 5);\n  3. minimum number of nucleotides mapping in the alignment (default value 50);\n  4. library strand; allowed values are \"+\", \"-\" or \"UN\", for stranded, reverse stranded or unstranded RNASeq, respectively (default value \u201c+\u201d).\n\n  An example of _params_fusions.txt_ is:\n\n      17\n      5\n       \n      +\n\nand directories:\n\n- _annotation/_: directory containing the following files:\n\n  1. gene annotation file from the Ensembl database\n  2. genome sequence file from the Ensembl database\n  \n- _reads/_: directory containing the RNA-seq files to be aligned. Both FASTA and FASTQ files are allowed. If the read files are compressed, specify the uncompression command in the _params_Star.txt_ file; different compression formats are allowed, according to Star aligner  (https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf).\n\n"
