        "value": "DisoFLAG, a computational method that leverages a graph-based interaction protein language model (GiPLM) for jointly predicting disorder and its multiple potential functions. GiPLM integrates protein semantic information based on pre-trained protein language models into graph-based interaction units to enhance the correlation of the semantic representation of multiple disordered functions. The DisoFLAG predictor takes amino acid sequences as the only inputs and provides predictions of intrinsic disorder and six disordered functions for proteins, including protein-binding, DNA-binding, RNA-binding, ion-binding, lipid-binding, and flexible linker.\n\n![image](https://github.com/YihePang/DisoFLAG/blob/main/img/fig_1.png)\n\n**Figure.1** Schematic overview of DisoFLAG. **(a)** DisoFLAG provides predictions of six functions for intrinsically disordered regions in proteins. Joint prediction of the six functional regions results in a lower information entropy compared to individual prediction. The reduction in information entropy is known as information gain (IG), which reflects the correlation between different functions. High IG, strong correlation. **(b)** The graph-based interaction protein language model (GiPLM) architecture employed in DisoFLAG. The Bi-directional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) layer is used to capture the protein contextual semantic information based on the residue embeddings extracted from the pre-trained protein language model. The subsequent attention-based gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer is used to model the global correlation among sequences and produces a hidden representation for each residue. The feature mapping layers are used to generate six different function embedding vectors for each residue. Subsequently, for each residue, the graph-based interaction unit models six functions and their correlations as a functional graph, utilizing function embedding vectors as node representations and pre-calculated IG matrix as the weighted adjacency matrix for graph edges. Finally, the propensity scores for disorder and six disordered functions were calculated based on the semantic correlation features aggregated on the functional graph by the graph convolutional network (GCN) layer.\n\n"
