Deploy ScanNeo2:\n\n```\nmkdir -p /path/to/your/working/directory/\ncd /path/to/your/working/directory/\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ylab-hi/ScanNeo2.git\ncd ScanNeo2\n```\n\n3. (Optional) Install HLA-HD\n\n    ScanNeo2 employs HLA-HD for HLA Class II genotyping which is required when ScanNeo2 has been configured to predict class II neoantigens. \n    Due to license reasons it has to be installed manually (download request). Please follow the instructions on the official \n    [website](https://w3.genome.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp/HLA-HD/). ScanNeo2 has been tested using HLA-HD v1.7.0\n\n\n\n\n3. Configure ScanNeo2 by editing the `config/config.yml` file. Make sure to adjust parameters to suit your needs and data.\n"
