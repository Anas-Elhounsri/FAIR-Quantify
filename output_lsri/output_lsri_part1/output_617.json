Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an\nappointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a\nproject may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported by [contacting the project team](contact.md). All complaints will be\nreviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed\nnecessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated\nto maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further\ndetails of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good\nfaith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other\nmembers of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis code of conduct has been derived from the excellent code of conduct of the\n[ATOM project](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\nwhich in turn is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version\n1.4, available at [https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: https://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n"

The standard has *Terms* that describe characteristics of a sample that addresses: \n* What is the source of the sequence?\n* In what kind of environment was the sample collected?\n* What methods were utilized to process the sample? \nFollowing the release of MIxS v6.0, subsequent releases (e.g. MIxS 6.1) are represented in and maintained using the [LinkML](https://linkml.io/linkml/) framework. LinkML uses YAML to define schemas. The [user-focused](#repository-structure)/[developer-focused](#developer-documentation) sections of the repository structure provide details on where to find these YAML files that are defining the standard. \n*Terms* \nThe individual metadata terms are provided in the table: [here](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/term_list/). These *Terms* are attributes or properties that describe samples and their sequence-associated metadata. Broadly, MIxS metadata *Terms* are represented in genomic *Checklists*, environmental *Extensions*, and *Combinations* (of *Checklists* and *Extensions*).  \n*Checklists*\n[Checklists](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/#checklists) include the required, recommended and optional metadata fields (*Terms*) for a specific type of genomic sequence (e.g. genome, metagenome, microbiome, marker gene, MAG or single cell genome). The MIGS genomic sequences checklist, for example, supports taxa or subcellular structure specific checklists (Eukaryotes, Bacteria, Viruses, Organelle, Plants). \n*Combinations*\nMIxS Checklists and Extensions are designed to be modular, supporting mix and match combinations of any genomic checklist with terms from any environmental extension, to create MIxS [Combinations](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/combinations/). For example, a Combination of the [MIMS](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/0010007/) *Checklist* and [Agriculture](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/0016018/) *Extension*, called [MIMSAgriculture](https://genomicsstandardsconsortium.github.io/mixs/0010003_0016018/).\n \n"
