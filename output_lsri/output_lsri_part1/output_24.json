If you are new to Git and/or GitHub, please see the tutorial [A\nQuick Introduction to Version Control with Git and GitHub][intro-git-github].\n\n[intro-git-github]: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668\n\n1. Fork the repository to your personal account\n\n1. Clone your fork to your local machine\n\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/<fork>/OmicNavigator.git\n    cd OmicNavigator\n    ```\n\n1. Create a new branch. We recommend prefixing the branch name with `feature/`\nor `bugfix/` to help classify it, but don't worry about this too much.\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout -b feature/<x>\n    ```\n\n1. Make your edits. See the section below on setting up your development\nenvironment.\n\n1. Add, commit, push, and open a Pull Request against the \"main\" branch.\n\n    ```sh\n    git push origin feature/<x>\n    ```\n\n## Setup your development environment\n\nFirst install the development only packages:\n\n```R\ninstall.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"remotes\", \"roxygen2\"))\n```\n\nSecond install the required and suggested dependencies:\n\n```R\nremotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)\n```\n\nThird install LaTeX, Make, and Graphviz if you wish to re-build the\nvignettes:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install texlive texinfo make graphviz\n```\n\nIf you\u2019re on Windows or macOS, I recommend using the R package\n[tinytex](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tinytex) to install the\nminimal [TinyTex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) distribution.\n\nTo install the app for local testing, the easiest method is to install it once\nin the source directory, so that the app is always installed whenever you build\nthe package locally. You can do this by first loading the package with devtools\nand then running `installApp()`, which will install the app to `inst/www/`:\n\n```R\ndevtools::load_all()\ninstallApp()\n```\n\n## Updating NEWS.md\n\nIf your pull request affects the end user experience, please add a bullet to\n`NEWS.md`. At minimum include a reference to your pull request. Additional\nuseful information is your GitHub account and any related Issues.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n* Fix bug in `nameOfFunction()` that caused a problem with... (#12, #13, @username)\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nIf you edit the function documentation in the `.R` files, you will need to\nregenerate the corresponding `.Rd` files in `man/`.\n\n1. Update the documentation files by running `devtools::document()` in the R\nconsole or pressing Ctrl+Shift+D in RStudio\n\n1. Reinstall the package with `devtools::install()` (Ctrl+Shift+B in RStudio).\nAlternatively you could reload the package with `devtools::load_all()`\n(Ctrl+Shift+L in RStudio), but note that any links in the documentation won't\nwork if the package is only loaded\n\n1. Confirm that the function documentation has been updated by running\n`?<name-of-function>`. You may have to refresh the help pane if you already had\nit open in RStudio\n\n## Unit tests\n\nThe unit tests are in `inst/tinytest/`. They use the testing framework\n[tinytest][]. Each test file more or less corresponds to a file in `R/`, e.g.\n`testAdd.R` tests the functions in `R/add.R`. Unit tests are highly encouraged\nbut not required for pull requests.\n\n[tinytest]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=tinytest\n\nAfter you make your changes, you can run all the tests by running the following\nin the R console:\n\n```R\ntinytest::test_all()\n```\n\nFor quicker feedback, you can run one specific test file. For example, if you\nare making changes to the functions in `R/get.R`, you can run the corresponding\ntests in `inst/tinytest/testGet.R` with:\n\n```R\ntinytest::run_test_file(\"inst/tinytest/testGet.R\")\n```\n\nIf you'd like to write additional tests (highly encouraged!), try to follow the\nstyle of the surrounding code. In general, the tests are structured like below:\n\n```R\nobserved <- functionName(\n  arg1,\n  arg2\n)\n\nexpect_identical(\n  observed,\n  expected\n)\n```\n\nSome additional testing tips:\n\n* If re-installing the package is taking up too much time, you can quickly load\nthe latest versions of all the package functions into the R console by running\n`devtools::load_all(\".\")` (or Ctrl-Shift-L in RStudio).\n\n* If the messages returned by OmicNavigator functions are obscuring the test\noutput too much, you can wrap the tinytest function call with\n`suppressMessages()`. This will suppress the messages from the OmicNavigator\nfunctions but still display the test results.\n\nLastly, if you are making a large contribution, it can be helpful to evaluate\nthe comprehensiveness of your tests by calculating the test coverage. The covr\npackage runs the package tests and creates a report that details which lines\nwere executed by the tests, and most importantly, which lines were never run.\nThis will highlight any logic in your code that isn't being regularly tested.\n\n```R\ninstall.packages(\"covr\")\nlibrary(covr)\ncov <- package_coverage()\ncov\nreport(cov)\n```\n\n## GitHub Actions\n\nWe use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD. The\nconfiguration scripts are in `.github/workflows/`.\n\n* `comprehensive.yml` - Runs `R CMD check` on the R package on Windows, macOS,\nand Linux. It is triggered by a push to the \"main\" branch or a Pull Request\nsubmitted against the \"main\" branch.\n\n* `release.yml` - Creates a new release. It is triggered by a new tag. It\ndownloads the app, builds a package tarball, builds the vignettes PDFs, and\nuploads the tarball and PDFs as release assets.\n\n* `quick.yml` - Quickly runs the tests and executes the code in the vignettes.\nDesigned for quick feedback. It is triggered by a push to any branch other than\nthe \"main\" branch.\n\nIf you wish to skip all automated CI, e.g. you are trying something experimental\nthat you know will break the tests, you can put \"skip\" anywhere in the branch\nname. Also note that the continuous integrations jobs are only triggered if a\nfile that affects the behavior of the package has been modified. For example, if\nyou only edit documentation files like `README.md`, the tests won't be run.\n\n## Run OmicNavigator with Docker\n\nThe repository includes a `Dockerfile` to install and run OmicNavigator. This is\nconvenient if you want to test changes you've made to the R package without\ninstalling the dependencies on your local machine.\n\n```sh\n# Build the image\ndocker build -t omicnavigator .\n# Run the image\ndocker run --name onapp -t -p 8004:8004 omicnavigator\n```\n\nOpen the app in your browser at http://localhost:8004/ocpu/library/OmicNavigator/\n\nWhen you're finished, stop and delete the container:\n\n```sh\ndocker stop onapp\ndocker rm onapp\n```\n\n## Tag a new release\n\nFollow these steps to tag a new release:\n\n* Bump the version in `DESCRIPTION`. Make sure it only has 3 components\n(major.minor.patch)\n\n* Update `NEWS.md`. Manually add the section header `# major.minor.patch`\n\n* Commit the changes\n\n* Tag the release\n\n    ```sh\n    git tag -l -n9\n    git tag -a v#.#.# -m \"v#.#.#\"\n    ```\n\n* Push the tag to GitHub\n\n    ```sh\n    git push origin --tags\n    ```\n\n* Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow [Create a release from a\ntag][gh-actions-release]. It will create a new release, copy-paste the section\nfrom `NEWS.md` to use as the release notes, build and upload the PDF vignettes,\nand build and upload a tarball with the app pre-bundled\n\n[gh-actions-release]: https://github.com/abbvie-external/OmicNavigator/actions/workflows/release.yml\n\n## How to review and merge Pull Requests\n\nSome notes and advice on Pull Requests:\n\n* Pull Requests should be merged into the \"main\" branch\n* The GitHub Actions workflows won't be triggered by PRs from first-time\n  contributors to the repository. You'll need to check the edits they made and\n  then allow the Actions to run\n* Merge commits are disabled. Instead, you will have to decide whether to squash\n  or rebase the commits. Squashing combines all the commits into one single\n  commit. This is preferred when many small commits have been made in response\n  to feedback and failing tests. You'll have the opportunity to edit the commit\n  message to better convey the final contribution of the PR. If instead each\n  commit in the PR is a standalone change, then you can choose to rebase the\n  commits, which rewrites them on top of the \"main\" branch. Either way the\n  submitter will need to delete their feature branch and then pull the latest\n  from the official repo into their fork's \"main\" branch\n\n## How to sync the dev branch\n\nThe \"dev\" branch exists to deploy experimental (and potentially breaking)\nchanges that need to be coordinated by the backend R package and the frontend\nweb app. However, it also needs to be kept in sync with the \"main\" branch.\nOtherwise the latest changes to the R package won't be deployed to the dev\nserver.\n\nUnfortunately, [GitHub does not allow fast-forward merges of Pull\nRequests][so-no-fast-forward]. In other words, using the GitHub UI would require\nrewriting the commit SHA, and then \"main\" could no longer be cleanly merged into\n\"dev\".\n\n[so-no-fast-forward]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60597400/how-to-do-a-fast-forward-merge-on-github\n\nSo instead, a developer with write-access needs to regularly sync \"dev\" by\nrunning the following locally:\n\n```sh\n# in the local clone of their fork\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/abbvie-external/OmicNavigator.git\ngit pull upstream main\ngit checkout dev\ngit merge main\ngit push upstream dev\ngit checkout main\n```\n\n## CRAN submission\n\nRun the following additional tests prior to CRAN submission, and then update\n`cran-comments.md` accordingly.\n\n```R\ndevtools::check_win_devel()\nrhub::validate_email()\nrhub::check_for_cran(platform = \"ubuntu-gcc-devel\")\n```\n\nNext build the tarball (first delete `inst/www/` if you have the app installed\nlocally), and [submit the tarball][cran].\n\n[cran]: https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html\n\n```R\nrm -r inst/www/\nR CMD build .\n```\n\nEnter the name and email of the current package maintainer (role `cre` in\n`DESCRIPTION`). Copy-paste the contents of `cran-comments.md` into the box\n\"Optional comment\". Finally click \"Upload the package\".\n"
