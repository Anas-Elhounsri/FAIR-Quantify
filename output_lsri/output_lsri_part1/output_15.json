Check [docs](https://github.com/dmitrymyl/BaRDIC/blob/main/docs/running.md) for an example.\r\n- Added an option to not estimate scaling for all RNAs (all scaling factors will be equal 1).\r\n- q-values are now estimated both globally and within each RNA individually. User can specify which q-value type to use to control the FDR.\r\n- Due to changes in q-values, the version of the Rdc schema has been updated to 1.1.\r\n- In `selection.tsv`, numbers of zero bins are added.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixes for scaling of RNAs with zero cis contacts.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n- Performance of multiprocessing is enhanced due to scheduling jobs in chunks (modification is possible from API side). The size of a chunk is internally adjusted to balance between the number of available cores and pending jobs.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- Now only version 1.1 of Rdc will be created. Version 1 can be read, but there might be potential problems with rerunning some parts of the pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n- Added code for filtering of \"bad\" RNAs and contacts, the command will be introduced in the future.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dmitrymyl/BaRDIC/compare/v0.4.1...v.0.5.0",

With pretty help messages due to custom formatter class. Run `bardic -h` to see for yourself.\r\n- New util `run` that allows to run the whole pipeline with the single command. Also, `run` allows for supplying a custom background track (bedGraph with evenly sized bins).\r\n- Versioning of `dnah5` and `rdc` file schemas via `version` attribute. Current version is `\"1\"`.\r\n- Docs: for basic [running](https://github.com/dmitrymyl/BaRDIC/blob/main/docs/running.md) of the pipeline and [description](https://github.com/dmitrymyl/BaRDIC/blob/main/docs/schemas.md) of `rdc` and `dnah5` schemas.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n- Enforced checking of `Rdc`/`rdc` and `DnaDataset`/`dnah5` status attributes in utils. E.g., there will be no creation of `rdc` file if `are_binsizes_selected` in `dnah5` is `False`.\r\n- Removed reduntant peak estimatation once their p-values and q-values are estimated (i.e. if `Rdc.are_peaks_estimated` is `True`).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n- Changed code and namings of status attributes for `DnaDataset`/`dnah5` (`binsizes_selected` -> `are_binsizes_selected`) and `Rdc`/`rdc` (`scaling_fitted` -> `is_scaling_fitted`, `peaks_estimated` -> `are_peaks_estimated`).\r\n- Minor API changes for better code quality.\r\n- `dnah5` and `rdc` files generated with previous versions of BaRDIC won't be open with the new one due to added `version` attribute.\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n- Pipeline runs even with single RNA, so calling peaks for one-to-all data is possible now! Please ensure that the background track is a bedGraph with evenly sized bins. Parameters need to be tuned by the user, specifically for bin size selection and q-value threshold. The quality of peaks wasn't checked, though.",
