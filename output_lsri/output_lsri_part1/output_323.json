Profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) of core gene sets prepared in advance and enclosed in the package are used for homologs search by HMMER (http://hmmer.org/), and customized gene sets can also be used to build profile HMMs by EasyCGTree for homologs search. It has integrated all the steps needed between the input data and the resulted tree file into one Perl script, which would make it easier to infer a core-gene tree.\r\n\r\nHow to install EasyCGTree? \r\nAfter the downloaded package (https://github.com/zdf1987/EasyCGTree4; https://gitee.com/zdf1987/EasyCGTree4/releases) is decompressed and renamed (e.g. \u2018\u2026/Downloads/EasyCGTree\u2019 for Linux; \u2018/\u2019 should be \u2018\\\u2019 for Windows), no installation is required for EasyCGTree, beside installing Perl language environment. Other extra programs invoked by EasyCGTree had been included within the package. The following is a list of the extra programs:\r\n1) Perl (>v5.0): https://www.perl.org/ \r\n2*) HMMER (v3.0): http://hmmer.org/ \r\n3*) FastTree (>v2.0): http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Usage \r\n4*) muscle (v5): http://www.drive5.com/muscle/\r\n5*) consense (v3.698): https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html\r\n6*) IQ-TREE (>v2.0): http://www.iqtree.org/ \r\n7*) trimAl (v1.2): http://trimal.cgenomics.org/trimal?do=backlink \r\n8*) astral-weighted (v1.15.23): https://github.com/chaoszhang/ASTER/ \r\n*: a version of these software had been included in the EasyCGTree package. For Linux version. Users may need to use \u201cchmod +x filename\u201d within folder \u2018bin\u2019 to make them executable. \r\nBuild-in Profile HMM need to be downloaded separately, and then decompress them and put .hmm files into \u2018HMM\u2019 folder.\r\nExperienced users can replace the included tools with precompiled up-to-date versions easily to update EasyCGTree, and we will update these tools and the main scripts aperiodically to ensure the longevity. We will also try to develop a version on MAC OS that is as portable as those on Windows and Linux. \r\n\r\nFor the installation and usage of EasyCGTree, please refer to the Manual.\r\n\r\nThere is also a brief tutorial in the Manual.\r\n\r\n\r\n-=- Change Log 4.2 -=-\r\n1.
