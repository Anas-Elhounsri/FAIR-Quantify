A simple single-process version (one process to communicate to/from the Guppy client) that works well for HAC and SUP models is available in the `singleproc` branch for learning purposes. \n- Before v0.3.3, the main branch was the single-process version (`singleproc` branch) and the multi=process version was under the `multiproc` branch. \n"

Buttery-eel sends 1 channel per client connection, controlled by `--procs`, and in order to force the basecaller to release the data, it sends 10 \"fake\" reads to the basecaller with channel numbers >9000. This is mostly due to the poor implementation of duplex in the ONT library, so I can't really do much about that.\n- You should write duplex data out using `.sam`. This will mean you get the duplex tags, dx:i:N where N=0 is simplex, N=-1 is a parent of a duplex read, and N=1 is a duplex read.\n- There is a bug in the ONT library, where if a read is split, and two reads from that split read are parents of a duplex read, one of those parent reads won't be flagged with dx:i:-1, but dx:i:0 instead. I have told ONT and they said they will fix it (Bug present in `ont-pybasecall-client-lib v7.4.12`)\n- When duplex first starts, it sequentially reads the whole blow5 file to create the channel groups. This can take a while, so please be patient. \nI wouldn't recommend using duplex just yet because of the issues and poor performance. \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "`Albacore` (not used anymore) and `Guppy` are closed source software, and researchers are required to sign a developer agreement to gain access to the source code. Any changes made by the researchers can't share that modified software, and there are a number of restrictions in place that are too boring to talk about. \n`Bonito` and `Dorado` on the other hand, are MOSTLY open source. I say MOSTLY, because they have closed source dependencies, such as `koi`, and their license isn't really \"true\" open source. Either way, it's close enough. This is great, because any modifications a researcher makes to those software, can be shared with the wider community. \nWe have had an interest in the basecallers as we are the developers of `SLOW5`, a file format that is smaller and faster than `FAST5`. While ONT is developing `POD5`, there is a gap, where anyone using `SLOW5` for downstream analysis and storage, have to convert their `SLOW5` files back to `FAST5` to re-basecall with newer versions of `guppy`, bonito, or dorado. While we have built versions of `guppy` that can read `SLOW5`, we cannot distribute these due to developer agreement. We have built forks of both bonito and dorado and submitted pull requests on their official repositories, they were rejected by the ONT devs. \nSo there is a major road block for ease of use with `SLOW5` for re-basecalling data, especially with `guppy`, as that is the current production basecaller. I think this is something that stands in the way of more widespread adoption. While we can maintain our own forks of bonito and dorado as the changes to read `SLOW5` are minimal, there is no work around to share a `guppy` version that reads `SLOW5`....UNTIL NOW! \nAdaptive sampling has really pushed the need for interfaces with basecalling in real-time, and a python interface has been built to help control `guppy_basecaller_client` and `guppy_basecall_server`. There is an open library from ONT called `pyguppyclient`, however I had some issues getting it to work, and support seems patchy. However it uses something called `ont-pyguppy-client-lib` which is built and released with every `guppy` release, and so is up to date with the latest versions. So, if we match the python library version, with the `guppy` release version, they should be compatible. \nSo using this library and some helpful hints from the readfish/ReadUntil basecalling scripts by Matt Loose and Alexander Payne, `buttery-eel` starts a `guppy_basecall_server`, connects to it as a client, reads a `SLOW5` file to get reads, converts them to a form to be accepted by `guppy`, and sends them to the `guppy_basecall_server`. It then collects the basecalled reads, and writes the data to a fastq. Once all the reads are processed, it sends a termination command to the `guppy_basecall_server` and that's it. \nThe best thing about this, is all of the libraries and code is open, and so we can share a method that doesn't cause any legal headaches, and also doesn't require the ONT devs to accept any pull requests or code changes. This just wraps around any `guppy` release like a \"buttery eel\", and you can use `SLOW5`. \nThere is now a new python library/API for the dorado-server builds called `ont-pybasecall-client-lib`. It has replaced `ont-pyguppy-client-lib`. There are a number of breaking changes with this change, and I have done my best to handle them. Please let me know if something does work for you.\n \n"

Output will now be unaligned-sam containing the `MM/ML` tags. It will also provide the move table\n\nYou must use guppy 6.3.0 or higher for mod calling\n\n    buttery-eel -g ont-guppy-6.3.8/bin --use_tcp -x \"cuda:all\" --config dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5hmc_5mc_cg_fast.cfg --call_mods --port 5558 -i PAF25452_pass_bfdfd1d8_11.blow5 -o test.mod.sam\n\nthe `--config` file can be found using this command with guppy `guppy_basecaller --print_workflows` and looking up the appropriate kit and flowcell type. Specify the format like this `--config dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_5khz_hac.cfg` ending in `.cfg`\n\nYou can parse in any guppy/dordao flag, and buttery-eel will parse it through to the basecaller.\n\nSome common args are:\n\n- `-x/--device`: Specify CPU or GPU device: 'cpu', 'cuda:all', 'auto' or 'cuda:<device_id>[,<device_id> ...]', the default is 'cpu'. Specifying 'auto' will choose either 'cpu' or 'cuda:all' depending on the presence of a cuda device.\n- `--use_tcp`: Make connections on a tcp port instead of a Unix socket file. This flag has no effect on Windows as connections are always via tcp.\n- `-p/--port`:Port for hosting service. Specify \"auto\" to make server automatically search for a free port.\n\n"
