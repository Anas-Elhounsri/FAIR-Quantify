        "value": "**Motivation**: With the growing interest in using phages to combat antimicrobial resistance, computational methods for predicting phage-host interactions have been explored to help shortlist candidate phages. Most existing models consider entire proteomes and rely on manual feature engineering, which poses difficulty in selecting the most informative sequence properties to serve as input to the model.\n\n**Method**: In this paper, we framed phage-host interaction prediction as a multiclass classification problem that takes as input the embeddings of a phage's receptor-binding proteins, which are known to be the key machinery for host recognition, and predicts the host genus. We explored different protein language models to automatically encode these protein sequences into dense embeddings without the need for additional alignment or structural information.\n\n**Results**: We show that the use of embeddings of receptor-binding proteins presents improvements over handcrafted genomic and protein sequence features. The highest performance was obtained using the transformer-based protein language model ProtT5, resulting in a 3% to 4% increase in weighted F1 and recall scores across different prediction confidence thresholds, compared to using selected handcrafted sequence features.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/phage-host-prediction/blob/main/figure.png?raw=True\" alt=\"Teaser Figure\" width = 800>\n\n\u2191 _Return to [Table of Contents](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/phage-host-prediction?tab=readme-ov-file#table-of-contents)._\n"

Yu for sharing his environment configuration._\n\n<details>\n    <summary>Click here to show/hide note on running the notebook for protein embedding generation.\n    </summary>\n\n<br>\n\nThe notebook [`4. Protein Embedding Generation.ipynb`](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/phage-host-prediction/blob/main/experiments/4.%20Protein%20Embedding%20Generation.ipynb) has a dependency (`bio_embeddings`) that requires it to be run on Unix or a Unix-like operating system. If you are using Windows, consider using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (WSL) or a virtual machine. We did not include `bio_embeddings` in [`environment_experiments.yaml`](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/phage-host-prediction/blob/main/environment_experiments.yaml) to maintain cross-platform compatibility; you have to install it following the instructions [here](https://docs.bioembeddings.com/v0.2.3/).\n\nMoreover, generating protein embeddings should ideally be done on a machine with a GPU. The largest (and best-performing) protein language model that we used, ProtT5, consumes 5.9 GB of GPU memory. If your local machine does not have a GPU or if its GPU has insufficient memory, we recommend using a cloud GPU platform.\n\n**UPDATE (12 Jun 2023)**: In May 2023, Google Colab upgraded its Python runtime, resulting in compatibility issues with `bio_embeddings`. An alternative cloud GPU platform is Paperspace, which provides a [PyTorch 1.12 runtime](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/paperspace/notebooks/concepts/notebook-templates/) that is compatible with `bio_embeddings`.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click here to show/hide the complete list of Python libraries and modules used in this project (excluding those that are part of the

A sample FASTA file is provided [here](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/phage-host-prediction/blob/main/sample.fasta).\n-   Replace `<model_joblib>` with the path to the trained model (recognized format: joblib or compressed joblib, framework: scikit-learn). Download our trained model from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRloKMtPnp8QTOHx5IvSx_-8BspdVKNQ/view?usp=sharing). No need to uncompress, but doing so will speed up loading the model albeit at the cost of additional storage requirements. Refer to this [guide](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.dump.html) for the list of accepted compressed formats.\n-   Replace `<results_dir>` with the path to the directory to which the results of running PHIEmbed will be written. The results of running PHIEmbed on the sample FASTA file are provided [here](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/phage-host-prediction/tree/main/sample_results).\n\nThe results for each protein are written to a CSV file (without a header row). Each row contains two comma-separated values: a host genus and the corresponding prediction score (class probability). The rows are sorted in order of decreasing prediction score. Hence, the first row pertains to the top-ranked prediction.\n\nUnder the hood, this script first converts each sequence into a protein embedding using ProtT5 (the top-performing protein language model based on our experiments) and then passes the embedding to a random forest classifier trained on our entire [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1icEenU5Sv-7i9pUycaQfNC1Imhrg3sEN/view?usp=sharing). If your machine has a GPU, it will automatically be used to accelerate the protein embedding generation step.\n\n**Note:** Running this script for the first time may take a few extra minutes since it involves downloading a model (ProtT5, around 2 GB) from Hugging Face.\n"
