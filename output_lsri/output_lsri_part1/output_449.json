        "value": "To run the clustering you will need antibody models which are IMGT numbered and with chain identifier 'H' for the heavy chain and 'L' for the light chain. Models with IMGT numbering and correct chain identifiers can be obtained from a default run of <a href=\"https://github.com/brennanaba/ImmuneBuilder\">ImmuneBuilder</a>.\n\nOnce you have a directory with antibody models you can cluster them using SPACE2. We recommend using the agglomerative clustering method with an RMSD threshold of 1.25 \u00c5 and default `selection` and `anchors` parameters. This will use the length of all six CDRs to group the antibodies and RMSDs will be calculated across all six CDRs after alignment on both heavy and light chain framework regions. North CDR definitions are used by default.\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport SPACE2\n\nantibody_models = glob.glob(\"path/to/antibody/models/*.pdb\")\n\nclustered_dataframe = SPACE2.agglomerative_clustering(antibody_models, cutoff=1.25)\n```\n\nAlternatively a greedy clustering algorithm is implemented:\n\n```python\nclustered_dataframe = SPACE2.greedy_clustering(antibody_models, cutoff=1.25)\n```\n\nor a custom clustering aglorithm can be used. The clustering algorithm should be a class and follow the syntax of scikit-learn. The class must have a `self.fit(X)` method that takes a distance matrix as an input and store cluster labels in a `self.labels_` attribute.\n\n```python\nalgorithm = CustomClusteringAlgorithm(*args, **kwargs)\nclustered_dataframe = SPACE2.cluster_with_algorithm(algorithm, antibody_models)\n```\n\nCDRs considered during the initial step of grouping by length and used for the RMSD calculation can be modified with `selection` arguments. Frameworks to be used for structural alignment can be modified using the `anchor` arguments. Here, is an example of how to restict SPACE2 to only consider the length and RMSDs of heavy chain CDRs and align on the heavy chain framework.\n\n```python\nfrom SPACE2 import reg_def\n\ncdr_selection = [reg_def['CDRH1'], reg_def['CDRH2'], reg_def['CDRH3']]\nfw_selection = [reg_def['fwH']]\n\nclustered_dataframe = SPACE2.agglomerative_clustering(antibody_models, selection=cdr_selection, anchors=fw_selection, cutoff=1.25)\n```\n\nLists of residues can be passed for selection or anchors to customise the regions considered during clustering. The lists should contain the the IMGT number of each residue to include for the heavy chain and the IMGT number + 128 for the light chain. The code below provides an example of how to use CDR3 residues by IMGT region definitions.\n\n```python\nfrom SPACE2 import reg_def\n\nCDRH3 = list(range(105, 118))\nCDRL3 = [x+128 for x in CDRH3]\n\ncdr_selection = [reg_def['CDRH1'], reg_def['CDRH2'], CDRH3, reg_def['CDRL1'], reg_def['CDRL2'], CDRL3]\nfw_selection = [reg_def['fwH']]\n\nclustered_dataframe = SPACE2.agglomerative_clustering(antibody_models, selection=cdr_selection, anchors=fw_selection, cutoff=1.25)\n```\n"
