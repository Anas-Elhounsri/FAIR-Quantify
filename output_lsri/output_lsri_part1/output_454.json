Inside the root directory of the gonomics repository run this command to build a docker container of gonomics:\n```\ndocker build . -t gonomics\n```\n \n* This command takes a working directory as an input. A period is used here to indicate the current directory. Any scripts, data, or files you reference will build local paths from that directory.\n* `-t` (tag) is used to name you container. As you acculate more docker images, you can easily reference them by their assgined tags. \n* alternatively you could just set it as `$HOME/src/github.com/vertgenlab/gonomics`, but this makes more sense to me because the general convention is to create your applications at the `/app` or `/gonomics` but as a go programing building in src is how I think about it. \n3. Once we set our working directory in the container, we need to add code we wrote with `ADD . .` which takes a local directory as the first argument and the destination (inside the docker container) as the second. In other words we are recursively copying local files in gonomics into our `WORKDIR` which we set in step 2. \n* `ADD (everything in gonomics dir) to here /src/github.com/vertgenlab/` is what that means. \n"

Finally, `go install ./...` will build all gonomics executables into your $GOBIN which is located at `/go/bin` by default. \n6. Now you can basically run any gonomics cmd globally in the container:\n```\n    docker run gonomics chimpAncestorRecon -h\n```\n    * or use the containers golang compiler globally on your desktop without having to worry about setting your $GOROOT, $GOPATH, $GOBIN\n* all your gonomics dependencies should be all set up at this point\n```\n\ndocker run -v $(pwd):/mnt gonomics go run $script.go\n\n```\n \n* this command will mount your local file system into the `/mnt` directory of your container. \n"
