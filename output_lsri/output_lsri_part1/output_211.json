The program will output the CSV file for each task.\nThe input file formats and the parameter settings are listed below.\n- MS spectra\n  - mzXML format is required. To ensure the correct format, users can use MSConvert (https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/download.html) to transfer the RAW file into mzXML by choosing the <strong>peak picking</strong> and <strong>zero samples</strong> functions as well as the <strong>32-bit precision</strong> and uncheck <strong>Use zlib compression</strong>. Both MS1 and MS2 spectra need to be retained. Details of manipulation can be found in the Tutorial.pdf under the ECL-PF repo.\n- Protein sequence database\n  - FASTA format is required. It is a standardized format that you can download from https://www.uniprot.org/.\n- Threads\n  - Number of threads to run the data.\n- Peptide mass\n  - The minimum and maximum peptide mass as the restriction during the in silico protein digestion.\n- Digestion rule\n  - Enzyme to in silico digest the protein.\n- Miss cleavage\n  - Maximum missed cleaved sites allowed per peptide.\n- MS1 tolerance\n  - Precursor mass tolerance in MS1 spectra in ppm unit.\n- MS2 tolerance\n  - Fragment ions tolerance in MS2 spectra in Dalton unit (ppm unit in the cleavable module).\n- FDR setting\n  - False discovery rate setting under the target-decoy strategy.\n- Cross-linker\n  - Non-cleavable (cleavable) cross-linker selection for the specific data type. You can add, edit, or delete the cross-linker in the database. After changing the database, you need to click the <strong>update database</strong> button.\n- Modifications\n  - Fixed modifications and variable modifications for the specific data type. Typically, carbamidomethyl[C] is added for the fixed mods. and oxidation[M] is added for the variable mods. You can add, edit, or delete the modification in the database. After changing the database, you need to click the <strong>update mods.</strong> button.\n\n\nA video tutorial can be found at https://youtu.be/PpZgbi8V2xI.\n\nAnd the available testing data can be obtained from https://bioinformatics.hkust.edu.hk/Software/ECL_3.html"
