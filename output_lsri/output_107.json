It is the assembler of choice by the\n  [Human Pangenome Project][hpp] for the first batch of samples. \n* Hifiasm can purge duplications between haplotigs without relying on\n  third-party tools such as purge\\_dups. Hifiasm does not need polishing tools\n  like pilon or racon, either. This simplifies the assembly pipeline and saves\n  running time. \n* Hifiasm is fast. It can assemble a human genome in half a day and assemble a\n  ~30Gb redwood genome in three days. No genome is too large for hifiasm. \n* Hifiasm is trivial to install and easy to use. It does not required Python,\n  R or C++11 compilers, and can be compiled into a single executable. The\n  default setting works well with a variety of genomes. \n"

For this example, the\nprimary contigs are written to `NA12878.asm.bp.p_ctg.gfa`. \nSince v0.15, hifiasm also produces two sets of\npartially phased contigs at `NA12878.asm.bp.hap?.p_ctg.gfa`. This pair of files\ncan be thought to represent the two haplotypes in a diploid genome, though with\noccasional switch errors. The frequency of switches is determined by the\nheterozygosity of the input sample. \nHifiasm purges haplotig duplications by default. For inbred or homozygous\ngenomes, you may disable purging with option `-l0`. Old HiFi reads may contain\nshort adapter sequences at the ends of reads. You can specify `-z20` to trim\nboth ends of reads by 20bp. For small genomes, use `-f0` to disable the initial\nbloom filter which takes 16GB memory at the beginning. For genomes much larger\nthan human, applying `-f38` or even `-f39` is preferred to save memory on k-mer\ncounting.\n \n"

Also, contigs from different parental chromosomes are randomly mixed as\nit is just not possible to phase across chromosomes with Hi-C. \nHifiasm does not perform scaffolding for now.
