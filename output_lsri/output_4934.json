        "value": "**Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy** is a powerful tool for studying protein interactions. The **residue-level** resolution enables the study of dynamics and kinetics of individual binding steps in a multi-state equilibrium for multi-domain proteins. \n\nThis type of study is not very possible for other biophysical methods (e.g. isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, or fluorescence titration), which are  based on only a single readout of the **whole molecule**.\n\nHowever, it's often technically difficult to analyze the NMR lineshape data obtained from a titration experiment involving multi-state equilibrium for multi-domain proteins due to the following reasons:\n\n* Multi-state equilibrium involves complex math models\n* Fitting NMR lineshape data involves not only equilibrium models but also kinetic models relating with NMR lineshape theory and matrices\n* Most existing tools for fitting NMR lineshape data require full installation of MATLAB and other dependencies, lack user-friendly GUIs, require programming knowledge to edit setup scripts, and can only support the simplest 2-state binding model\n\nIn the past years, We've been studying the dynamics of Syk tandem SH2 (tSH2) domains and Syk tSH2 interactions with dp-ITAM peptides. NMR lineshape analysis was used to investigate the dynamics and kinetics of each step in the related multi-state equilibrium:\n\n> Feng C, Post CB (2016) Insights into the allosteric regulation of Syk association with receptor ITAM, a multi-state equilibrium.

        "value": "The current version of NmrLineGuru contains 6 GUIs to simulate or fit NMR lineshape data for 2-state, 3-state, and 4-state binding models. More GUIs may be added in future releases.\n\nWe provide compiled installation files for two platforms:\n\n* 64-bit version for Windows.\n* 64-bit version for Linux. Ubuntu Linux is preferred but it should also work on other Linux releases. \n\nPlease download and run the correct install file. During installation, please follow the on-screen prompts to install the software. This software requires the free MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) version 8.3 (R2014a). If your system doesn't have MCR 8.3, the installer will prompt to install it as well.\n\n**For Windows users:**\n\n+ Download and execute **<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forms.gle/pTGjZG1vS1rHyJas8\">NmrLineGuru_2.1_Windows.exe</a>**, the 64-bit version for windows.\n+ During installation, select the option to create a shortcut for NmrLineGuru on the desktop. \n+ After installation, click the shortcut to start the program.\n\n**For Linux users**:\n\n+ Download and execute **<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://forms.gle/pTGjZG1vS1rHyJas8\">NmrLineGuru_2.1_Linux.install</a>**, the 64-bit version for Linux.\n+ During installation, please keep a note of the install path for both NmrLineGuru and MCR. You can install them to anywhere you like. \n+ After installation, run the following command in a shell to start NmrLineGuru:   \n  `{NmrLineGuru_Root}/application/run_NmrLineGuru.sh  {MCR_Root}/v83`   \n  For example, you installed NmrLineGuru in */home/chao/NmrLineGuru* and MCR in */home/chao/mcr*. So the command line to start NmrLineGuru should be:   \n  `/home/chao/NmrLineGuru/application/run_NmrLineGuru.sh  /home/chao/mcr/v83`   \n  You may optionally add an alias for this command in the shell starting script. Search *Linux shell alias* for how-to.\n+ Note: the Linux version was tested on Ubuntu 18.04. If you use a different Linux release and experience problems of displaying or running the software, please try to install Ubuntu 18.04 in a physical or virtual machine and then install the software in it.  \n\n**NmrLineGuru on NMRbox**:\n\n+ `NmrLineGuru` is pre-installed on all NMRbox virtual machines (see <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nmrbox.org\">nmrbox.org</a>). Once you are connected to a NMRbox virtual machine, you can simply open a Linux terminal window and type  command **NmrLineGuru** to run `NmrLineGuru`.  \n+ You can either connect to a cloud-based NMRbox virtual machine via remote desktop, or download the virtual machine file and run it locally. Please check <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nmrbox.org\">nmrbox.org</a> for more details.\n"
