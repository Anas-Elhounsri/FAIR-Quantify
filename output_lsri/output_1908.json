        "value": "**IsoSplitter** is a de novo identification tool of alternative splicing sites using long-reads transcriptome without a reference genome. IsoSplitter consists of two steps of analyses that are executed by IsoSplittingAnchor.py and ShortReadsAligner.py. The latter analysis is optional, which takes short reads of transcriptome sequencing to evaluate the splicing sites predicted by IsoSplittingAnchor.py.  \n \n**IsoSplittingAnchor.py** invokes the SIM4 alignment algorithms (Florea et al. 1998) to find splitting sites derived from the whole long-read transcriptome. The first output file-named as Breakingpoint_out-is a tabular text containing the sequencing ID and the location of splicing sites. The second output file-named as GeneCluster-is the results of sequence IDs that are transcript isoforms, and each cluster is a potential gene locus for alternative splicing isoforms. The third output file-Sim4_align_out.txt-is the alignments generated by SIM4.  \n\n**ShortReadsAligner.py** is used to evaluate the splitting sites by counting the eligible breaking points. This step analysis a short-read RNA sequencing dataset to find the \u201cjunction reads\u201d-reads partially mapped next to the breaking sites and exclusively split at the same location, and count the numbers of junction reads for each breaking sites. In order to reveal the tissue-specific expression of isoforms, we provide a method to determine the expression levels of isoforms based on isoform-specific reads: Average Counts per Million of total reads (ACM). For an isoform with multiple split sites, the ACM is calculated as an average number of isoform-specific reads normalized to millions of total used reads. The ACM is defined by as following: ACM=\uff08total isoform-specific reads of a transcript/split sites of the transcript\uff09\\*\uff08total mapped reads to this transcript/transcript base number\uff09\\*10<sup>-6</sup>. \n\n**Citation**  \nIf you use IsoSplitter in your work, please cite this:  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wang Y, Hu Z, Ye N, Yin H.

IsoSplitter's running platform is UNIX. Python3.5+ is required in your environment. You also need to install the PIP function corresponding to your Python version. \n\n2. Setuptools is generally installed in python by default. If you meet the error like *\"ImportError: No module named 'setuptools'\"* during the installation of IsoSplitter, you can reinstall the latest setuptools by typing in the console:  \n`$ pip install setuptools`\n\n3. Sim4 is required for IsoSplittingAnchor.py. It is freely accessible from <http://globin.cse.psu.edu/html/docs/sim4.html> (Florea et al. 1998). The following provides a succinct way of installing SIM4. \n  * Unpack the downloaded files.  \n    `$ tar -zxvf sim4.tar.gz`\n  * The tar file will unpack into a directory named sim4.[some-date]. (You'll see what the precise name is while tar is unpacking.)  \n    `$ cd sim4.*`\n  * Compile and you may get some warnings from the compiler.  \n    `$ make`\n  * The executable will be named *\"sim4\"*, then copy it to your bin directory like this:  `$ cp sim4 /usr/local/bin/sim4`.  \n    You can check the installation by typing: `$ sim4 \u2013h`\n\n4. *\"bowtie2-build\"* and *\"bowtie2\"* are used in ShortReadsAligner.py. Bowtie2-build is a part of Bowtie2 and free from <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml>. The installation detail can be found at <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml>. You also need to copy *\"bowtie2-build\"* and *\"bowtie2\"* to your bin directory.\n"
