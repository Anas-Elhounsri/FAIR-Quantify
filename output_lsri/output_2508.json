With the accumulation of high-throughput sequencing data in public databases, the big size of available tumor samples introduces new challenges to identify competing triplets. Here, we present a novel method, called LncMiM, to identify the competing triplets for large-scale expression data of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA. In LncMiM, non-linear correlation analysis is used to cover the problem of weak correlations between miRNA-target pairs, which is due to the difference in the magnitude of the expression level. In addition, besides the miRNA, the impact of lncRNA and mRNA on the interactions in triplets are also considered to improve the identification sensitivity of LncMiM without reducing its accuracy.

In LncMiM, non-linear correlation analysis is used to cover the problem of weak correlations between miRNA-target pairs, which is due to the difference in the magnitude of the expression level. In addition, besides the miRNA, the impact of lncRNA and mRNA on the interactions in triplets are also considered to improve the identification sensitivity of LncMiM without reducing its accuracy.
