Total probability of discrimination Power (TDP) is a comprehensive capability appraisal index used to identify individual by multiple loci. In order to compare the calculation results of the three methods and TDP, we developed the software called \"VDPtools\", which can calculate the values of TDP, P-VDP, C-VDP and R-VDP.\n"

The data structure supported by the data file includes two types: loci in rows and samples in columns, or samples in rows and loci in columns. For the specific format, please refer to the two demo files \"SSR data (row-samples col-loci) .csv\" and \"SNP data (row-loci col-sample) .csv\" provided by this project.\n\nIn the locus file, loci combinations are in rows, and loci are in columns. The first column represents the sequence number of the locus combination, and the second column represents the specific locus contained in the locus combination. It is represented by the serial number of the locus in the data file. The sequence number of the locus starts from 0, and 0 represents the first locus.\n"
