Overall, we empirically find that if the RNA-seq library is good, P1 and P2 should yield very similar estimates. Therefore, if using paired-end RNA-seq data, we recommend calculating the mean between both pairs.\n \n > 2) Does TeXP work for unstranded data?\n \n Yes!\n\n> 3) Can I use other aligners\n\nOn (figure 15) [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?type=supplementary&id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007293.s015] we show that aligners do not drastically change TeXP estimations, therefore, while you could use other aligners, we suggest using bowtie2 since all TeXP parameterization has been done on bowtie2\n"
