This has now been corrected. We would like to thank Payal Arora, a graduate student in the Kaplan lab here at UPitt, for here help identifying this issue and for graciously offering us her solution to the problem so that we could update MutantHuntWGS to ensure others did not experience this same issue.** \n**2. The aligner has the capability to use multiple processors and was set to the maximum number under the assumption that it would default to the max that was available, but we believe that under these conditions it is actually defaulting to the mininmum. Therefore, we created an option for number of processors/threads -t that can be set to an integer value to specify how many processors to use. This should speed up the analysis. On your average laptop you will only be able to set it to 4 at max and we reccomend only setting it to 3.**\n \n"

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.**\n\n   * Single end sequencing FASTQ file should be named: FILENAME.fastq.gz\n\n   * Paired end sequencing FASTQ files should be named: FILENAME_R1.fastq.gz and FILENAME_R2.fastq.gz\n\n   * I suggest making copies of your FASTQ files rather then renaming the originals in case a mistake is made during the renaming process.\n\n   * For this naming example \"FILENAME\" will be used as the input for the -n option below. \n\n   * \"FILENAME\" should not have any spaces or punctuation, not even underscores.\n\n**4.

Create a directory (a folder) in a directory of your choice (on your Desktop is fine) named `./Analysis_Directory`. Within `./Analysis_Directory` create a file directory named `./FASTQ` inside of `./Analysis_Directory` and place all FASTQ files into it (full path: `./PATH_TO_DESKTOP/Analysis_Directory/FASTQ`).**\n\n**3. Ensure that FASTQ files are gzipped (can run `gzip FILENAME.fastq` to generate `FILENAME.fastq.gz`) and adhere to the naming convention described below and that all gzipped FASTQ files (fastq.gz) are placed into the FASTQ folder that you created in Step 2. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.**\n\n   * Single end sequencing FASTQ file should be named: FILENAME.fastq.gz\n\n   * Paired end sequencing FASTQ files should be named: FILENAME_R1.fastq.gz and FILENAME_R2.fastq.gz\n\n   * I suggest making copies of your FASTQ files rather then renaming the originals in case a mistake is made during the renaming process.\n\n   * For this naming example \"FILENAME\" will be used as the input for the -n option below. \n\n   * \"FILENAME\" should not have any spaces or punctuation, not even underscores.\n\n**4. Open the Terminal and download and run the Docker container for MutantHuntWGS by copying and pasting the following command into the terminal:**\n\n```\ndocker run -it -v /PATH_TO_DESKTOP/Analysis_Directory:/Main/Analysis_Directory mellison/mutant_hunt_wgs:version1\n```\n\n**5. Run MutantHuntWGS by running the code below to test.**\n```\nMutantHuntWGS.sh \\\n    -n wttoy \\\n    -g /Main/MutantHuntWGS/S_cerevisiae_Bowtie2_Index_and_FASTA/genome \\\n    -f /Main/MutantHuntWGS/S_cerevisiae_Bowtie2_Index_and_FASTA/genome.fa \\\n    -r single \\\n    -s 0 \\\n    -p /Main/MutantHuntWGS/S_cerevisiae_Bowtie2_Index_and_FASTA/ploidy_n1.txt \\\n    -d /Main/MutantHuntWGS/FASTQ_test \\\n    -o /Main/Analysis_Directory/test_output \\\n    -a YES\n```\n"
