Both counts of total allele reads and counts of alternative allele reads for each cell $c$ at mutation position $g$ are collected. In the next step, a cell-to-cell genetic divergence matrix is calculated using a genetic divergence evaluation function. DENDRO further clusters the cells and pools cells from same cluster together and re-estimate SNA profiles. Based on the re-estimated SNA profiles, DENDRO generates a parsimony tree which shows the evolution relationship between subclones.\n \n"
