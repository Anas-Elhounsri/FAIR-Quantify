The method has the ability to identify viral contigs with short length (<500bp) from metagenomic data.\n\nThe prediction model is a deep learning based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that learns the high-level features of each contig to distinguish virus from host sequences. The model was trained using equal number of known viral and host sequences from NCBI RefSeq database. Before training, those known sequences were firstly split into a number of non-overlapping contigs with a length of 500bp and then were encoded by transforming (A, T, G, C) to (1, 2, 3, 4), respectively.  For a query sequence shorter than 500bp, it should be first zero-padded up to 500bp. Then the sequence is predicted by the RNN model trained with previously known sequences.\n"

Or you can make some changes to the hyperparameters, and then retrain the model.\n* Using users' own database in a \".csv\" format. <br>\n\t* Firstly, chose a set of hyperparameters to train your dataset.\n\t* Secondly, train and refine your model using your dataset according to the performance on a related validation dataset.\n\t* Finally, utilize the saved well trained model to identify query contigs. \nNote: Before training, set the path to where the database is located. All labels should be encoded to one-hot labels.\n\nTo make a prediction, users' own query contigs should be edited into a \".csv\" file, where every line contains a single query contig. Through `test.py`, RNN-VirSeeker will give a set of scores to each query contig, higher of which represents its classification result.\n"
