GeneWalk determines an adjusted p-value with Benjamini Hochberg FDR \ncorrection for multiple testing of all connected GO term for each \nnreps_graph repeat analysis. The value presented here is the average (mean \nestimate) over all p-adjust values from all nreps_graph repeat analyses. \n- **gene_padj** - FDR adjusted p-value of the similarity between gene and \nGO term, when correcting for multiple testing over all GO annotations of \nthat gene. This the key statistic when investigating the functions of one \n(or a few) pre-defined gene(s) of interest. Gene_padj determines the statistical \nsignificance of each GO annotation (function) and gene_padj can be used to \nsensitively rank GO annotations to reflect the relevance to the gene of interest\nin the particular biological context or tested condition. When you consider all\n(or many) input genes simultaneously, use global_padj instead. Average \nover nreps_graph repeat runs as for global_padj. \n- pval - p-value of gene - GO term similarity, not corrected for multiple\nhypothesis testing. Average over nreps_graph repeat runs.\n- sim - gene - GO term (cosine) similarity, average over nreps_graph repeat runs.\n- sem_sim - standard error on sim (mean estimate).\n- cilow_global_padj - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on global_padj \n(mean estimate) from the nreps_graph repeat analyses.\n- ciupp_global_padj - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on global_padj.\n- cilow_gene_padj - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on gene_padj\n(mean estimate) from the nreps_graph repeat analyses.\n- ciupp_gene_padj - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on gene_padj.\n- cilow_pval - lower bound of 95% confidence interval on pval (mean estimate)\nfrom the nreps_graph repeat analyses.\n- ciupp_pval - upper bound of 95% confidence interval on pval.\n- mgi_id, rgd_id, ensembl_id, entrez_human or entrez_mouse - in case one of\n  these gene identifiers were provided as input, the GeneWalk results table\n  starts with an additional column to indicate the gene identifiers. In the\n  case of mouse genes, the corresponding hgnc_id and hgnc_symbol resemble its\n  human ortholog gene used for the GeneWalk analysis.\n\n"

Each row of the SIF text file consists of \nthree comma-separated entries representing source, relation type, and target.\nThe relation type is not explicitly used by GeneWalk, and can be set\nto an arbitrary label. \nThe difference between the `sif`, `sif_annot`, and `sif_full` options:\n- `sif`: the input SIF can contain only *human* gene-gene relations. \n   Genes have to be encoded as human HGNC gene symbols (for example KRAS).\n   GO annotations for genes, as well as ontology relations \n   between GO terms are added automatically by GeneWalk. \n- `sif_annot`: the input SIF has to contain both\n  gene-gene relations, and GO annotations for genes: rows where the\n  source is a gene, and the target is a GO term. Use GO IDs with prefix \n  (for example GO:0000186) to encode GO terms.

GeneWalk does not add any more edges to the network. Encode genes and\n  GO terms in the same manner as for `sif_annot`. \nThe `edge_list` option is a simplified version of the `sif` option. It requires \na network text file that contains rows with two columns each, a source and a target. \nIn other words, it omits the relation type column from the SIF format. Further file \npreparation requirements are the same as for the `sif` option. \nThe `indra` option requires as custom network input file a Python pickle file \ncontaining a list of INDRA Statements. These statements can represent human gene-gene, \nas well as gene-GO relations from which network edges are derived. Human GO \nannotations and ontology relations between GO terms are then added automatically \nby GeneWalk during network construction. \n"

        "description": "- Increased support for alternative organisms:\r\n- Rat as an organism is now fully automated, similar to GeneWalk for mouse. We allow rat gene identifiers as input gene list with `--id_type rgd_id`. Rat gene ids are then automatically mapped to human ortholog genes with subsequent automated network assembly.\r\n- For organisms other than human, mouse and rat, we now allow custom gene ids with `--id_type custom`: these gene ids are not attempted to be mapped to human orthologs. So the columns hgnc_symbol and hgnc_id are not applicable in the genewalk_results.csv output file and thus not included with `--id_type custom`. When genewalk is run with this option, it requires as additional input a user-provided network file specified with `--network_file` and `--network_source`. \r\n- More options and support for `--network_source`: `edge_list, sif, sif_annot`, or `sif_full` to enable full network assembly when the end user either provides a gene network, gene + GO annotation networks or a full GeneWalk network (gene-gene interactions, GO annotations + GO ontology relations) as input network file in SIF or edge list format. See the README section Custom input networks for full details and which to options to use for other organisms.\r\n- Bug fix: we now include in the genewalk_results.csv output genes without GO annotations. By default, this results file contains all (properly recognized) input genes. See the perform_statistics.GeneWalk class description for the reasons on the fringe cases that input genes could not be included in the results file.\r\n- Download resource files only when needed, instead of previously all in advance.\r\n- Remove INDRA as a default install dependency: INDRA can be separately installed when it is needed in case of using option `--network_source indra`\r\n- Automated gene mapping is now done within genewalk through a stand alone GeneMapper instead of previous INDRA hgnc_client calling.\r\n- Added automated testing for the run options that require a specified `--network_file` and `--id_type rgd_id` or `custom`.",

Assembling a GeneWalk network and learning node vector representations\nby running DeepWalk on this network, for a specified number of repeats.\nTypical run time: one to a few hours.\n2. Learning random node vector representations by running DeepWalk on a set of\nrandomized versions of the GeneWalk network, for a specified number of\nrepeats. Typical run time: one to a few hours.\n3. Calculating statistics of similarities between genes and GO terms, and\noutputting  the GeneWalk results in a table. Typical run time: a few minutes.\n4. Visualization of the GeneWalk results generated in the project/figures subfolder.\nTypical run time: 1-10 mins depending on the number of input genes.\n\nGeneWalk can either be run once to complete all these stages (default), or\ncalled separately for each stage (optional argument: stage).  Recommended\nmemory availability on your operating system: 16Gb or 32Gb RAM.  GeneWalk\noutputs the uncertainty (95% confidence intervals) of the similarity\nsignificance (global and gene p-adjust). Depending on the context-specific network\ntopology, this uncertainty can be large for individual gene - function\nassociations. However, if overall the uncertainties turn out very large, one\ncan set the optional arguments nreps_graph to 10 (or more) and nreps_null to 10\nto increase the algorithm's precision. This comes at the cost of an increased\nrun time.\n\n"
