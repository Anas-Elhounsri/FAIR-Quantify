We actively welcome your pull requests:\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes.\n5. Make sure your code lints.\n6.

Spacemake is designed to handle all major spatial transcriptomics datasets and can be readily configured for other technologies. It can process and analyze several samples in parallel, even if they stem from different experimental methods. Spacemake's unified framework enables reproducible data processing from raw sequencing data to automatically generated downstream analysis reports. Spacemake is built with a modular design and offers additional functionality such as sample merging, saturation analysis, and analysis of long reads as separate modules. \nIf you find Spacemake useful in your work, consider citing it: \n```\nSpacemake: processing and analysis of large-scale spatial transcriptomics data\nTamas Ryszard Sztanka-Toth, Marvin Jens, Nikos Karaiskos, Nikolaus Rajewsky\nGigaScience, Volume 11, 2022, giac064\n```\n \n"
