(An obvious exception is\npathogen-host coevolution, however it is not expected to weigh much in\ntuberculosis-human interactions over moderately short timescales) \nThe 3 parameters of a THD analysis are the timescale, the no. of markers\n`m` and the substitution rate per marker `mu`. We use two timescales, a\nshort-term timescale of 20y and a long-term timescale of 200y.\nParameters `m` and `mu` are adapted to the minisatellites used for\ngenotyping. \nThe distribution of short-term THDs is highly skewed. Most individuals\nhave values near zero, denoting sporadic cases, while higher values\ndenote isolates in recent clusters. Before we move on to the linear\nmodelling step, it can be helpful to apply a transformation to reduce\nskewness. A simple but effective transformation is to obtain Z-scores\nafter taking logs (log-Z transform).

We examine two working\nhypothese to illustrate THD modelling: \n-   sputum smear positivity (`afb`) drives short-term success\n    independent of TB population structure, because this feature depends\n    more on patient status (delayed treatment, immune impairment, etc)\n    than pathogen features; \n-   pulmonary infection (`lung`) also drives success because\n    extrapulmonary disease is less transmissible, but this feature\n    depends more on the population structure because various TB lineages\n    exhibit differences in their ability to cause active pulmonary\n    disease. \nUnder these hypotheses, the association of `afb` with THD should be\nstronger using the shorter 20y timescale compared with the longer 200y\ntimescale. This association should not be solely explained by population\nstructure if it is host-related. Conversely, the association of `lung`\nwith THD, which is expected to be pathogen-dependent and vertically\ninherited, should be stronger using the 200y timescale and should also\ndepend on population structure. \nExamine the distribution of THDs depending on the timescale, sputum\nsmear positivity and pulmonary infection. \nVisual inspection suggests that, as expected, both pulmonary disease and\nsputum smear positivity correlate with success. The amplitudes of\ndifference are weak, with the smallest difference found for smear\npositivity and a long-term THD. This observation supports the working\nhypotheses because if smear positivity depends more on the host than on\nthe pathogen, then its association with long-term THD should be weak\nwhen the influence of the host is diluted over long time frames. \nWe will now use linear modelling to examine the strength of associations\nand their dependency on population structure. Recall that by design, THD\nis highly dependent on population structure because it directly reflects\nthis structure, so it is desirable to control for this effect.\n \n"

This function computes a set of principal\ncoordinates (PCs) significantly associated with the provided THD values.\nIncluding these PCs as covariates of a linear model provides a means to\ncontrol for population structure using the same data that were used to\ncompute THD. \n(More sophisticated methods exist to adjust for population structure,\nincluding phylogenetic generalized least squares and mixed-effect\nmodels. The `thd.adjust` method, in line with the philosophy of the\n`thd` approach, puts emphasis on simplicity; it does not require\nphylogenetic reconstruction nor additional packages. See [Price et al.\nNat Genet\n2006](http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/teaching/misc/2008.140.668/papers/price2006.pdf)\nand [Li & Yu.

These adjustement sets will help determine whether\nassociations with THD are structure-dependent: \n-   An association is structure-dependent if its significance decreases\n    after inclusion of the adjustment set in the model. Structure\n    dependency indicates that the association is explained by the\n    population structure; in the case of a pathogen such as TB, this\n    suggests that the predictor depends on the pathogen itself and\n    evolves with the pathogen with little evolutionary convergence. \n-   A structure-independent association retains its significance after\n    correction for population structure. This suggests either that the\n    predictor depends on the host rather than on the pathogen or that\n    the predictor is a pathogen feature that evolves independent of the\n    pathogen structure - this latter case may indicate evolutionary\n    convergence of the feature, which supports a causal effect.\n \n"
