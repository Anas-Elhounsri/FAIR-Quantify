Documentation includes\nthe examples and tutorials, as well as the Python docstrings to make \nsure they correspond to the current function/method signatures. If you \nfind a mistake or want to make an addition, \n[submit a pull request](#submitting-a-pull-request) with the \ncorrection/addition. \n\nBeyond documentation, the most accessible path to start contributing to \nFlowKit is to peruse the many TODO comments in the codebase. We use the \n[PEP 350](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0350/) code tags to mark \nitems that need addressing. Often times, the issues marked TODO are\nrelatively straight-forward compared to the \n[GitHub issues](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit/issues) assigned to \nupcoming milestones. For example, a TODO item might mark code that should\nbe moved to a more appropriate class or module; or, a function/method \nthat needs updating to support an additional keyword option. \n\nIf you are considering contributing code, please submit an issue letting \nus know. Due to the complexity of flow cytometry analysis, we can likely\nprovide some valuable context prior to tackling an issue.\n\n## Suggesting a feature\n\nWe cannot think of everything. If you have a good idea for a feature, \nthen please let us know!\n\nFeature suggestions are embraced, but are not guaranteed to be \nincorporated. If your suggestion is accepted, it might not be \nimplemented in the next release. This is especially true for features \nthat break the current version's API. Your patience is appreciated, we\ndo not want to break other users' code. \n\nWhen suggesting a feature, make sure to:\n\n* Check existing issues, open and closed, to make sure it has not \nalready been suggested.\n* Consider if it is necessary in the library, or is an example of \nhow the FlowKit library can be used. FlowKit is meant as a toolkit for\nflow analysis, and not a comprehensive collection of analysis \ntechniques. For these cases, consider adding the request as part of \nour collection of examples and tutorials.\n\n## Filing a bug report\n\nIf you are seeing errors or unexpected behavior with FlowKit, then \nplease submit an issue to let us know. Be as detailed as possible, and \nbe ready to answer questions when we get back to you. Make sure to \ninclude the following in your bug report:\n\n* Operating system & version/distribution (e.g., Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04)\n* Python version (e.g., 3.7)\n* FlowKit version\n* The complete traceback of the error you are seeing\n* and any solutions you have tried\n* And a paste/picture of the complete output from the failing \nscript/library might help, too!\n\n## Submitting a pull request\n\nIf you decide to fix a bug, even something as small as a \nsingle-letter typo, then great! Anything that improves the \ncode/documentation for all future users is warmly welcomed.\n\nIf you decide to work on a requested feature, it is best to let us \n(and everyone else) know what you are working on to avoid any \nduplication of effort. You can do this by replying to the original \nIssue for the request.\n\nIf you want to contribute an example; go for it! We might not always \nbe able to accept your code, but there is a lot to be learned from \ntrying anyway and if you are new to GitHub, we are willing to guide you \non that journey.\n\nWhen contributing a new example or making a change to the code, please \nkeep your code style consistent with ours. We try to stick to the PEP-8 \nguidelines for Python (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n\nFinally, make sure all the tests pass before submitting your pull request!\nNo submitted code will be reviewed if there are failing tests. The \ncomplete test suite is run using the `run_tests.py` script found at the\nroot level of the repository. For code changes that result in a failing \ntest that you cannot solve, submit or reply to an issue with a \ndescription of the problem. If you create a new function or method, \nplease write new tests with coverage for all new code. \n\n#### Do\n\n* Do use PEP-8 style guidelines\n* Do verify that all tests pass\n* Do write new tests for new functions/methods\n* Do comment your code where necessary or appropriate\n* Do submit only a single example/feature per pull-request\n* Do include a description of what your example is expected to do\n\n#### Do not\n\n* Do not include any license information in your examples - our \nrepositories are BSD licensed\n* Do not try to do too much at once, submit one or two examples at a \ntime, and be receptive to feedback\n* Do not submit multiple variations of the same example, demonstrate \none thing concisely\n\n### If you are submitting an example\n\nTry to do one thing, and do it concisely. Keep it simple. Do not mix \ntoo many ideas.\n\nThe ideal example should:\n\n* demonstrate one idea, technique or API as concisely as possible in a \nsingle Python script\n* *just work* when you run it. Although, sometimes configuration is \nnecessary\n* be well commented and attempt to teach the user how and why it works\n* document any required configuration, dependencies, etc\n\n### Licensing\n\nWhen you submit code to our libraries, you implicitly and irrevocably \nagree to adopt the associated licenses, found in the file named `LICENSE`.\n\nWe use the BSD license; which permits Commercial Use, \nModification, Distribution and Private use of our code, and therefore \nalso your contributions. It also provides good compatibility with \nother licenses, and is intended to make re-use of our code as painless \nas possible for all parties.\n\nYou can learn more about BSD licenses at Wikipedia: \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses\n\n### Submitting your code\n\nOnce you are ready to share your contribution with us you should submit \nit as a Pull Request.\n\n* Be ready to receive and embrace constructive feedback.\n* Be prepared for rejection; we cannot always accept contributions. If \nyou are unsure, ask first!\n"

        "description": "Hey FlowKit community! Lots of changes in this release, including support for Python 3.11 & 3.12. The major updates: we've moved to a `src` based structure using `pyproject.toml` and finally converted all plotting functions to Bokeh (dropping matplotlib and Seaborn as requirements). Read the notes below for all the changes.\r\n\r\n**Special thanks to @hbhargava7 and @laserson for their contributions to this release!**\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n\r\n* New utility function `read_multi_dataset_fcs` for reading FCS files with multiple data sets (returns a list of Sample instances).\r\n* `Workspace` class now has an option to load FCS files from the URI parameter embedded in the WSP file (Many thanks to @hbhargava7 for PR #168).\r\n* `Sample.plot_scatter_matrix` now displays histograms along the diagonal (Thanks @laserson for the suggestion in #169).\r\n* Exporting FlowJo 10 workspaces now supports the `WSPBiexTransform`.\r\n* `Sample.plot_scatter` adds `event_mask` option to filter the plotted events.\r\n* `Sample.plot_contours` & `Sample.plot_channel` methods now use Bokeh.\r\n* Custom heatmap color palette was improved (it's subtle but has better visual contrast between density levels).\r\n\r\nAPI changes:\r\n\r\n* `Sample.plot_histogram` method adds `data_min`, `data_max`, and `x_range` kwargs for filtering data ranges and controlling the view range.\r\n* Removed argument `ignore_transforms` in `parse_wsp` utility function.\r\n* Transforms from a GatingML document are no longer imported as undocumented \"GML\" sub-classes, instead using the documented `Transform` sub-classes.\r\n* Added kwarg `gate_path` to `plot_scatter` method in both Session & Workspace.\r\n* `sample_id` argument now required for `GatingStrategy.is_custom_gate` method.\r\n* Rename `plot_scatter` argument `highlight_indices` to `highlight_mask` (since it takes a Boolean array and not a list of indices).\r\n* `plot_scatter` argument `dim_ids` split to `x_label` & `y_label` for specifying axis labels.\r\n* `plot_gate` argument `dim_ids` split to `x_label` & `y_label` for specifying axis labels.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* Fixed KeyError in `Workspace.summary` method when a sample has no gates (see #155).\r\n* Fixed WSP export of \"range\" `RectangleGate` instances (see #157).\r\n* Fix `ValueError` thrown when compensating a Sample specifying null channels via `null_channel_list` (see #175).\r\n* Fix `Session.plot_scatter` method where mixed compensations are specified for x & y channels (rare).\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\n* Switched to ReadTheDocs theme for documentation.\r\n* Clarify docstrings for null channel usage (see Sample & Matrix constructor docs).\r\n* All notebooks validated and updated for the new release.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n\r\n* Dropped support for Python 3.7, added support for Python 3.11 & 3.12.\r\n* FlowIO updated to >=1.3.0,<1.4\r\n* FlowUtils updated to >=1.1.0,<1.2\r\n* Matplotlib & Seaborn removed as dependencies. All plotting now uses the Bokeh library (>=3.1).\r\n* Pandas updated to >=2.0\r\n* Added new dependency contourpy (the library matplotlib uses).\r\n* Other dependency minimum versions updated for Python 3.8 - 3.12 support (See requirements.txt for details).\r\n",

        "description": "Version 1.0.0 is a major milestone for the FlowKit project. This release adds support for custom sample gates in FlowJo 10 workspaces. As a major release, this version has significant API changes. Please read the release notes below and review the documentation for all the API changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n  * New dedicated Workspace class for importing FlowJo 10 workspaces. This class is essentially a read-only class for easily importing & extracting gating information from .wsp files. \r\n  * Importing .wsp files now supports 'eventsInside' flag for FlowJo gates (see #135)\r\n  * Session & GatingStrategy classes now support custom gates by specifying a `sample_id` when adding a gate to the gate tree.\r\n  * Session & GatingStrategy classes now support removing gates from the gate tree via a new `remove_gate` method. The method includes an option to retain downstream (descendant) gates.\r\n  * Sample class adds method `get_index_sorted_locations` for FACs Diva index sorted files (see #112)\r\n  * Sample class adds `id` attribute, allowing identification of samples created from NumPy arrays or pandas DataFrames.\r\n  * Sample class supports sorting (samples will be sorted by `id` attribute)\r\n  * Sample class constructor supports new arguments for controlling behavior in cases where there is a discrepancy in the data offset location (see #136)\r\n  * Sample method `plot_scatter` adds `highlight_indices` option for highlighting events using a Boolean array.\r\n  * Transform classes now support comparison for determining if 2 transforms are equivalent (i.e. have the same parameters).\r\n\r\nRemoved features:\r\n\r\n  * Removed `calculate_compensation_from_beads`, the function was moved to the flowkit_extras package (see #123)\r\n  * Session class no longer imports FlowJo 10 workspaces, this functionality now lives in the dedicated Workspace class\r\n  * Session class no longer uses sample groups, simplifying the API. Sample groups were needed for FlowJo workspaces.\r\n  \r\nAPI changes:\r\n\r\n  * New `exceptions` module containing custom FlowKit exceptions and warnings. This module also imports FlowIO exceptions so users can import all of them from one source.\r\n  * Session method `get_group_samples` was removed. `group_name` option removed from all Session methods.\r\n  * Session and GatingStrategy method `get_child_gates` was removed. A new method `get_child_gate_ids` was added. Gate instances are only available via `get_gate`.\r\n  * Session and GatingStrategy method `get_parent_gate` was removed. A new method `get_parent_gate_id` was added. Gate instances are only available via `get_gate`.\r\n  * GatingStrategy now has a `is_custom_gate` method for determining whether a Gate ID, Sample ID combination has a custom gate or the template gate.\r\n  * Session & Sample `plot_scatter` methods now take an optional `bin_width` argument to control the smoothness of the color density\r\n  * Gate classes no longer take the `parent_gate_name` argument. Gate relationships are handled completely by the GatingStrategy class.\r\n  * Gate classes have a new `get_dimension_ids` for retrieving Dimension IDs.\r\n  * Vertex class was removed. PolygonGate vertices are now just tuples of floats.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n  * Fix sample export of `orig` data for FCS files with data type int\r\n  * Fixed case where adding gates directly under QuadrantGate was possible. Adding a child gate to a QuadrantGate directly is not allowed, they must be added a one of the Quadrant instances.\r\n  * Fix parsing of FlowJo workspaces where a sample has no gate data.\r\n  * Fixed color density in scatter plots to correct missing 1st bin & poor coloring for data sets with outliers (see #139)\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n  * Docstring for Sample method `subsample_events` corrected to reflect that the method does not return anything (see #129)\r\n  * Top-level functions & exceptions were added to the documentation\r\n  * All tutorial & advanced notebooks were updated for compatibility with the new API.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n  * FlowIO requirement updated to 1.1.1\r\n  * Removed statsmodels dependency (see #123)\r\n  * Other dependency minimum versions updated for Python 3.7 - 3.10 support (See requirements.txt for details)\r\n",
