Also, remember that the PHRED to probability conversion is not linear, so most scores are relatively high. It's also not uncommon to see the PHRED score `!`, which is zero, but in this context, it means less than `\"` (PHRED = 1, P = .20567).\n\nAgain, these scores are not meant to be interpreted as regular scores and should not be processed by downstream applications expecting PHRED scores from Illumina sequences.\n"
