Why might you choose H5Glance? \n- Practical terminal interface: if you're working in a terminal, it's much\n  quicker to use something there than to start a GUI application and click\n  through it. \n  - Tab completions are part of this - take a moment to set them up (see above). \n- Static Jupyter views: H5Glance shows your HDF5 objects in simple HTML, which\n  doesn't talk to the server. Export your notebook to HTML, or `view it on\n  nbviewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/European-XFEL/h5glance/blob/master/Demo.ipynb>`_,\n  and the H5Glance view is still there.\n- Deeply nested structure: It was written at `European XFEL <https://www.xfel.eu/>`_,\n  where data files can easily have 6 layers of nested groups. It tries to make\n  working with that easy. \n- Viewing data: The terminal interface can show raw data, but it focuses on the\n  structure of HDF5 files, not their content. H5Glance won't show you plots or\n  images.\n- Machine-readable output: It's meant for people, not programs.\n  In Python, your code can use `h5py <https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/>`_.\n  For shell pipelines, use tools like ``h5ls`` and ``h5dump``. \n"
