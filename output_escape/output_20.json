The script `scripts/download_data.sh` is designed to download all of the requisite SDC1 data, however it is likely a BinderHub environment (such as mybinder) will not have the resources necessary to process or even store the full images.\n\nFor this situation, a small subsample of each image can be downloaded using the script `binder/download_sample_data.sh`.\n\nAfter downloading the sample data an example workflow notebook is provided at `analyse_sample.ipynb`.\n"
