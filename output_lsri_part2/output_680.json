These directory names are specified under the `-analyze` pcatype option (which performs differential calling) dcHiC where users denote a `--diffdir` where they want the analysis to be done. Multiple directories, with different analysis parameters, can be stored under the global DifferentialResult directory.  \nInside each *diffdir*, there are raw compartment results (\"expXX_data\") and two PC output directories `PcOri` and `PcQnm` with combined and quantile-normalized compartment results. Finally, there will be a directory `fdr_result` containing differential compartment, loop, and subcompartment results. Inside `fdr_result`, the `sample_combined` files contain complete bedGraphs with average PC values across replicates for all *XX* cell lines, as well as a final adjusted p-value denoting the significance of changes between Hi-C experiments for that compartment bin. The `sample_combined.Filtered` files contain the same information, filtered by a p-value cutoff.  \nBelow is a diagram of the overarching results structure, containing two different runs (\n```\ndcHiC_dir\n exp1_rep1_100kb_pca\n   intra_pca\n      [files]\n   inter_pca\n      [files]\n exp1_rep2_100kb_pca\n exp2_rep1_100kb_pca\n exp2_rep2_100kb_pca\n DifferentialResult\n   inter_100kb_diff\n     [files]\n   intra_100kb_diff\n     exp1_data\n     exp2_data\n     fdr_result\n     fithic_run\n     geneEnrichment\n     pcOri\n     pcQnm\n     viz\n```\n \n"

        ],
        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "There are a few technical implementation items to note:\n\n**Chromosomes:** If you are running into issues during running dcHiC, removing chrM, chrY and other non-standard chromosomes will help. There have been many issues raised about this; we highly recommend you [search](https://github.com/ay-lab/dcHiC/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22user+questions%22+is%3Aclosed) for the label \"user questions\" or \"not a bug\" under Issues if you encounter an error related to this. Also make sure that the chromosome labels in the matrices match the goldenPath files; see [this issue](https://github.com/ay-lab/dcHiC/issues/47). \n\n**Chromosome Name:** The chromosome names should have a 'chr' prefix with them. Please do not use a numeric vector (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ...) to represent chromosome names. \n\n**`fithic`/`dloop`**: If running `dloop`, dcHiC will first run Fit-Hi-C on the data. You will need to follow the Fit-Hi-C running procedure to do this, which will require generating a bias file. See \"FitHiC2 bias file format\" [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7451401/). \n\n**Support for other genomes:** While it has only been extensively tested for human and mouse genomes, dcHiC supports most other commonly-used genomes that are under the UCSC [genome page](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/). To utilize this, create a folder `*{genome}_{resolution}_goldenpathData*` (e.g hg38_100000_goldenpathData).\n\nWithin that folder put three files: \n- `{genome}.fa` (e.g. [hg38.fa](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz)) \n- `{genome}.tss.bed` (e.g. [hg38.tss.bed](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/genes/hg38.refGene.gtf.gz), the TSS file. Please make sure the TSS position is selected based on the strad direction!) Note that this may be named `.refGene.gtf.gz`. \n- `{genome}.chrom.sizes` (e.g. [hg38.chrom.sizes](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.chrom.sizes)). \n\nThese files can be found under the UCSC bigZips page for the specified genome. When running dcHiC use the `--gfolder` option in the `select` step to provide the folder path, and dcHiC will create the necessary files. \n \n**Compartment clustering:** Due to statistical noise, edge cases, and other factors, lone differential compartments occassionally crop up (ex: one bin is \"significant\" but all of its neighbors are not). These may be significant if analyzing at coarse resolution, but can also be misleading, especially if analyzing at very fine resolution. By default, dcHiC does not filter any of these lone compartments; however, there are two parameters to do so: `distclust` is the distance threshold for close differential regions to be a \"cluster.\" If it's 0, only adjacent differential compartments form a cluster. If it's 1, differential compartments separated by up to 1 bin are a cluster. The other parameter is `numberclust`, which is a filter for the minimum number of significant bins within a cluster. \n\n**Chromosome-arm wise PCA calculation**: In order to perform p and q-arm wise PCA calculations, please check the __run_dcHiC_chrArms_pca_step1.pl__ and __run_dcHiC_chrArms_combine_step2.pl__ scripts provided under the ```utility/Chromosome_ArmWise_PCA/``` folder.  \n"

        "description": "Today marks a substantial release for dcHiC. We've overhauled the last version, transitioning primarily to an R-based interface, and have built in large new changes. In addition to improving the core functionality of differential compartment calling, dcHiC now features: \r\n\r\n- Option to perform compartment computations on intra-chromosomal (cis) and inter-chromosomal (trans) Hi-C counts\r\n- Optimized PCA calculations (capable of analysis up to 5kb resolution)\r\n- HMM subcompartment identification based on compartment values\r\n- Identification of differential loops anchored in significant differential compartments (using Fit-Hi-C)\r\n\r\nOur updated version enables finer-grain, more robust, and more comprehensive analyses. While we hope that all users try the latest version of dcHiC, all code and documentation for the first version remains and we will continue offering support for it into the near future.",
