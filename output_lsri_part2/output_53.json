        "value": "The aim of this project is to create an alternative to the [USEARCH](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/) tool developed by Robert C. Edgar (2010). The new tool should:\n\n* have open source code with an appropriate open source license\n* be free of charge, gratis\n* have a 64-bit design that handles very large databases and much more than 4GB of memory\n* be as accurate or more accurate than usearch\n* be as fast or faster than usearch\n\nWe have implemented a tool called VSEARCH which supports *de novo* and reference based chimera detection, clustering, full-length and prefix dereplication, rereplication, reverse complementation, masking, all-vs-all pairwise global alignment, exact and global alignment searching, shuffling, subsampling and sorting. It also supports FASTQ file analysis, filtering, conversion and merging of paired-end reads.\n\nVSEARCH stands for vectorized search, as the tool takes advantage of parallelism in the form of SIMD vectorization as well as multiple threads to perform accurate alignments at high speed. VSEARCH uses an optimal global aligner (full dynamic programming Needleman-Wunsch), in contrast to USEARCH which by default uses a heuristic seed and extend aligner. This usually results in more accurate alignments and overall improved sensitivity (recall) with VSEARCH, especially for alignments with gaps.\n\n[VSEARCH binaries](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/latest) are provided for GNU/Linux on three 64-bit processor architectures: x86_64, POWER8 (ppc64le) and ARMv8 (aarch64). Binaries are also provided for macOS (version 10.9 Mavericks or later) on Intel (x86_64) and Apple Silicon (ARMv8), as well as Windows (64-bit, version 7 or higher, on x86_64). VSEARCH contains dedicated SIMD code for the three processor architectures (SSE2/SSSE3, AltiVec/VMX/VSX, Neon). In addition, VSEARCH uses the SIMD Everywhere (SIMDe) library to enable building on RISCV64, MIPS64EL, and other little-endian architectures.\n\n| CPU \\ OS      | GNU/Linux     | macOS  | Windows   |\n| ------------- | :-----------: | :----: | :-------: |\n| x86_64        |  \u2714            |  \u2714     |  \u2714        |\n| ARMv8         |  \u2714            |  \u2714     |           |\n| POWER8        |  \u2714            |        |           |\n| RISCV64       |  not tested   |        |           |\n| MIPS64EL      |  not tested   |        |           |\n\nVarious packages, plugins and wrappers are also available from other sources - see [below](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch#packages-plugins-and-wrappers).\n\nThe source code compiles correctly with `gcc` (versions 4.8.5 to 14.0)\nand `llvm-clang` (3.8 to 19.0). The source code should also compile on\n[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) and\n[NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/) systems.\n\nVSEARCH can directly read input query and database files that are compressed using gzip and bzip2 (.gz and .bz2) if the zlib and bzip2 libraries are available.\n\nMost of the nucleotide based commands and options in USEARCH version 7 are supported, as well as some in version 8. The same option names as in USEARCH version 7 has been used in order to make VSEARCH an almost drop-in replacement. VSEARCH does not support amino acid sequences or local alignments. These features may be added in the future.\n"

If the compression libraries [zlib](https://www.zlib.net) and/or [bzip2](https://www.sourceware.org/bzip2/) are installed on the system, they will be detected automatically and support for compressed files will be included in vsearch (see section **Dependencies** below). Support for compressed files may be disabled using the `--disable-zlib` and `--disable-bzip2` options to `configure`. A PDF version of the manual will be created from the `vsearch.1` manual file if `ps2pdf` is available, unless disabled using the `--disable-pdfman` option to `configure`. It is recommended to run configure with the options `CFLAGS=\"-O3\"` and `CXXFLAGS=\"-O3\"`. Other  options may also be applied to `configure`, please run `configure -h` to see them all. GNU autoconf (version 2.63 or later), automake and the GCC C++ (`g++`) compiler is required to build vsearch. Version 3.82 or later of `make` may be required on Linux, while version 3.81 is sufficient on macOS.\n\nThe distributed Linux ppc64le and aarch64 binaries were compiled using the C++ cross-compiler. The Windows binary was built using [Mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/).\n\n**Cloning the repo** Instead of downloading the source distribution as a compressed archive, you could clone the repo and build it as shown below. The options to `configure` as described above are still valid.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/torognes/vsearch.git\ncd vsearch\n./autogen.sh\n./configure CFLAGS=\"-O3\" CXXFLAGS=\"-O3\"\nmake ARFLAGS=\"cr\"\nsudo make install\n```\n\n**Binary distribution** Starting with version 1.4.0, binary distribution files containing pre-compiled binaries as well as the documentation will be made available as part of each [release](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases). The included executables include support for input files compressed by zlib and bzip2 (with files usually ending in `.gz` or `.bz2`).\n\nBinary distributions are provided for x86-64 systems running GNU/Linux, macOS (version 10.7 or higher) or Windows (64-bit, version 7 or higher), 64-bit AMDv8 (aarch64) systems running GNU/Linux or macOS, as well as POWER8 (ppc64le) systems running GNU/Linux.\n\nDownload the appropriate executable for your system using the following commands if you are using a Linux x86_64 system:\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch-2.29.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\ntar xzf vsearch-2.29.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n\nOr these commands if you are using a Linux ppc64le system:\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch-2.29.0-linux-ppc64le.tar.gz\ntar xzf vsearch-2.29.0-linux-ppc64le.tar.gz\n```\n\nOr these commands if you are using a Linux aarch64 (arm64) system:\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch-2.29.0-linux-aarch64.tar.gz\ntar xzf vsearch-2.29.0-linux-aarch64.tar.gz\n```\n\nOr these commands if you are using a Mac with an Apple Silicon CPU:\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch-2.29.0-macos-aarch64.tar.gz\ntar xzf vsearch-2.29.0-macos-aarch64.tar.gz\n```\n\nOr these commands if you are using a Mac with an Intel CPU:\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch-2.29.0-macos-x86_64.tar.gz\ntar xzf vsearch-2.29.0-macos-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n\nOr if you are using Windows, download and extract (unzip) the contents of this file:\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch-2.29.0-win-x86_64.zip\n```\n\nLinux and Mac: You will now have the binary distribution in a folder called `vsearch-2.29.0-linux-x86_64` or `vsearch-2.29.0-macos-x86_64` in which you will find three subfolders `bin`, `man` and `doc`. We recommend making a copy or a symbolic link to the vsearch binary `bin/vsearch` in a folder included in your `$PATH`, and a copy or a symbolic link to the vsearch man page `man/vsearch.1` in a folder included in your `$MANPATH`. The PDF version of the manual is available in `doc/vsearch_manual.pdf`. Versions with statically compiled libraries are available for Linux systems. These have \"-static\" in their name, and could be used on systems that do not have all the necessary libraries installed.\n\n**Windows**: You will now have the binary distribution in a folder\ncalled `vsearch-2.29.0-win-x86_64`. The vsearch executable is called\n`vsearch.exe`. The manual in PDF format is called\n`vsearch_manual.pdf`. If you want to be able to call `vsearch.exe`\nfrom any command prompt window, you can put the vsearch executable in\na folder (for instance `C:\\Users\\<yourname>\\bin`), and add the new\nfolder to the user `Path`: open the `Environment Variables` window by\nsearching for it in the Start menu, `Edit` user variables, add\n`;C:\\Users\\<yourname>\\bin` to the end of the `Path` variable, and save\nyour changes. The windows distribution also includes the `libbz2.dll`\nand `zlib1.dll` files required for reading compressed input\nfiles. These DLL's have been obtained for mingw-w64 from the MSYS2\nplatform.\n\n**Documentation** The VSEARCH user's manual is available in the `man` folder in the form of a [man page](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/blob/master/man/vsearch.1). A pdf version ([vsearch_manual.pdf](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch_manual.pdf)) will be generated by `make`. To install the manpage manually, copy the `vsearch.1` file or a create a symbolic link to `vsearch.1` in a folder included in your `$MANPATH`. The manual in both formats is also available with the binary distribution. The manual in PDF form ([vsearch_manual.pdf](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases/download/v2.29.0/vsearch_manual.pdf)) is also attached to the latest [release](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch/releases).\n\n"

If the compression libraries [zlib](https://www.zlib.net) and/or [bzip2](https://www.sourceware.org/bzip2/) are installed on the system, they will be detected automatically and support for compressed files will be included in vsearch (see section **Dependencies** below). Support for compressed files may be disabled using the `--disable-zlib` and `--disable-bzip2` options to `configure`. A PDF version of the manual will be created from the `vsearch.1` manual file if `ps2pdf` is available, unless disabled using the `--disable-pdfman` option to `configure`. It is recommended to run configure with the options `CFLAGS=\"-O3\"` and `CXXFLAGS=\"-O3\"`. Other  options may also be applied to `configure`, please run `configure -h` to see them all. GNU autoconf (version 2.63 or later), automake and the GCC C++ (`g++`) compiler is required to build vsearch. Version 3.82 or later of `make` may be required on Linux, while version 3.81 is sufficient on macOS.\n\nThe distributed Linux ppc64le and aarch64 binaries were compiled using the C++ cross-compiler.

Crusoe and his fellow Debian developers (PR #566),\r\n- add: official support for clang-19 and gcc 14,\r\n- add: beta support for clang-20,\r\n- remove: unused `--output` option for command `--fastq_stats` (issue #572),\r\n- fix: bug in `--sintax` when selecting the best lineage (only low confidence values below 0.5 were affected) (issue #573),\r\n- fix: out-of-bounds error in `--fastq_stats` when processing empty reads (issue #571),\r\n- fix: bug in `--cut`, patterns with multiple cutting sites were not detected (commit 4c4f9fa70f14b28d50185dbf322cf5727087e86a),\r\n- fix: memory error (segmentation fault) when using `--derep_id` and `--strand` (issue #565),\r\n- fix: `--fastq_join` now obeys to `--quiet` and `--log` options (commit 87f968b09f17c17ebf8db00aebe86e89b13a3948),\r\n- fix: `--fastq_join` quality padding is now also set to Q40 when quality offset is 64 (commit be0bf9b48d782286c4ce38f0bf1a4c82bd230250),\r\n- fix: (partial) `--fastq_join`'s handling of abundance annotations (commit f2bbcb421dc2f4dfa6603b9f31ec3e4598c1b591),\r\n- improve: additional safeguards to validate input values and to make sure that they are within acceptable limits. Changes concern options `--abskew` (commit a530dd8990f8a05cb25fc0b6a5da5a14d28fbedd) and `--fastq_maxdiffs` (commit 4b254db7f120bfd49e86185ef3cd9070c236f940),\r\n- improve: code quality (1.3k+ commits, 6k+ clang-tidy warnings eliminated),\r\n- improve: documentation and help messages (issue #568),\r\n- improve: complete refactoring and modernization of a subset of commands (`--sortbylength`, `--sortbysize`, `--shuffle`, `--rereplicate`, `--cut`, `--fastq_join`, `--fasta2fastq`, `--fastq_chars`),\r\n- improve: code-coverage of our test-suite for the above-mentioned commands (1,210 new tests, 4,753 in total).\r\n",

        "description": "The `sintax` command has been improved in several ways in this version of vsearch. Please note that several details of this algorithm is not clearly described in the preprint, and the implementation in vsearch differs from that in usearch.\r\n\r\nThe former vsearch version did not always choose the most common taxonomic entity over the 100 bootstraps among the database sequences with the highest amount of word similarity to the query. Instead, if several sequences had an equal similarity with the query, the sequence encountered in the earliest bootstrap was chosen. The confidence level was calculated based on this sequence compared to the selected sequences from the other 99 bootstraps. This could lead to a suboptimal choice with a low confidence. In the new version, the most common of the sequences with the highest amount of word similarity across the 100 bootstraps will be selected, and ties will be broken randomly.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with the old implementation was that if several sequences had the same amount of word similarity, the shortest one in the reference database would be chosen, and if they were equally long, the earliest in the database file would be chosen. A new option called `sintax_random` has now been introduced. This option will randomly select one of the sequences with the highest number of shared words with the query, without considering their length or position. This avoids a bias towards shorter reference sequences. This option is strongly recommended and will probably soon be the default.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a ninth taxonomic rank, strain (letter t), is now recognized. The speed of the sintax command has also been significantly improved at least in some cases. Run vsearch with the `randseed` option and 1 thread to ensure reproducibility of the random choices in the algorithm.",

These DLL's are included with the released distribution of vsearch 2.29.0 and later.\n\nTo create the PDF file with the manual the ps2pdf tool is required.
