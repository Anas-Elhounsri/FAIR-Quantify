The files can be downloaded using the format `{base_url}/runs/{run_id}/outputs/{path}`. By default, the base URL is `http://{host}:{port}{url_prefix}`. This feature is useful when using a reverse proxy such as Nginx or when a domain name is configured.\n"

If set to `true`, authentication is enabled.\n- `idp_provider`: Specifies the type of authentication provider, supporting `sapporo` or `external`. This allows you to switch the authentication provider.\n- `sapporo_auth_config`: Configuration for local authentication includes:\n  - `secret_key`: Secret key for signing JWTs. Changing this key is highly recommended.\n  - `expires_delta_hours`: The number of hours until the JWT expires. If null, the JWT never expires.\n  - `users`: List of users eligible for authentication, specifying username and password.\n- `external_config`: Configuration for external authentication includes:\n  - `idp_url`: URL to access the identity provider's configuration. This should be accessible from Sapporo at `{idp_url}/.well-known/openid-configuration`.\n  - `jwt_audience`: The expected audience claim in the JWT (e.g., `account`).\n  - `client_mode`: Mode of the client, either `confidential` or `public`.\n  - `client_id`: The client ID for the external authentication provider. This is used when `client_mode` is `confidential`.\n  - `client_secret`: The client secret for the external authentication provider. This is used when `client_mode` is `confidential`.\n\nFrom this configuration, there are two authentication modes: `sapporo` and `external`. When the mode is set to `sapporo`, Sapporo acts as an Identity Provider (IdP), issuing JWTs and handling authentication. In contrast, when the mode is set to `external`, authentication is delegated to an external IdP (e.g., Keycloak). In this scenario, Sapporo verifies the JWTs, but the JWTs are issued by the external IdP.\n\nEach mode is explained in more detail below.\n"
