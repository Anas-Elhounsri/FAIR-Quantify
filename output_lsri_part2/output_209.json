This tool takes sequences aligned to a reference, defines consensus splice sites, and quantifies isoforms. Users can edit splice sites through dynamic and interactive graphics and tables as part of their manual curation. Known transcripts, or isoforms detected by other methods, can also be imported as references for comparison. \n"

The `Padding (# of bases)` are the number of bases at each side of a candidate CES where other non-candidate CEC (below range in the frequency filter) are merged.

Once is complete, a download bottom will appear on the screen. The second panel is dedicated to align the raw reads (in FASTQ format) using GMAP. To do so, upload the ZIP file downloaded from the previous panel as the reference index, the FASTQ file, chose the number of threads and click `Run mapping`. Once the reads alignment is done, a download bottom will appear to retrieve the mapped sequences. In case of selecting the BAM option as an output, two download bottoms will appear: the mapped reads (BAM) and its index (BAI). The BAI file is require, for example, to upload the BAM file in IGV. The last column performs the alignment using Minimap2. In this case the reference must be in FASTA format (the same file used to build the GMAP index in the first panel). Although two major solutions for the alignment are made available, we recommend using GMAP as Minimap2 has problem aligning small exons. This limitation is advised in their GitHub (https://github.com/lh3/minimap2), in the \u201cLimitations\u201d section.\n\n\n\n\n"
