If you want the tool to take the GO enrichment and KEGG pathways analysis, R is suggested to be installed together.

You can install all the dependencies before running MStoCIRC or tempt to run with files in'/data'. And the tool will tempt firstly to install the dependencies automatically, during this period please keep the Internet connected for MStoCIRC. \n  \nWe introduce modified <u>IRESfinder [here](https://github.com/xiaofengsong/IRESfinder) </u>with into MStoCIRC for function module \" IRES_predict \", and explain here on purpose what we do with their team tool to respect for their copyright.\n\n<u>Please transform your important input file format as same as the test input file in '\\data' recognized well by MStoCIRC </u>. And there are not specific requirements for general input file,such as genome sequences file (.fa, .fna format) and genome annotation file (.gtf or .gff format), but we recommend to download them from NCBI websiten [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term= \"here\"). \n\nTo perform one specific function of small program, here we do not describe them about how to use the small program in detail, and README file in their own folers are available which contain the usage information.\n\nThank you for your downloading and running this tool.

Running requirement:\n**Mass Spectrometry to Translatable CircRNAs (MStoCIRC)** is available at <u>https://github.com/QUMU00/mstocirc-master</u>, and *it can work well without being installed in operating systerm* after you set the parameters properly, saving the time of installing it in the operating system.\n\nMStoCIRC includes one main program and several small programs and during statistics analysis, those small programs are called to perform their specific functions by main program. Except enrichment analysis part dependent on package 'clusterProfiler' in R environment, the body of other main and small are programmed by Python3 language, meaning that *Python3 installation for your computer is necessary condition to run MStoCIRC*. If you want the tool to take the GO enrichment and KEGG pathways analysis, R is suggested to be installed together. But both `Python3` and `R Language` are the well-used programming languages for science research, therefore it's easy to satisfy the requirements for MStoCIRC. \n\nMStoCIRC doesn't rely on other tool (e.g. bedtool), but like other application developed by Python3 it needs some dependencies. <u>'matplotlib'</u> and <u>'scikit-learn'</u> module for Python3 and package <u>'clusterProfiler' </u> for R. You can install all the dependencies before running MStoCIRC or tempt to run with files in'/data'. And the tool will tempt firstly to install the dependencies automatically, during this period please keep the Internet connected for MStoCIRC. \n  \nWe introduce modified <u>IRESfinder [here](https://github.com/xiaofengsong/IRESfinder) </u>with into MStoCIRC for function module \" IRES_predict \", and explain here on purpose what we do with their team tool to respect for their copyright.\n\n<u>Please transform your important input file format as same as the test input file in '\\data' recognized well by MStoCIRC </u>. And there are not specific requirements for general input file,such as genome sequences file (.fa, .fna format) and genome annotation file (.gtf or .gff format), but we recommend to download them from NCBI websiten [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term= \"here\"). \n\nTo perform one specific function of small program, here we do not describe them about how to use the small program in detail, and README file in their own folers are available which contain the usage information.\n\nThank you for your downloading and running this tool. If you have any questions, vcontact with us by email **(glli@snnu.edu.cn)**.\n\nEdited by Zhou Cao on October 4th, 2021.<br>Thank you....\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://img0.baidu.com/it/u=4197095029,2338689732&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG?w=499&h=359\" style=\"marge:0 auto;\" />\n\n\n"
