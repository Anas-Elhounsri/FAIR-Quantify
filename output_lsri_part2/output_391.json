        "description": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Major Update: The new gmso-mosdef-gomc files were created, which allows GOMC to use the LJ and Mie FFs via GMSO format. This allows the user to specify the potential energy equations explicitly in the FF file via a string for the bonded and non-bonded interactions, including different units (unyt package) and scalar values.  These are different files in the formats folder.\r\nMinor Update: The parmed-mosdef-gomc updates are for changing the occupancy and beta numbers in the PDB file to fix molecules/atoms in GOMC or NAMD or both for a hybrid simulation. This is mostly for NAMD when running hybrid MCMD simulations via the py-MCMD software. Note: The plan is for the parmed mosdef-gomc version to be deprecated by the end of 2022 @bc118 in https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/pull/18\r\n* changed conversion.py header and added a space on 2 init.py files by @bc118 in https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/pull/31\r\n* In the README file, added links to readthedocs and reference page by @bc118 in https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/pull/32\r\n* added zenodo reference by @bc118 in https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/pull/33\r\n* added credits for main people involved in the project. by @bc118 in https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/pull/34\r\n* changed to correct conda-forge call on README by @bc118 in https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/pull/35\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/GOMC-WSU/MoSDeF-GOMC/commits/1.0.0\r\n",
