        "description": "The major release 2.0.0 contains two major features: Active Learning and Parallelisation Acceleration. \r\n\r\nThe best way to familiarise yourself is going to be via using the Jupiter notebooks. Please get in touch if you spot any errors, or if you'd like to see any improvements. \r\n\r\nActive learning is carried out with scipy and supports multiple models and querying strategies. This is further parallelised with Dask, which can split the work across CPUs, different PCs (over -ssh), cluster (PBS, SLURM, etc), and more.\r\n\r\nThe major changes have been encoded in the new class called ChemSpace. However, some of the previous minute functions were modified to simplify the interactions between Dask and them. This means that not all previous functions have the same interface. \r\n\r\nThis release also contains a number of small fixes. \r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Daskify rlist by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/69\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minor\r\n* Libraries initiated on request by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/34\r\n* Single SDFs for libraries by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/37\r\n* library order by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/38\r\n* Gnina error handling by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/39\r\n* Wording: Wrong Atoms picking for building a molecule by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/40\r\n* ANI - exploded conformers by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/42\r\n* A scaffold: allow the use of a previously minimised structure as a starting scaffold by default.  by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/43\r\n* Builder: growing not just from hydrogens by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/44\r\n* We don't need the hydrogens. by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/45\r\n* Make more use of openmm pdbfile by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/46\r\n* A growing vector splits the molecule into several components by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/47\r\n* Saving MDAnalysis-readable .pdb files by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/49\r\n* Keeping original scaffold by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/52\r\n* update HBD/HBA calc for Lipinski by @RPirie96 in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/51\r\n* No Hs in RMS to avoid the wrong hydrogens being compared by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/55\r\n* Present gnina \"CNNAffinity->IC50\" as Kd [nM] with pint-pandas by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/59\r\n* Linkers and RGroups are now dataframes - easier API access by @bieniekmateusz in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/62\r\n* CLI high throughput scoring  by @jthorton in https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/pull/64\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/cole-group/FEgrow/compare/v1.3.0...v2.0.0",
