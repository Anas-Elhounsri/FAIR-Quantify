It is reasonable to wonder \"where am I supposed to get this information?\" While there are a couple possibilities, perhaps the easiest and most widely applicable is [bam2bakR](https://github.com/simonlabcode/bam2bakR), a Snakemake implementation of the [TimeLapse pipeline](https://bitbucket.org/mattsimon9/timelapse_pipeline/src/master/) developed by the Simon lab. bam2bakR takes as input aligned bam files and produces, among other things, the cB file required by bakR. Extensive documentation describing how to get bam2bakR up and running is available on its GitHub repo. Snakemake greatly facilitates running this pipeline on almost any computational infrastructure and bam2bakR uses the conda/mamba package manager to make setting up the necessary dependencies a breeze. \nAs of version 1.0.0, bakR can also take as input fraction new (sometimes referred to as new-to-total ratio, or NTR) estimates. These are obtainable via tools like [GRAND-SLAM](https://github.com/erhard-lab/gedi/wiki/GRAND-SLAM), or perhaps a custom analysis pipeline that you developed while working with NR-seq datasets!\n \n"

Particularly appropriate for those who are very comfortable with adopting new bioinformatic tools.\n  3. [Combining bakR with differential expression analysis](https://simonlabcode.github.io/bakR/articles/Differential-Synth.html) to perform differential synthesis rate analysis (title: Differential synthesis analysis with bakR and DESeq2).\n  4. [How to use fraction new estimates (e.g., from a tool like GRAND-SLAM) as input to bakR](https://simonlabcode.github.io/bakR/articles/bakR-Fn.html), a new feature introduced in version 1.0.0 (title: GRAND-SLAM output/fn estimates as bakR input).\n  5.

This phenomenon, termed dropout, is discussed in two recent preprints, one from [our lab](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.542133v1) and one from the [Erhard lab](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.21.537786v1.full).\n  6.

In either case, once you (and your compiler if necessary) are ready, bakR can be installed as follows:\n\n    install.packages(\"bakR\") \n\nTo install the newest version of bakR from Github, you need to have a C++ compiler configured to rstan's (the R interface to the probabilistic programming language [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) that bakR uses on the backend) liking. The best way to do this is to follow the Stan team's [helpful documentation](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) on installing rstan for your operating system.

GRAND-SLAM input functionality is further supported by the new `GSprocess` function that will facilitate converting from GRAND-SLAM output to bakR input.\r\n* `FnPCA` has been deprecated in favor of `FnPCA2` which accepts input differently and fixes some bugs.\r\n* Read count filtering now includes two filters. One read count that all samples must pass, and one that only all replicates in a single Exp_ID need to pass. This facilitates identifying large increases or decreaes in expression.\r\n* Several new vignettes to discuss much of the new functionality discussed above.\r\n* Several small bug fixes\r\n",

        "value": "Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data can identify changes in cellular RNA levels, but cannot determine the kinetic mechanism underlying such changes. Previously, [our lab](https://simonlab.yale.edu/research/transcriptome-dynamics/timelapse-chemistry/) and others addressed this shortcoming by developing nucleotide-recoding RNA-seq methods (NR-seq; e.g., TimeLapse-seq) to quantify changes in RNA synthesis and degradation kinetics. While advanced statistical models implemented in user-friendly software (e.g., DESeq2) have ensured the statistical rigor of differential expression analyses, no such tools that facilitate differential kinetic analysis with NR-seq exist. To address this need, we developed bakR, an R package that analyzes and compares NR-seq datasets. Differential kinetics analysis with bakR relies on a Bayesian hierarchical model of NR-seq data to increase statistical power by sharing information across transcripts. bakR outperforms attempts to use single sample analysis tools (e.g., pulseR and GRAND-SLAM) for differential kinetics analysis. Check out [our manuscript in RNA](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/29/7/958.abstract) to learn more about the model and its extensive validation!\n"
