It is not necessarily close to the gene to be acted on, because the entanglement structure of chromatin allows the positions far apart in the sequence to have the op-portunity to contact each other. Therefore, identifying enhancers and their strength is a complex and challenging task. In this article, a new prediction method based on deep learning is proposed to identify enhancers and enhancer strength, called iEnhancer-DCLA. Firstly, we use word2vec to convert k-mers into number vectors to construct an input matrix. Secondly, we use convolutional neural network and bidi-rectional long short-term memory network to extract sequence features, and finally use the attention mechanism to extract relatively important features. In the task of predicting enhancers and their strengths, this method has improved to a certain ex-tent in most evaluation indexes. In summary, we believe that this method provides new ideas in the analysis of enhancers."
