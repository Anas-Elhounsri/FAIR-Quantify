        "description": "# New features\r\n* Added **support for *Solanum lycopersicum* (tomato)** (see folder [data_sly](https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/tree/main/data_sly)).\r\n* Added support to omit the motif enrichment analysis. In this mode, **all possible species are supported**, but note that the resulting networks are more prone to false positives. \r\n* Added a **new output format**: edge table with regulon rank and edge weights. \r\n* Added regulator heatmap as additional output figure ([example](https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/blob/main/example/OUTPUTS/figures/miniexExample_regmap_8.svg)).\r\n* Enrichment background is now filtered for expressed genes, usually leading to an **increased number of predicted regulons**. \r\n* When computing enrichment: minimum number of hits is set to 2 to relax FDR statistics.\r\n* Updated gene GO annotation for Arabidopsis.\r\n* Added gene alias file for _Zea mays_.\r\n* Added input file validation step.\r\n* Dataset statistics are printed after the input validation step.\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n* Added the [pipeline schema](https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/blob/main/docs/MINI-EX_scheme.png) with detailed explanations to the README.\r\n* Added constraints for the input files in [Prepare your files](https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/blob/main/docs/data_preparation.md).\r\n* Added an example of the expression matrix generation from a Seurat object in [Prepare your files](https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/blob/main/docs/data_preparation.md).\r\n* Added the [FAQ](https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/blob/main/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/VIB-PSB/MINI-EX/compare/v1.0...v2.0",
