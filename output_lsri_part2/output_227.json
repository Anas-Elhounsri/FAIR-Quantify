This results in more confident peptide\nidentifications, which allows you to get **more peptide IDs** at the same false discovery rate\n(FDR) threshold, or to set a **more stringent FDR threshold** while still retaining a similar\nnumber of peptide IDs. MS\u00b2Rescore is **ideal for challenging proteomics identification workflows**,\nsuch as proteogenomics, metaproteomics, or immunopeptidomics. \n"
