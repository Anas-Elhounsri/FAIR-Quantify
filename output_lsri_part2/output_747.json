        "value": "\r\nThe  package includes six sample data sets:\r\n\r\n  - `bp_hypnos`: The data set contains ABPM measurements from n=\r\n    5subjects with type 2diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea. The\r\n    recordings are taken every hour during the 24-hour period for each\r\n    of the two visits that are 3 months apart. Additional information\r\n    includes sleep/wake indicator for each recording inferred from a\r\n    wrist-worn actigraphy device. The aim of original study (Rooney et\r\n    al.2021) is to determine the effect of positive airway pressure\r\n    treatment of sleep apnea on glycemic control and blood pressure of\r\n    patients with type 2diabetes. The included data is a subset of the\r\n    full data described in [Rooneyet\r\n    al.(2021)](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02454153)\r\n  - `bp_jhs`: The data set consists of HBPM measurements from a [2019\r\n    single-subject pilot\r\n    study](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/r4r) during an\r\n    endured aerobic (endurance) exercise: cycling 5,775 miles from New\r\n    York City, New York to Seward, Alaska over the course of 95 days.\r\n    Data was collected using an Omron Evolv wireless blood pressure\r\n    monitor twice per day (in the morning upon waking up and in the\r\n    evening before bed). The aim of original study (Schwenck 2019) is to\r\n    assess blood pressure variability across different environments\r\n    through time.\r\n  - `bp_ghana`: The data set contains HBPM measurements on n=\r\n    757subjects across 32 community health centers from\r\n    cluster-randomized trial in Ghana: 389 subjects are in the health\r\n    insurance coverage (HIC) group and 368 subjects are in another group\r\n    consisting of a combination of HIC with a nurse-led task-shifting\r\n    strategy for hypertension control (TASSH)(this group is denoted\r\n    TASSH + HIC). Baseline blood pressure measurements were collected,\r\n    with 85% of subjects having available 12 month follow-up\r\n    measurements. The aim of original study (Ogedegbe et al.2018) is to\r\n    assess the comparative effectiveness of HIC alone versus the\r\n    combination of TASSH + HIC on reducing systolic blood pressure among\r\n    patients with uncontrolled hypertension in Ghana.\r\n  - `bp_preg`: The data set contains HBPM measurements from n= 209women,\r\n    each of whom were recorded every 30 minutes during the Pregnancy Day\r\n    Assessment Clinic (PDAC) observation window for up to a maximum of\r\n    240 minutes (i.e.\u00a0a maximum of 8 total readings per subject per\r\n    observation window) in addition to an initial \u201cbooking\u201d reading\r\n    before the PDAC assessment. The aim of the original study (McCarthy\r\n    et al.2015) is to investigate the pregnancy-induced hypertension and\r\n    pre-eclampsia prediction to determine whether the blood pressure\r\n    assessment of the first observation window of 1 hour (60 minutes) is\r\n    sufficiently accurate relative to the standard 4 hour (240 minute)\r\n    window.\r\n  - `bp_children`: The data set contains HBPM measurements on n= 1,283\r\n    children from Bristol, UK. Three blood pressure readings per visit\r\n    were collected over the course of two observation periods (at ages 9\r\n    and 11). Additionally, information on their physical activity has\r\n    been collected. The aim of original study (Solomon-Moore et al.2020)\r\n    is to examine how sedentary behavior affect children progressing\r\n    through primary school, and to understand the relationship between\r\n    elevated blood pressure in children and its impact on the\r\n    development of cardiovascular disease into adulthood.\r\n  - `bp_rats`: The data set contains AP measurements sampled at 100 Hz\r\n    of the SS (n1= 9) and SS.13 (n2= 6) genetic strains of Dahl rats.\r\n    Each mouse was administered either a low sodium or a high sodium\r\n    diet. The aim of original study (Bugenhagen et al.2010) is to\r\n    investigate the connection between the dysfunction of the baroreflex\r\n    control system in Dahl rats and salt-sensitive Hypertension\r\n\r \n"

        "value": "\r\nThe `bp` package is designed to allow the user to initialize a processed\r\ndataframe through the `process_data` function by specifying any\r\ncombination of the following variables present in the user-supplied data\r\nset (with the minimum requirement that `SBP` and `DBP` are included).\r\nThe package will then utilize the processed dataframe to calculate\r\nvarious metrics from medical and statistical literature and provide\r\nvisualizations. Perhaps the most useful user-friendly feature of the\r\npackage is the ability to generate a visualization report to discern\r\nrelationships and assess blood pressure stage progression among\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nThe package has the ability to make use of the following physiological\r\nvariables (expressed as integers):\r\n\r\n  - Systolic Blood Pressure (`SBP`) measured in mmHg\r\n  - Diastolic Blood Pressure (`DBP`) measured in mmHg\r\n  - Arterial Pressure (`AP`) (if applicable)\r\n  - Heart Rate (`HR`) measured in bpm\r\n  - Pulse Pressure (`PP`) measured in mmHg which is calculated as SBP -\r\n    DBP\r\n  - Mean Arterial Pressure (`MAP`) measured in mmHg\r\n  - Rate Pressure Product (`RPP`) which is calculated as SBP multiplied\r\n    by resting HR\r\n\r\nThere are also processing functionality for arterial pressure (AP) data\r\nwhich include the following inputs: \\* A column corresponding to the AP\r\ndata (`AP`) \\* Time elapsed (`time_elap`)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are a suite of processing capabilities within the\r\n`process_data` function such as:\r\n\r\n  - `DATE_TIME`: A column coreresponding to a date/time object\r\n    (typically `as.POSIXct` format) such as `12/1/2020 13:42:07`\r\n  - `ID`: Identification of individuals\r\n  - `VISIT`: The visit of each individual, if more than one (integer)\r\n  - `WAKE`: A binary indicator where 1 denotes awake and 0 denotes\r\n    asleep (binary 1 or 0)\r\n  - `GROUP`: An arbitrary column that can be used to group data\r\n    according to this category (such as gender or age)\r\n  - `EOD`: Denotes the end-of-day which can be adjusted for situations\r\n    where individuals may take readings after midnight\r\n  - `DATA_SCREEN`: A screening proceedure to remove outliers based on\r\n    upper and lower limits of BP readings\r\n  - `AGG`: An aggregation option to average consecutive readings taken\r\n    within quick succession\r\n  - `CHRON_ORDER`: Adjust the chronology of the readings (chronological\r\n    vs reverse-chronological)\r\n  - `TZ`: Time zone adjustment\r\n\r\nAfter all available variables are identified and processed, the\r\nresulting processed dataframe is used for all other functions.\r\n\r\nUnique to the `bp` package is the ability to create additional columns\r\nthat might not originally be present in the supplied data set. At\r\ncurrent, the following additional columns will be created:\r\n\r\n  - `TIME_OF_DAY` - Corresponds to the Time of Day (Morning, Afternoon,\r\n    Evening, or Night) based on `DATE_TIME` column\r\n  - `DAY_OF_WEEK` - Corresponds to the Day of the week: a useful column\r\n    for table visuals. Based on `DATE_TIME` column\r\n  - `SBP_CATEGORY` - Systolic Blood Pressure Stages (Low, Normal,\r\n    Elevated, Stage 1, Stage 2, Crisis) as defined by the American Heart\r\n    Association (AHA)\r\n  - `DBP_CATEGORY` - Diastolic Blood Pressure Stages (Low, Normal,\r\n    Elevated, Stage 1, Stage 2, Crisis) as defined by the American Heart\r\n    Association (AHA)\r\n  - `BP_CLASS` - A two-to-one mapping of SBP and DBP readings that\r\n    expands on the original AHA categories using a more recent\r\n    adaptation by (Lee et al 2018)\r\n\r\nSee examples below for further details.\r\n\r \n"

Load and process data into a new usable dataframe for all further\r\n    analysis using the `process_data` function\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n``` r\r\n#devtools::install_github(\"johnschwenck/bp\")\r\nlibrary(bp)\r\n\r\n## Load bp_hypnos\r\ndata(bp_hypnos)\r\n\r\n## Process bp_hypnos\r\nhypnos_proc <- process_data(bp_hypnos, \r\n                     sbp = 'syst', \r\n                     dbp = 'diast', \r\n                     date_time = 'date.time', \r\n                     hr = 'hr', \r\n                     pp = 'PP', \r\n                     map = 'MaP', \r\n                     rpp = 'Rpp', \r\n                     id = 'id', \r\n                     visit = 'Visit', \r\n                     wake = 'wake')\r\n#> 2 values exceeded the DUL or DLL thresholds and were coerced to NA\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** the `process_data` function is insensitive to capitalization\r\nof the supplied data column names. For this example, even though the\r\noriginal column name \u201cSYST\u201d exists in the `bp_hypnos`, \u201csyst\u201d is still\r\nan acceptable name to be given to the function as shown. For emphasis,\r\nall of the above column names were intentionally entered using the wrong\r\ncapitalization.\r\n\r\n`SBP` and `DBP` must be specified for any other functions to work\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n2.  Using the newly processed `hypnos_proc`, we can now calculate\r\n    various metrics. Now that the included raw `bp_hypnos` dataset has\r\n    been processed into `hypnos_proc`, we can now instead rely on this\r\n    new dataframe to calculate various metrics and visualizations. The\r\n    calculation of the nocturnal dipping classification is shown below,\r\n    using a subset of only two of the subjects for comparison (subjects\r\n    70417 and 70435):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n``` r\r\ndip_calc(hypnos_proc, subj = c(70417, 70435))\r\n#> [[1]]\r\n#> # A tibble: 8 x 6\r\n#> # Groups:   ID, VISIT [4]\r\n#>   ID    VISIT WAKE  avg_SBP avg_DBP     N\r\n#>   <fct> <fct> <fct>   <dbl>   <dbl> <int>\r\n#> 1 70417 1     0        123.    60.5    10\r\n#> 2 70417 1     1        128     66.6    20\r\n#> 3 70417 2     0        136.    60.5     8\r\n#> 4 70417 2     1        136.    65.6    17\r\n#> 5 70435 1     0        106.    63       6\r\n#> 6 70435 1     1        129.    82.1    23\r\n#> 7 70435 2     0        136.    79.2     9\r\n#> 8 70435 2     1        123.    72.5    20\r\n#> \r\n#> [[2]]\r\n#> # A tibble: 4 x 6\r\n#> # Groups:   ID [2]\r\n#>   ID    VISIT  dip_sys class_sys  dip_dias class_dias\r\n#>   <fct> <fct>    <dbl> <chr>         <dbl> <chr>     \r\n#> 1 70417 1      0.0359  non-dipper   0.0916 non-dipper\r\n#> 2 70417 2     -0.00450 reverse      0.0784 non-dipper\r\n#> 3 70435 1      0.179   dipper       0.233  extreme   \r\n#> 4 70435 2     -0.104   reverse     -0.0927 reverse\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn terms of statistical metrics, the `bp_stats` function aggregates many\r\nof the variability and center metrics into one table which makes\r\ncomparing the different measures to one another very convenient.
