        "description": "AMRFinderPlus v3.12.8 includes a new database format version. Because this version is incompatible with AMRFinderPlus databases from previous versions, amrfinder -u must be run once the software update is installed to get the latest version of the database.\r\n\r\nThis update includes the changes: \r\n- Reference proteins now have stop codons. Input proteins that are not terminated with a \u2018*\u2019 character are assumed to have a \u2018*\u2019 at the end. \r\n- Extended proteins are no longer \u201cEXACT\u201d hits, so the protein names will be that of the parent node for alleles. \r\n- If a protein is hit by blast and the Blast Rule is violated, the Blast Rule of the parent family is checked, etc.\r\n- `--annotation_format prodigal` input format added\r\n\r\nThis means that Previously extended hits that were 100% identical to, but longer than proteins in the database were called with the method \"EXACTP\" and now they are called \"BLASTP\". Blast results will still indicate that 100% of the database reference was covered at 100% identity, and you should still see that the \"Target length\" is longer than the \"Reference sequence length\".\r\n\r\n1. Extended hits to allele sequences that were previously called EXACTP already had the element symbol was one node up the hierarchy (i.e. the gene symbol, not the allele symbol) the \"Sequence name\" was that of the ALLELE reference, and thus inconsistent with the element symbol assigned. This has been changed. Again, this does not affect previous \"Element symbol\" calls.\r\n\r\n2. In combined protein + nucleotide runs of AMRFinderPlus extended protein sequences with exact matches in the database were ignored and the nucleotide match was taken resulting in an EXACTX match with no protein accession provided. Now the protein match with method BLASTP will be reported. \r\n\r\nTo reiterate, gene symbols should not change. Sequence names will only change if the query is an extended version of a protein 100% identical and completely covering an allele in the database. \r\n",

This release will likely have no effect for most AMRFinderPlus users.\r\n\r\n- Fixes an unusual crash when using the `--ident_min` option with very low identity cutoffs (we generally don't recommend using this option).\r\n- A change in the behavior of the [`--print_node`](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/wiki/Running-AMRFinderPlus#option--print_node) option. It will now print the node associated with the element reported, rather than the most specific node hit.  This changes the node reported for non-exact blast hits to reference sequences of named alleles to report the parent node. It should have no effect on all other hits and does not affect the behavior of AMRFinderPlus in any field other than `hierarchy_node`.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "This is a minor software release update with two changes. A bug fix for a very rare bug with mild consequences, and a minor improvement in the functionality of the --update option. \r\n\r\nThe release fixes a bug when AMRFinderPlus is run in combined nucleotide and protein mode where only a partial gene was assembled for proteins with long amino-acid repeats (e.g., espF, CAI43856.1). In the right circumstances AMRFinderPlus could report multiple combined hits to the same gene with the same start and stop coordinates. We've only seen the exact triggering circumstances a few times in more than a million assemblies, so it should be very rare. This release fixes that bug.\r\n\r\nThe release also contains a minor improvement to `amrfinder_update` to also create the parent database directory if it doesn't exist when `amrfinder_update` is run.\r\n",

        "description": "This release has two primary changes\r\n\r\n1. Version checking for blast on Mac to avoid the bug in BLAST 2.12.0 with the `-mt_mode` parameter\r\n2. Updated handling of special characters in the sequence identifiers in GFF and FASTA files.\r\n\r\n### Special character handling\r\n\r\nImplemented special character handling in GFF files according to <https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md>. The following need to be escaped in the sequence identifiers using URL-style codes in .gff files:\r\n\r\n   - \\# (comment start)\r\n   - tab (%09)\r\n   - newline (%0A)\r\n   - carriage return (%0D)\r\n   - % percent (%25)\r\n   - control characters (%00 through %1F, %7F)\r\n   - ; semicolon (%3B)\r\n   - = equals (%3D)\r\n   - & ampersand (%26)\r\n   - , comma (%2C)\r\n\r\nAdded input checking for nucleotide sequences because 'makeblastdb' truncates and/or alters sequence identifiers with the following characteristics. Now nucleotide FASTA identifiers (characters after '>' and before the first whitespace) with any of the following will cause `amrfinder` to exit with an error message.\r\n\r\n   - FASTA identifier starts with '?'\r\n   - FASTA identifier contains the two character sequence ',,' or '\\t' (the character '\\\\' followed by the character 't')\r\n   - FASTA identifier ends with ';' '~' ',' or '.'\r\n\r\n### Bug fix for Bioconda compatibility\r\n\r\nOn Mac the BLAST parameter -mt_mode requires BLAST version 2.13.0 to run on short query sequences.\r\n\r\nThis release includes a bug-fix to allow AMRFinderPlus to be compatible with Bioconda which doesn't have BLAST+ version 2.13.0 for the Mac. The previous [release 3.11.8](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/releases/tag/amrfinder_v3.11.8) could not be added to Bioconda because at the time of release Bioconda did not have BLAST+ version 2.13.0 for Mac.\r\n\r\nSee also release notes for version 3.10.8: https://github.com/ncbi/amr/releases/tag/amrfinder_v3.11.8",

        "description": "NOTE: This version uses the `blastx` option `-mt_mode 1` which was released in BLAST+ version 2.12.0, but there was a bug in the Mac OSX implementation. The current latest BLAST+ version (2.13.0) does not have that bug, so this release is only compatible with BLAST+ 2.13.0 on the Mac.\r\n\r\nThe Bioconda package for BLAST+ 2.13.0 was not compiled for the Mac for some reason (https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/pull/35897), so the latest BLAST+ version available in bioconda for Mac OSX is 2.12.0. For that reason this version will not be released in bioconda.\r\n\r\nWe are working on a fix and hope to have a new compatible with bioconda release soon.\r\n\r\n- Performance improvements by optimizing blast parameters\r\n    - Faster by 70% on single-threaded on nucleotide-only run\r\n    - Faster by 64% on single-threaded protein-only run\r\n   -  Faster by 58% on single-threaded combined run\r\n- Improved handling of special characters\r\n    - To simplify issues I would avoid '#' ',' '%' '=' '&' and ':' in sequence identifiers, though they should now be correctly handled with escape sequences in GFF files. See the documentation of `--gff` for more information.\r\n    - Fixed handling for FASTA identifiers with leading underscore \"_\" (https://github.com/ncbi/amr/issues/115)\r\n    - Added `--annotation_format standard`",

Ironically\r\nthe easiest way to future-proof automatic AMRFinderPlus database updates was\r\nto move back to the FTP protocol for updates because the file list is built into the\r\nFTP protocol.\r\n\r\nIf this causes issues for your application please let us know at pd-help@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.\r\nVersion 3.10.20 is functionally equivalent and will continue to work for the \r\nforeseeable future with identical results to version 3.10.21 (but using HTTP for \r\ndatabase updates).\r\n",

This is because the format of the dynamically generated HTTP listing of files on ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov was changed by admins, something we didn't know was in the works. \r\n\r\nFor a day or so (some time on 13-Jan-2022 to 10:41am EST on 14-Jan-2022) versions prior to 3.10.20 would crash if a database update was attempted. We quickly developed and released released a patched version of the software that can handle the changes (3.10.20). In the meantime we realized there was a way to mitigate the issue on the server, so we implemented that as well. As of 10:41am EST on 14-Jan-2022 versions of AMRFinderPlus newer than 3.2 should all work again.\r\n\r\nApologies for the alarmist earlier version of this message. All should be well now, and we are discussing ways to make the system more robust in the future. (Some discussion on issue https://github.com/ncbi/amr/issues/70). At this time there is no functional reason to prefer this version over  [3.10.18](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/releases/tag/amrfinder_v3.10.18) (other than just wanting to be the cool kid with the latest).",

        "description": "**AMRFinderPlus v3.8.28** has several changes, new features requested by users, and some optimization of the handling of certain edge cases.\r\n\r\n - amrfinder -u option no longer overwrites databases if they already exist.\r\n New --force_update option will still overwrite the database as the old -u\r\n option did. (https://github.com/ncbi/amr/issues/16)\r\n - New --protein_output and --nucleotide_output options will produce FASTA files\r\n containing the sequence of AMRFinderPlus hits\r\n - --mutation_all output has been streamlined and some bugs have been fixed\r\n - New --name option will prepend a \"Name\" field to every row of the\r\n AMRFinderPlus report (https://github.com/ncbi/amr/issues/25)\r\n - Fusion genes are now reported with both element symbols separated by a '/' on\r\n both lines of the report. E.g., aac(6')-Ie/aph(2'')-If2\r\n - For HMM-only hits (have HMM in the method column which means they do not have\r\n BLAST results that meet cutoff) BLAST statistics will now be reported\r\n if any alignment at that location was made.\r\n - When in COMBINED (nucleotide + protein) mode and when an \"INTERNAL_STOP\" is detected\r\n at a locus that also has a protein, the protein result will be reported with\r\n Method of INTERNAL_STOP (Previously the nucleotide result was reported. This\r\n would affect the identity, length, and coverage statistics AMRFinderPlus reports.)\r\n - Improved handling of partial alignments for point-mutation detection, including\r\n prioritization of translated matches (POINTX) when the protein match identifies fewer\r\n known SNPs.\r\n - Incorrect amino acids inferred by protein annotations extended in the 5' (N-terminal)\r\n direction because correct annotations start with alternative start codons will\r\n no longer count as mismatches.\r\n - Small improvements in performance.",

        "description": "**AMRFinderPlus v3.8.4** includes changes related to an NCBI initiative to change from using GI's to Accessions as the primary sequence identifier, which has necessitated a change in the database format.\r\n\r\nThis includes fixes for a few bugs including fixing the path issues using bioconda on the Mac to install AMRFinderPlus and improved error messages for issue https://github.com/ncbi/amr/issues/28.\r\n\r\nIn order to use the latest version of the AMRFinderPlus database (2020-05-04.1 at the time of release) you must upgrade to this version of the software.\r\n\r\nBecause this version is incompatible with AMRFinderPlus databases from previous versions, amrfinder -u must be run once this update is installed to get the latest version of the database.",
