Model errors will be the same when trained with either log transformed nM or log transformed M values (except for random processes), since labels are simple shiften by 9.** \n<h2 id=\"table-of-contents\"> :book: Table of Contents</h2> \n\nIn a benchmark study we collected and curated bioactivity data on 30 macromolecular targets, which were used to evaluate \nthe performance of many machine learning algorithms on activity cliffs. We used classical machine learning methods\ncombined with common molecular descriptors and neural networks based on unstructured molecular data like molecular \ngraphs or SMILES strings. \n**Activity cliffs are molecules with small differences in structure but large differences in potency.** Activity cliffs\nplay an important role in drug discovery, but the bioactivity of activity cliff compounds are notoriously difficult to \npredict.  \n\nAny regression model can be evaluated on activity cliff performance using MoleculeACE on third party data or the 30\nincluded molecular bioactivity data sets. All 24 machine learning strategies covered in our benchmark study can be used \nout of the box. \n```python\nfrom MoleculeACE import MPNN, Data, Descriptors, calc_rmse, calc_cliff_rmse, get_benchmark_config\n\ndataset = 'CHEMBL2034_Ki'\ndescriptor = Descriptors.GRAPH\nalgorithm = MPNN\n\n# Load data\ndata = Data(dataset)\n\n# Get the already optimized hyperparameters\nhyperparameters = get_benchmark_config(dataset, algorithm, descriptor)\n\n# Featurize SMILES strings with a specific method\ndata(descriptor)\n\n# Train and a model\nmodel = algorithm(**hyperparameters)\nmodel.train(data.x_train, data.y_train)\ny_hat = model.predict(data.x_test)\n\n# Evaluate your model on activity cliff compounds\nrmse = calc_rmse(data.y_test, y_hat)\nrmse_cliff = calc_cliff_rmse(y_test_pred=y_hat, y_test=data.y_test, cliff_mols_test=data.cliff_mols_test)\n\nprint(f\"rmse: {rmse}\")\nprint(f\"rmse_cliff: {rmse_cliff}\")\n``` \n<h3 id=\"eval-own-model\"> Evaluate the performance of your own model</h3> \nExposing the Limitations of Molecular Machine Learning with Activity Cliffs.
