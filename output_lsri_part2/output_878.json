        "value": "**A suite of ImageJ and Micro-Manager scripts to perform intelligent imaging.** \nAutoScanJ is a suite of ImageJ scripts enabling to image targets of interest by automatically driving a motorized microscope (controlled by Micro-Manager or Leica LASAF with Matrix/CAM modules) at the corresponding locations. For live samples, the software can detect biological events from their onset and sequentially image them at high resolution, an action that would be impractical by user operation. For fixed samples, the software can dramatically reduce the amount of data acquired in situations where statistically few objects of interest are observed per field of view.  \nThe target detection function can be simply customized in ImageJ macro language and AutoScanJ can run directly on the microscope workstation, or on a dedicated image processing workstation connected to the same local network as the microscope workstation. In this latter case, the interaction is implemented as network socket-based messages and the images are shared by network folder (instead of a local folder).  \nThe concept of intelligent microscopy and sample applications corresponding to the different possible scenarios (fixed/live sample and tiled/block scans) is described in detail in the article [**AutoScanJ: A Suite of ImageJ Scripts for Intelligent Microscopy**](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2021.627626/abstract). \n**Usage of the test data** \n**For Fixed + Tiling experiments:**\n- Unzip the data that you want to test to an **empty** folder\n- Run the corresponding ImageJ macro and select the folder you unzipped the data to as experiment folder\n- Untick \"Perform primary scan\" and \"Send CAM scripts\" so that the macro does not attempt to re-acquire primary scan image by controlling the microscope\n- Select the Automatic pre-analysis function corresponding to the dataset you downloaded (**Glomerulus_detector** or **Metaphase_detector**)<br/>\n- Leave all other options to there default \nYou should see the primary scan map with the detected targets and the targets should be montaged in the QuickView window. It is not possible to go further with this demo and acquire secondary scan images since the microscope is not connected. Pressing OK twice in the next dialog boxes will bring the expected message \"The images from the CAM list cannot be found\" since no secondary scan images will be acquired. In a regular experiment with microscope connected, the targets should exclusively be edited from the Quick View window (if enabled in the initial dialog box), or from the primary scan map (if Quick View is not enabled).<br/> \nImages from the primary scan will be pulled peridoically from the first folder and copied to the experiment folder to mimick primary scan acquisition. Mitosis detections should be detected after few frames (as yellow circles overlaid on top of the primary map). No secondary images will be acquired and displayed since there is no connection to the microscope. \n"
