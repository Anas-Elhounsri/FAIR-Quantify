These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\n\n## How Can I Contribute?\n\n- Report bugs\n- Propose or implement features\n- Submit code changes / fixes\n- Discuss code\n\nSee here for a [short tutorial for GitHub's issue tracking\nsystem](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).\n\nPlease adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nPlease use the project's\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/panoptes-organization/panoptes/issues) to report bugs. If you have no experience in filing bug reports, see e.g.,\n[these recommendations by the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines)\nfirst. Briefly, it is important that bug reports contain enough detail,\nbackground and, if applicable, _minimal_ reproducible sample code. Tell us\nwhat you expect to happen, and what actually does happen.\n\n## Implementing features and submitting fixes\n\nKindly use pull requests to submit changes to the code base. But please note\nthat this project is driven by a community that likes to act on consensus. So\nin your own best interest, before just firing off a pull request after a lot of\nwork, please [open an issue](https://github.com/panoptes-organization/panoptes/issues)\nto **discuss your proposed changes first**. Afterwards, please stick to the\nfollowing simple rules to make sure your pull request will indeed be merged:\n\n\n1. Fork the repo and create a [_feature\n   branch_](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) from\n   branch `develop`\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n3. Ensure that all tests pass.\n4. Document your code and update all relevant documentation.\n5. Stick to the code and documentation style (see below).\n6. Issue the pull request.\n\nDon't forget to add your name and GitHub profile URL to the\n[list of contributors](contributors.md).\n\nImportant: Note that all your contributions are understood to be covered by the\n[same license](LICENSE.md) that covers the entire project.\n"

Such frameworks allow scientists to combine software and custom tools of different origin in a unified way, which lets them reproduce the results of others, or reuse the same pipeline on different datasets. One of the fundamental issues is that the majority of the users execute multiple pipelines at the same time, or execute a multistep pipeline for a big number of datasets, or both, making it hard to track the execution of the individual steps or monitor which of the processed datasets are complete. panoptes is a tool that monitors the execution of such workflows. \npanoptes is a service that can be used by:\n- Data scientists, bioinformaticians, etc. that want to have a general overview of the progress of their pipelines and the status of their jobs\n- Administrations that want to monitor their servers\n- Web developers that want to integrate the service in bigger web applications \n**Note:** panoptes is in early development stage and the first proof of concept server will support only workflows written in [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n \n"
