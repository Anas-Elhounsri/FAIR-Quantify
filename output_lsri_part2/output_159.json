        "value": "# Contributing to Vamb\nThe Git repository is currently hosted at https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb\n\n## Git workflow\nIn order for your contribution to be easily integrated into a package that is concurrently worked on by multiple people, it's important that you adhere to the Git workflow that we use for this repo.\n\n#### Feature branches\nWe never push directly to master. Instead, create a new feature branch on your own fork, and make a PR from your fork to master.\nFeature branches are any branch that contain new code that will eventually be merged to master, whether this is an actual feature, or a bugfix or whatever.\nWe recommend creating your feature branch from an updated version of master, to make it easier to merge into master again.\n\nFor large features, feature branches can contain huge changes, and be in development over months. Rebase on master as often as possible.\nHowever, where feasible, keep your feature branches' diff relative to master small. If your feature branch contain multiple independent changes, instead make multiple different PRs on different feature branches. This is easier to review, and to bisect if necessary.\n\nMake sure to squash your commits on your feature branches as necessary to keep the history clean.\nA good rule of thumb is that 1 commit = 1 PR, but there may be exceptions.\nAlso, please delete your feature branches after they've been merged to master so they don't accumulate.\n\n#### Release branches\nReleases are only cut from release branches.\nThe purpose of release branches is to keep a version of Vamb that is more stable than the development version found on master.\nThis stability is achieved by only adding bugfixes to release branches, not new features. Over time, the bugfixes will accumulate, while the new features (which mostly are where new bugs come from), are added to master only.\nRelease branches are named \"release\", plus the major and minor version, like so: \"release-4.1\". They are always cut from master.\nWe only backport bugfixes to one, or a few release branches at a time, so old release branches quickly get outdated. However, we will not remove them.\n\nRelease branches are never merged back to master. If commits from master are needed in a release branch, you may cherry-pick them from master.\nThis is the only case where commits may be duplicated on two different branches.\n\n#### Tags\nEach release of Vamb (from a release branch) is tagged with a lowercase \"v\", then a SemVer 2.0 version, e.g. \"v4.1.3\".\nA tag unambiguously refers to a commit, and is never removed.\nIdeally, the tagged commit should be the one that updates the version in `vamb/__init__.py`.\n\n#### Testing\nOur CI pipeline currently uses a formatter and a linter to check for issues (currently, the Ruff formatter and linter).\nTo quicken development time, you can install these locally so you can catch these issues before they are caught in CI.\n\n#### Dependencies\nPlease avoid adding new dependencies if at all practical.\nWe already have lots of issues with out dependencies, and don't want any more.\n\n## Example commands\nWe assume:\n    - The https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb repo is added as a remote with the name `upstream`\n    - Your own fork of Vamb is added as a remote called `origin`\n### Making an new PR\nSyncronize the master branches between your repo and upstream.\nDo this before making any new branches from master.\n```shell\n$ git switch master\n$ git pull upstream master\n$ git push origin master\n```\n\nMake a new branch, with a feature, here for example \"kmer-compression\".\nName your branch accordingly.\n```shell\n$ git switch -c kmer-compression\n```\n\nWrite your code, then test it.\nThis requires you to have installed Vamb (preferentially with `pip install -e .`),\nand installed `pytest` and `ruff`:\n```shell\n$ python -m pytest # test the code\n$ ruff check . # run the linter\n$ ruff format . # run the formatter\n```\n\nCommit it, then push to `origin`\n```shell\n$ git add * # add your files\n$ git status # check you didnt add spurious unneeded files\n$ git commit # then write a commit message\n$ git push -u origin kmer-compression\n```\n\nNavigate to Vamb's GitHub repo (the `upstream` one), then on the Pull Requests tab make a new PR from `kmer-compression`\nto `upstream`'s master.\n"

[Article](TODO).\n  TaxVamb produces superior bins, but requires you have run a taxonomic annotation workflow. \nAnd a taxonomy predictor:\n* __Taxometer__: This tool refines arbitrary taxonomy predictions (e.g. from `mmseqs taxonomy`) using kmer composition and co-abundance.

        "description": "# Vamb 4.0.0\r\nVersion 4 is a thorough rewrite of major parts of Vamb that has taken more than a year.\r\nVamb now ships with with an upgraded dual variational autoencoder (VAE) and\r\nadversatial autoencoder (AAE) model, usable in a CheckM based workflow.\r\nThe code quality and test suite has gotten significant upgrades, making Vamb\r\nmore stable and robust to bugs.\r\nVamb version is slightly faster and produces better bins than v3.\r\nThe user interface has gotten limited changes.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* The official API of Vamb is now defined only in terms of its command-line\r\n  interface. This means that from now on, Vamb can freely change and modify its\r\n  internal functions, even in minor releases or patch releases.\r\n  If you are using Vamb as a Python package, it means you should precisely\r\n  specify the full version of Vamb used in order to ensure reproducibility.\r\n* Benchmark procedure has been changed, so benchmark results are incompatible\r\n  with results from v3. Benchmarking is now considered an implementation detail,\r\n  and is not stable across releases.\r\n* Vamb no longer outputs TNF, sequence names and sequence lengths as .npz files.\r\n  Instead, it produces a `composition.npz` that contains all this information\r\n  and more.\r\n  As a consequence command-line options `--tnfs`, `--names` and `--lengths`\r\n  have been removed, and replaced with the single `--composition` option.\r\n* The output .npz array `rpkm.npz` has been changed in a backwards incompatible\r\n  way. From version 4, the content of the output .npz files are considered an\r\n  implementation detail.\r\n* The depths input option `--jgi` has been removed. To use depths computed by\r\n  an external program, construct an instance of the `Abundance` class from your\r\n  depths and save it using its `.save` method to an `rpkm.npz` file.\r\n  (though read the Notable changes section below).\r\n  \r\n### New features\r\n* Vamb now included an optional AAE model along the VAE model.\r\n  Users may run the VAE model, where it behaves similarly to v3, or run the mixed\r\n  VAE/AAE model, in which both models will be run on the same dataset.\r\n* The Snakemake workflow has been rehauled, and how defaults to using\r\n  the VAE/AAE combined model, using CheckM to dereplicate.\r\n* Vamb is now more easily installed via pip: `pip install vamb`. We have fixed\r\n  a bunch of issues that caused installation problems.\r\n* By default, Vamb gzip compresses FASTA files written using the `--minfasta`\r\n  flag.\r\n\r\n### Notable other changes\r\n* Using the combined VAE-AAE workflow, the user can get significantly better bins.\r\n* Vamb now uses `CoverM` internally to calculate abundances. This means it is\r\n  significantly faster and more accurate than before.\r\n  Thus, we no longer recommend users computing depths with MetaBAT2's JGI tool.\r\n* Lots of bugfixes may have changed Vamb's behaviour in a backwards incompatible\r\n  way for certain edge cases. For example, FASTA identifiers are now required to\r\n  match the name specification in the SAM format to ensure the identifiers are\r\n  the same in FASTA and BAM files.\r\n",

        "description": "# Vamb 3.0\r\n## Highlights\r\n  * new `--minfasta` command line option, which, when set, causes Vamb to output any bins with more nucleotides than this number.\r\n  * TNFs are now projected to 103 linearly independent dimensions, saving memory and time, as well as improving VAE training.\r\n  * Clustering hyperparameters have been optimized further, improving binning accuracy.\r\n  * Benchmarking higher clades have changed and is now simpler to understand.\r\n\r\n#### Changes in behaviour:\r\n  * TNFs are now automatically projected down to 103 linearly independent axes as done in Kislyuk et al. 2009, BMC Bioinformatics. This saves RAM and increases VAE training speed. As a result, all TNFs are now a Nx103 matrix down from a Nx136 matrix.\r\n  * Clustering is now done by a `ClusterGenerator` object, which contains the clustering state. This object can be queried for its state and manipulated much transparently than the previous generator.\r\n  * A `ClusterGenerator` object returns `Cluster` objects containing the cluster itself as well as some metadata.\r\n  * `ClusterGenerator` have different hyperparameters than the old cluster generators, and is slightly more accurate. As a result, the clusters generated have changed.\r\n  * Benchmarking of higher clades have been changed. Previously, the precision of a higher clade was defined as the recall of covered nucleotides belonging to the genomes of that clade. Now, a clade is recovered at a given threshold iff any member of it is.\r\n  * Cluster names in `clusters.tsv` are now more legible\r\n\r\n#### New scripts:\r\n  * src/concatenate.py: Concatenates and renames FASTA files to FASTA catalogue\r\n  * src/create_kernel: Recreates kernel.npz. To be used as documentation.\r\n\r\n#### New functions or classes:\r\n  * `vambtools.PushArray`: Data structure that allows efficient appending and extending a 1D Numpy array. Intended to strike a balance between not resizing too often (which is slow), and not allocating too much at a time (which is memory inefficient)\r\n  * `cluster.ClusterGenerator` and `cluster.Cluster`, see below for details.\r\n  * You can now close a `Reader` with `reader.close()` and iterate it like other file handles.\r\n\r\n#### Removed functions:\r\n  * `vambtools.zeros`\r\n  * `vambtools.FastaEntry.fourmer_freq`\r\n\r\n#### Moved functions:\r\n  * `read_clusters` from `cluster` to `vambtools`.\r\n  * `write_clusters` from `cluster` to `vambtools`.\r\n\r\n#### Misc:\r\n  * Minimum sequence length (`-m` option in command line) is now printed in log file.\r\n  * Optimizations have made the `preallocate` keyword in function `parsecontigs.read_contigs` obsolete, and it has been removed. It is now always both fast and memory efficient.\r\n  * No longer warns when used on fewer than 50,000 contigs.\r\n  * Various small bug fixes.\r\n  * Various optimizations have improved running time and memory use.\r\n",

It will not rename clusters if set to False.\r\nvambtools.loadfasta and vambtools.write_bins now has keywords \"compress\" and \"compressed\" (False by default), which causes sequences to be stored in compressed form.\r\nparsebam.read_bamfiles now takes argument refhash, which shold be None or md5 hash that the references must hash to.\r\nArgument minlength can now consistently be passed as None in functions of module parsebam, similar to the other filtering parameters.\r\nbenchmark.Contig is no longer immutable, and can now be desrialized using pickle.\r\n\r\n## Misc:\r\nImproved validation of command line options\r\nNow handles whitespace in FASTA sequences (tabs, and spaces only)\r\nIncreased numerical stability in RPKM estimation\r\nNumerous documentation and performance improvements\r\nNow warns user that VAE may overfit if less than 50,000 contigs are kept.\r\nOutput cluster names are now more legible and contains information about pre-binsplit cluster.\r\n",

        "description": "# Vamb version 2\r\n\r\nFor this release, we have made significant changes to both the user-facing API and the internals.\r\nThe new API attempts to be more flexible and user-friendly, and the internal changes should make\r\nVamb perform better across a wider range of input datasets.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n* Vamb should now be installed using pip.\r\n* The estimation of RPKM is now more accurate.\r\n* Vamb now allows encoding of single-sample datasets.\r\n* Clustering algorithm fundamentally changed.\r\n* Benchmarking algorithm fundamentally changed.\r\n\r\n### Now installable via pip\r\n* Binaries are no longer part of the package. These are instead automatically compiled using Cython upon installation.\r\n* Installing automatically installs Numpy, pysam and PyTorch if not installed already.\r\n* Installation enforces Python >= 3.5.\r\n* Installing via pip now adds the module to your $PATH so it can more easily be used from command line.\r\n\r\n### Changes to RPKM estimation\r\n* A BAM file with no reads now returns a depth of all zeros instead of all NaNs.\r\n* The BAM parser no longer attempts to detect and filter away duplicate alignments erroneously produced by some aligners.\r\n* Reads without a mapping mate are now consistently counted as half a read when estimating RPKM.\r\n* Reads with N total subjects count as 1/N instead of 1 towards each subject.\r\n* Vamb no longer parses the XA-tags produced by BWA.\r\n* All alignments not marked as primary are now skipped.\r\n* Minimum alignment score now works as expected when set below 1. Set to None in order to disable the filtering.\r\n* Default minimum alignment score is now None instead of 50.\r\n* Exceptions raised in subprocesses now propagate properly to the parent process and ends Vamb.\r\n\r\n### Vamb now allows encoding of single-sample datasets\r\n* When encoding a dataset with a single sample, the abundance loss uses sum of squared error, and does not softmax.\r\n* Vamb now performs well on single-sample compared to MetaBAT2.\r\n\r\n### New clustering algorithm\r\n* Now uses cosine distance instead of Pearson distance.\r\n* Clustering threshold is estimated for each cluster while running instead of beforehand.\r\n* The new approach is significantly slower, but more accurate.\r\n* cluster.read_clusters now doesn\u2019t crash when reading an empty line.\r\n* Inputs are now shuffled in-place to reduce memory consumption.\r\n\r\n### New benchmarking algorithm\r\n* Now calculates recall and precision based on the total number of basepairs of the underlying genome covered by contigs in the bins.\r\n* Changed the interface and required input files.\r\n* Now accepts non-disjoint bins\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n* Vamb now optionally accepts a .npz files of TNF, sequence names and sequence lengths instead of a FASTA file.\r\n* Vamb can now parse depths information from BAM files, from a .npz file, or from the output of MetaBAT2's jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths\r\n* Contig parser now checks that the header contains no tab characters.\r\n* Vamb now transparently accepts FASTA files zipped with gzip, bzip2 and LZMA.\r\n* The mask is now saved in the output directory as mask.npz.\r\n* The order of the columns in the RPKM array is now printed in the log file.\r\n",
