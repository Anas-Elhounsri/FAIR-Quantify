Although deep learning methods have been proposed to diagnose POAG, these methods all used a single image as input. Differently, the glaucoma specialists compare the follow-up image with the baseline image to determine a glaucomatous eye. To simulate this process, we proposed a siamese network model, POAGNet, to identify POAG from fundus photographs. \n \n"
