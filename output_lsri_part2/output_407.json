        "value": "PyMIC is a pytorch-based toolkit for medical image computing with annotation-efficient deep learning. Despite that pytorch is a fantastic platform for deep learning, using it for medical image computing is not straightforward as medical images are often with high dimension and large volume, multiple modalities and difficulies in annotating. This toolkit is developed to facilitate medical image computing researchers so that training and testing deep learning models become easier. It is very friendly to researchers who are new to this area. Even without writing any code, you can use PyMIC commands to train and test a model by simply editing configuration files.  PyMIC is developed to support learning with imperfect labels, including semi-supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised learning, and learning with noisy annotations. \nCurrently PyMIC supports 2D/3D medical image classification and segmentation, and it is still under development. If you use this toolkit, please cite the following paper: \n* G. Wang, X. Luo, R. Gu, S. Yang, Y. Qu, S. Zhai, Q. Zhao, K. Li, S. Zhang.

For advanced users, you can customize different modules (networks, loss functions, training pipeline, etc) and easily integrate them into PyMIC.\n* Easy-to-use I/O interface to read and write different 2D and 3D images.\n* Various data pre-processing/transformation methods before sending a tensor into a network.\n* Implementation of typical neural networks for medical image segmentation.\n* Re-useable training and testing pipeline that can be transferred to different tasks.\n* Evaluation metrics for quantitative evaluation of your methods. \n \n"
