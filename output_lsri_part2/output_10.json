The genome is broken into haplotypes of variable size sampled from a distribution centered around a mean that the user can pass as a parameter (--mean-haplotype-size). Each haplotype is assigned a divergence rate. The divergence is variable, and like the haplotype size, is sampled from a distribution centered around the one declared in --divergence. Then, based on the fraction of --loh declared by the user, some of these haplotypes are assigned divergence = 0. Then, the algorithm adjusts the divergence rate of the non-LOH haplotypes to bring the total average back to --divergence. Finally, random mutations are introduced in each haplotype based on their assigned divergence rate.\r\n- Added GPL3.0 licence ",

These values are useful to set as thresholds in JLOH extract, so it produces an estimation of which parameters would fit the best.

The value goes from 0 to 1, where e.g. 0.01 is 1% divergence.
