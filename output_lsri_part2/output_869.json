Means that working with continuous data is now much easier.\r\n\r\n* Cleaned up function used for prepping tree prior to plotting an output example with ggtree.\r\n\r\n* Re-organized output of `POMS_pipeline` (e.g., object names are simplified and more information is provided by default without having to specify detailed_output)\r\n\r\n* Added unit tests\r\n\r\n* Added in documentation for exported functions\r\n\r\n* Simplified terminology and made sure it was consistent through-out (especially in terms of BSNs and FSNs)\r\n\r\n* Removed unused functions\r\n\r\n* Minor clean-ups to code, mainly to make it easier to read\r\n",
