        "value": "\nThe *Quanty-cFOS.ijm* is an ImageJ/Fiji tool developed to count specifically Fos/*c-fos* labelled cells in fixed brain slices or more generally to count cell markers in 2D fluorescent images or on Maximum Intensity Projections (MIP) in an unbiased manner. For flexibility reasons this tool is implemented as a macro-set (IJ1) for Image/Fiji (tested on version 1.53s and above) \n1.  ***[StarDist 2D](https://imagej.net/StarDist)***: ImageJ/Fiji plugin based on the *Versatile* (Fluorescent-Nuclei) inference applied on the raw images. The model can be easily customized by training your own StarDist Neural Network and imported in ImageJ/Fiji. Please check the StarDist Jupyter Notebook\n2.  ***[ilastik Pixel Classification Workflow](https://www.ilastik.org/documentation/pixelclassification/pixelclassification)***: The probability map can be generated using the *Pixel Classification* workflow in the *ilastik* software (open source) and loaded in addition to the raw images. The probability map is thresholded and used as an input for the cell counting \nThe user can decide which method is more suitable to process the input raw images. It is recommended to start with the StarDist 2D *Versatile* model and switch to the ilastik pixel classification workflow only if the detection is not accurate enough or the structures of interest are not convex \nThe workflow consists of two major steps:  \nFos/*c-fos* staining is known to work differently depending on many experimental factors that might include fixation, antibody type and batch, section thickness... Fos/*c-fos* neurons manual count is extremely time consuming and can differ depending on the decision criteria in particular when is performed manually by visually annotating cells. Fos/*c-fos* automated intensity count can be used to significantly speed up the counting process and further reduce human counts bias \nThe automated count algorithm computes the mean intensity value and the mean intensity standard deviation of each single segmented cell in the images, averages these two values and computes the z-score (Z) \n\n*where:*\t![xi_1645613569](static/xi_1645613569.jpg)is the single cell intensity\n\t\t\t   ![mu_1645613934](static/mu_1645613934.jpg) is the mean cell intensity computed on the population\n\t\t\t   ![sigma_1645613989](static/sigma_1645613989.jpg) is the mean cell intensity standard deviation computed on the population \nThe user can input the range of standard deviations (*sigma*) to decide the optimal cutoff for Fos/*c-fos* cells count. The cutoff optimization is critical to gain an accurate and robust cells' number estimation. To properly calculate the mean intensity and standard deviation values used for the cutoff the user can specify an arbitrary number of images, compute these values and let the tool process all the other images in a more robust way (see *Batch Analysis* with *Optimization Steps*). To validate how the automated intensity method correlates with human counts, we suggest to manually count cells in few images and run the MATLAB correlation analysis provided with the Quanty-cFOS (`\\validation\\CorrelationAnalysis.mlx`, see also the ValidationTable.xlsx file as an example). The manual counts can be performed using your favorite tool or by running the following IJ1 script developped to [validate this method](https://github.com/cberri/cFOS_ManualAnnotations_ImageJ-Fiji) \n"

Old version of ImageJ/Fiji can output different error messages. If this is the case, please update ImageJ/Fiji to the latest version or download and install the latest release  \n   - In case of large images increase the *StarDist Tails Number* \n   - *Batch Analysis* and *Optimization Steps* allow to decide how many images will interactively pop up to the user and in case of *Automated Optimization* (see below), the number of images used to compute the intensity threshold cutoff for Fos/*c-fos* positive and negative cells. A recommendation for starting is to leave the box unchecked and proceed to the next step by clicking the *OK* button \n5. The *Input Dialog Box* pops up and the user can specify the input directory with the raw images to process. The input raw images need to have one channel as MIP or z-stacks. In case of a z-stack, the Quanty-cFOS computes the MIP and starts the 2D cell segmentation. To get familiar with the Quanty-cFOS tool you can use the sample images provided together with the tool (`\\samples`) \n7. Press *OK*, the first image will be processed and the *User Input Setting Window* pops up again, every time a new image is processed. To automate further the counting and do not display the *User Input Setting* dialog box for each image the user can choose in the *Main Setting Windows* the *Batch Analysis* and set the *Optimization Steps* to the number of images needed to compute the intensity cutoff (*e.g.:* 10 *Optimization Steps* =  first 10 Images are used to compute the intensity cutoff) \n8. The Quanty-cFOS output is a folder with sub-folders for each raw image processed. Each sub-folder has the same name of the input image and contains: \n   - A *csv* file with the Center of Mass of each detected cell (X, Y, ID, State)\n   - A labeled image that displays in yellow the Fos/*c-fos* positive cells (ID 255) and in purple the cells counted as negative (ID 50)\n   - The RoiManager ROIs with Fos/*c-fos* positive and negative cells highlighted (see User Input Setting RoiManager ROIs Tag function in the Help)\n   - By selecting the *Batch Analysis* an additional folder named *LabeledImages* is created. This folder contains all the segmented cells as labeled images for Fos/*c-fos* positive (pixel value 255) and negative (pixel value 50). The idea is to help the user with the next steps of the analysis by collecting all the outputs in one single directory \n9. The summary counts are saved in the main directory in the *SummaryMeasurements.cs*v file (tab separator) and the *Log.txt* file contains the user settings used for the analysis. The Log file can be used to document your analysis steps and for instance added in your favorite electronic lab-book  \n"
