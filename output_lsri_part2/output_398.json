        "value": "Many complex phenotypes are highly polygenic, making a large number of associated genetic variants fail to be discovered in GWAS. Evidence shows that associated variants are enriched in some functional annotations, which offers us an opportunity to increase the statistical power of large-scale multiple testing by properly leveraging these auxiliary information. Existing methods for integrating functional annotations with GWAS results have limitations: (1) most of the existing methods assume a linear model for risk variant identification; (2) few of existing methods are scalable to handle a large number of annotations while maintaining good interpretability.\n\nIn this work, we proposed a novel statistical method to better utilize functional annotations in risk variants prioritization. Specifially, we assume the p-values from GWAS summary statistics follow a two-groups model with SNP-specific priors; we model the SNP-specific priors in the logit scale using boosted trees. An EM algorithm was developed to simultaneously optimize model parametes and add trees in a stagewise fashion such that annotations are adaptively incorporated into the model. The merits of boosted trees transplant to PALM: not only does it allow complex relationship between functional annotations and SNP association status but also automatically selects important annotations which provides some biological insights. Simulation studies and real data analysis illustrated PALM's superior performance on risk variants prioritization compared with existing representative methods and its effectiveness in identifying enriched cell-type/tissue specific annotations.\n"

A demo on simulated data with network-based model can be found [here](https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/PALM/blob/main/demos/demo_nn.ipynb).  \nAfter conducting some simulations, we found that the performance of network-based model was sensitive to the network design and hyperparameters tuning (at least for the very simple multi-layer perceptron). Since network-based model is not robust in FDR control, we haven't applied it to real data. For risk variant prioritization, currently we suggest tree-based models. Further research is needed for the potential usage of neural network in genomic integrative analysis. \n"

        "value": "The main script `prioritize.py` will add two columns `post` and `assoc` to the input GWAS file and save as the new dataframe as the prioritization result. `post` represents the posterior probability of one SNP being associated with the phenotype given its p-value and annotations; `assoc` represents the SNP association status under a certain FDR control level (by default, 0.1). Besides, a file recording the log-likelihoods on test folds and a file recording computational times will be saved. And if specified, the estimated &alpha; in the two-groups model and the evaluated variable importance will be saved as well.\n\nAn example of the major output file:\n\n``` shell\n$ head Bipolar_Disorder-J2-v0.1-PALM-tree-prioritize.csv\nSNP\tCHR\tBP\tMAF\tA1\tA2\tpvalue\tpost\tassoc\nrs10907175\t1\t1130727\t0.084493\tA\tC\t0.351999999999945\t0.2459430394857876\t0.0\nrs2887286\t1\t1156131\t0.175944\tT\tC\t0.390399999999947\t0.21100387604316348\t0.0\nrs6685064\t1\t1211292\t0.0666004\tC\tT\t0.943799999999981\t0.10466973830102834\t0.0\nrs1571150\t1\t1474304\t0.333002\tC\tA\t0.667700000000157\t0.312529201925508\t0.0\nrs7290\t1\t1477244\t0.306163\tT\tC\t0.847799999999996\t0.22741445464179644\t0.0\nrs3766180\t1\t1478153\t0.306163\tT\tC\t0.852900000000085\t0.2170770906036481\t0.0\nrs3766178\t1\t1478180\t0.306163\tT\tC\t0.801899999999967\t0.2209031523383583\t0.0\nrs7533\t1\t1479333\t0.306163\tA\tG\t0.85810000000001\t0.1511410932793709\t0.0\nrs7517401\t1\t1483010\t0.349901\tG\tA\t0.700699999999828\t0.21465550994232505\t0.0\n```\n"
