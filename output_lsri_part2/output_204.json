        "value": "Variant classification is a manual complex long process that combines information of distinct nature. An accurate classification is necessary to ensure proper genetic counselling and personalised risk estimation. \nIn 2015, the American College of Molecular Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) together with the Association of Molecular Pathologists published generic guidelines to standardize and provide an objective framework to evaluate variant pathogenicity in Mendelian disease.\nLater, specific guidelines have been published for some genes by collaborative groups. \n\n`vaRHC` has been developed to automate as much as possible the process of variant classification in hereditary cancer.\nIt follows gene-specific guidelines for *APC*, *ATM*, *CDH1*, *CHEK2*, *MLH1*, *MSH2*, *MSH6*, *PALB2*, *PMS2*, *PTEN* and *TP53*, and the updated general ACMG/AMP rules for other cancer susceptibility genes. The final classification is obtained according to Tavtigian\u2019s natural scoring Bayesian-based metastructure (Tavtigian et al., 2020) but also considering some of the proposed CanVIG-UK incompatibilities.\n\nThe current version of the package works for single substitutions, deletions and insertions up to 25 bp, intronic variants and 5\u2019 or 3\u2019-UTR variants 25 bp.\n"
