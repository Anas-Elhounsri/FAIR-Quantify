Changepoints for a Range of Penalties (CROPS) [[2]](#2) helps by efficiently running PELT for many different penalty values. However, an investigator may need to look through many different results from running CROPS on PELT to find a \"best fit\" for their data. \nAutomated Selection of Changepoints using Empirical P-values and Trimming (ASCEPT) [[3]](#3) makes this process easier by selecting changepoints from PELT based on their statistical significance in improving a model fit to the data. It then allows the user to trim the set of changepoints of false positives that may arise due to linear trends or seasonality in the data. \n"

        "value": "Having installed and loaded the ``changepointSelect`` package, we can now run ASCEPT on series of observations. Consider the [simulated time series](data/simSeries.RData) available within the package.\n\n![Figure 1](man/figures/Sim_results1.png \"Simulated Data\")\n\nWe notice sudden mean-shifts in the observations at indices 49, 60, 600, 699, and 700 (note that a changepoint is defined to be the point immediately before the shift occurs). Additionally, there is a linear trend from indices 200 to 400 and seasonality from 400 to 600. Let us run the first stage of ASCEPT, which selects changepoints from running CROPS on PELT based on a Monte Carlo experiment and a significance level. In this case, we use 10,000 simulations, or trials, and a significance level of 0.01. Note that the simulated data is loaded in as ``simSeries`` when using the package. We run this command in parallel using 2 cores. In general, we recommend running in parallel using, on the order of, 2-4 cores. This should often provide a substantial speedup over serial computation.\n\n```r\nsimChangepoints <- getChangepoints(series=simSeries, alpha=0.01, numTrials=10000, serial=F, numCores = 2)\n```\n\nWe find that we select the following changepoints initially.\n![Figure 2](man/figures/Sim_results2.png \"Simulated Data\")\n\nClearly, we have many proposed changepoints that arise due to the linear trend and the seasonal pattern. To account for these false positives, we should trim this initial set of changepoints. We do so using the ``trimChangepoints()`` function. We pass it the simulated data, the initial set of changepoints, and thresholds for when to trim a changepoint. We determine whether or not to trim a changepoint by fitting a few different models. We fit piecewise linear and harmonic models on each segment adjacent to the changepoint and compare those to cross-segment linear and harmonic models that ignore the changepoint. If the ratio of the RMSE for the best cross-segment fit to the RMSE for the best piecewise fit is below the trimming threshold (i.e. ignoring the changepoint doesn't impact the linear or harmonic regression's goodness-of-fit that much), then the changepoint is subject to being removed.\n\nIn order to trim changepoints for both linear trends and seasonality, ``thresholdLinear`` and ``thresholdSeaonal`` must both be larger than 1. If  ``thresholdLinear > 1`` and  ``thresholdSeasonal <= 1``, then the changepoints will only be trimmed for linear trends. If  ``thresholdLinear <= 1`` and  ``thresholdSeasonal > 1``, then the changepoints will only be trimmed for seasonality. However, it is generally recommended to trim for both linear trends and seasonality. Thresholds between 1 and 1.5 seem to be reasonable, but the investigator is encouraged to try multiple values since the utility of a given value will depend on how extreme mean-shifts are relative to the surrounding observations. Here, we use thresholds of 1.2 for both linear trends and seasonality.\n\n```r\nsimChangepointsTrimmed <- trimChangepoints(series=simSeries, changepoints=simChangepoints, thresholdLinear=1.2, thresholdSeasonal=1.2)\n```\n\nWe find that we are left with the following changepoints.\n\n![Figure 3](man/figures/Sim_results3.png \"Simulated Data\")\n\nIn this particular case, the trimming works very well. We are left with the correct changepoints reflecting major mean-shifts, and have effectively segmented off the linear trend and seasonal pattern. Of course, the investigator should bear in mind that results will vary depending on the context, again emphasizing the importance of trying multiple threshold values. These procedures of initially selecting and then trimming changepoints are the primary functions of the ``changepointSelect`` package.\n\nAfter identifying changepoints, an investigator would typically want to correct or adjust the data for these changepoints. Often, this may entail an approach like recording which observations fall into which segment, and then controlling for those segments in a regression analysis. Here, we will instead perform a relatively simple correction method as a brief example. After identifying changepoints, we can determine whether a segment is best modeled by a constant (i.e. mean) model, a linear model, or a harmonic model using the ``getBestFitBySegment()`` function. In our approach, a linear or harmonic regression is deemed the best fit to a segment only if the ratio of the constant fit's RMSE to the best corresponding linear regression or harmonic regression's RMSE is greater than a \"fitting threshold\". This fitting threshold is similar to the trimming threshold discussed before. However, instead of comparing cross-segment linear and harmonic models to piecewise linear and harmonic models, we are now comparing linear and harmonic models for a single segment to the constant (i.e. mean) model for that segment. In this example, we choose a fitting threshold of 1.75 for both linear and harmonic models. As with the trimming threshold, an investigator may want to assess the impact of different fitting thresholds if they choose to use this function.\n\n```r\nbestFits <- getBestFitBySegment(series=simSeries, changepoints=simChangepointsTrimmed, thresholdLinear=1.75, thresholdSeasonal=1.75, plotFits=T)\n```\n\n![Figure 4](man/figures/Sim_results_best_fit.png \"Simulated Data\")\n\nIf a linear model fits best, we can de-trend the segment. If a harmonic model fits best, we can de-seasonalize the model. We can then take these residuals and both shift and scale them to match the mean and standard deviation of a chosen reference segment. After doing this using `` basicSegmentCorrection()``, if the changepoints were appropriately identified, we should not expect to see any remaining sudden mean-shifts, linear trends, or seasonality. Bear in mind that this procedure, while available in the package, is not meant to replace more rigorous approaches for segment correction. It is primarily offered as a preliminary means of assessing how well changepoints were identified.\n\n```r\ncorrectedSeries <- basicSegmentCorrection(series=simSeries, changepoints=simChangepointsTrimmed, bestFitsBySegment = bestFits, referenceSegment = 5, plotResults = T)\n```\n\n![Figure 5](man/figures/Sim_results_corrected.png \"Simulated Data\")\n\n"
