These large datasets for protein structures leads to hugh hard disk comsumptions. For example, the full AlphaFold DB release in year 2022 has 23 TB of data, which is expected to continuously increase. To address the data storage issue, the PDC package aims to convert full atomic PDB and mmCIF format protein structure models to and from the highly compressed .pdc format, which is specifically designed for AlphaFold predicted protein structures.\n"

        "value": "PDC decrease the size of protein coordinate files in PDB or mmCIF format through the following three approaches:\n1. Removal of repetitive information among different atoms, such as the chain ID and residue index.\n2. Use [int](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer) and ``char`` instead of ``string`` to store coordinates and B-factors.\n   Specifically, since xyz and bfactor can be expressed as %8.3f and %6.2f, they are in the range of -999.999 to 9999.999 and -99.99 to 999.99, respectively. This means that they can be expressed as integers in the range of 0 to 10999998 and 0 to 109998, respectively, both of which can be stored by unint32.\n3. Delta encoding: store the difference in coordinate/bfactor from the previous value rather than the actual value, which is can be stored by int16 or int8.\n4. Under lossy compression mode, store the torsion angles rather than the coordinates.\n \n"
