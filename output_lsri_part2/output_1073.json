Install the Conda package for your system. The installation of the package can be found <a href=\"https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html\">here</a>. \n\n2. Create the YTLR Conda environment. This may take a while, depending on the network status.\n\n```\nconda create -n \"YTLR\" python=3.8.5\n```\n\n3. Activate your YTLR Conda environment. \n\n```\nconda activate YTLR\n```\n\n4. If you are using APPLE MAC systems, please install wget first:\n\n```\nbrew install wget\n``` \n\nIf you are using Microsoft Windows systems, please install wget first:\n\n```\nconda install -c menpo wget\n``` \n\n5. If you want to leave the YTLR Conda envrionment, please type:\n\n```\nconda deactivate YTLR\n```\n\n6. **Notice!** Because the PMC FTP service will be updated daily, we recommend executing the following command before using YTLR functions.\n \n``` python update_PMC_xml.py```\n\n"

        "value": "1. Download the codes. Please skip this if you have already downloaded the codes.\n\n```\nwget https://cobis.bme.ncku.edu.tw/YTLR/YTLR.tar.gz\n```\n\n2. Unzip the file.\n\n```\ntar -zxvf YTLR.tar.gz\n```\n\n3. Change the working directory.\n\n```\ncd YTLR/\n```\n\n4. Download the model from the following link and unzip the file. Please skip it if you have done this step.\n\n```\nwget https://cobis.bme.ncku.edu.tw/YTLR/Model.tar.gz\n\ntar zxvf Model.tar.gz\n```\n\n5. If this is the first time you use YTLR, run the following command to install the necessary packages. \n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\npython -m spacy download en_core_web_trf 3.2.0\n```\n\nIf the second command fails, try below:\n\n```\npip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_trf-3.2.0/en_core_web_trf-3.2.0.tar.gz\n```\n\nNotice that if you have GPU support in your system, you can activate the GPU support in YTLR by the following command:\n\n```\nconda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=<version> -c pytorch\n```\n\nRemember to specify the current version of your cuda GPU support. \n\n6. Prepare the inputs for YTLR. In YTLR, users can input a list of abstracts downloaded using the PubMed download function. \n    >***HOW TO GET ABSTRACTS FROM PubMed***\n    >>1. Search the PubMed website for specific keywords to obtain the lists of articles. \n    >>2. Select the abstracts of interest or select all abstracts in the page. \n    >>3. Click the ***save*** button.\n    >>4. Choose the ***Abstract(text)***.\n    >>5. The .txt file containing all the abstracts will be downloaded.\n    >>![](https://i.imgur.com/36LDa3P.png)\n\n\n7. (Optional) Users can specify the full-texts of the selected abstracts by themselves. However, this is an optional step. YTLR can also help retrieve the available PMC full-texts using the PMC FTP service (Detail can be found <a href =\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/ftp/\">here</a>). \n\n    >***HOW TO GET FULL TEXT FROM PMC***\n    >>1. Browse the PubMed website(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) and choose the paper you want.\n    >>2. You can get the full content of the website by using the right mouse button and clicking \"save as new file\" to save it as an HTML file. \n\n8. Put the abstract .txt file and the full-text .html files in the same input folder.  \n\n   We have provided an example input folder named \"small_input.\"\n      \n   **SAMPLE INPUT**\n   \n    ```\n    sample_input/ - abstracts.txt\n                  - PMC165726.html\n                  - PMC5469029.html\n\n    .txt --> abstracts downloaded from PubMed (only abstract)\n    .html --> full-texts downloaded from PMC (optional)\n    ```\n\n9. Run YTLR and predict the results. The results will be saved in the output folder specified with the -o parameter. The program will download some essential data on the first use.\n```\npython main.py -i <path to input directory> -d <tfb/tfr/both> -check <0/1> -download <0/1> -o <path to the output directory>\n```\n\n>**Required arguments:**\n\n>* -i: The input data directory path.\n\n>* -d: Specify the type of TF-gene association to consider ('tfb', 'tfr', or 'both', default = 'both').\n\n>* -check: Check if the article relates to the yeast species (1 --> check, 0 -> do not check, default = 1).\n\n>* -download: Check if the user wants to use the auto full text retrieval script based on the PMC FTP service (1 -> yes, 0 -> no, default = 1).\n\n\n>* -o: The output directory for the results. \n\n\n**Notice!**\n\n***It may take a while (generally, half an hour to several hours, depending on the network bandwidth and the number of articles given) to download the full texts using the PMC ftp services due to its file package structures. We do not suggest using wifi connections for this automated script since the download process may break in wifi transmissions.***\n\n***And due to the restriction of the term usage of the PMC ftp services, only part of the full texts in PMC can be downloaded via this service. Those articles that cannot be downloaded through the PMC ftp services may require an additional PMC website \"Save as...\" action for each of them. ***\n"

Induction of meiosis in budding yeasts in response to nutrient levels provides a system to investigate the molecular basis of cellular decision-making. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, entry into meiosis depends on multiple signals converging upon IME1, the master transcriptional activator of meiosis. Here we studied the regulation of the cis-acting regulatory element Upstream Activation Signal (UAS)ru, which resides within the IME1 promoter. Guided by our previous data acquired using a powerful high-throughput screening system, here we provide evidence that UASru is regulated by multiple stimuli that trigger distinct signal transduction pathways as follows: (i) The glucose signal inhibited UASru activity through the cyclic AMP (cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, targeting the transcription factors (TFs), Com2 and Sko1; (ii) high osmolarity activated UASru through the Hog1/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and its corresponding TF Sko1; (iii) elevated temperature increased the activity of UASru through the cell wall integrity pathway and the TFs Swi4/Mpk1 and Swi4/Mlp1; (iv) the nitrogen source repressed UASru activity through Sum1; and (v) the absence of a nitrogen source was detected and transmitted to UASru by the Kss1 and Fus3 MAPK pathways through their respective downstream TFs, Ste12/Tec1 and Ste12/Ste12 as well as by their regulators Dig1/2. These signaling events were specific to UASru; they did not affect the mating and filamentation response elements that are regulated by MAPK pathways. The complex regulation of UASru through all the known vegetative MAPK pathways is unique to S. cerevisiae and is specific for IME1, likely because it is the master regulator of gametogenesis.     Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) ChIP assays were performed essentially as described [10].\n```\n\n>**Column descriptions:**\n\n>* PMID: PubMed ID of the article.\n>* Evidence: TFB/TFR article, if it contains TFB/TFR evidence; non-TFB//non-TFR article, if it does not describe TFB or TFR evidence.\n>* Abstract: abstract of the paper.\n>* Experiment Description: The sentence that may contain information of the experiment carried out in this research.\n\neg. non-TFB_articles.txt\n\n```\nPMID    Evidence    Abstract\n10940042    non-TFB article    The phenotype of an organism is the manifestation of its expressed genome. The gcr1 mutant of yeast grows at near wild-type rates on nonfermentable carbon sources but exhibits a severe growth defect when grown in the presence of glucose, even when nonfermentable carbon sources are available. Using DNA microarrays, the genomic expression patterns of wild-type and gcr1 mutant yeast growing on various media, with and without glucose, were compared. A total of 53 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified as GCR1 dependent based on the criterion that their expression was reduced twofold or greater in mutant versus wild-type cultures grown in permissive medium consisting of YP supplemented with glycerol and lactate. The GCR1-dependent genes, so defined, fell into three classes: (i) glycolytic enzyme genes, (ii) ORFs carried by Ty elements, and (iii) genes not previously known to be GCR1 dependent. In wild-type cultures, GCR1-dependent genes accounted for 27% of the total hybridization signal, whereas in mutant cultures, they accounted for 6% of the total. Glucose addition to the growth medium resulted in a reprogramming of gene expression in both wild-type and mutant yeasts. In both strains, glycolytic enzyme gene expression was induced by the addition of glucose, although the expression of these genes was still impaired in the mutant compared to the wild type. By contrast, glucose resulted in a strong induction of Ty-borne genes in the mutant background but did not greatly affect their already high expression in the wild-type background. Both strains responded to glucose by repressing the expression of genes involved in respiration and the metabolism of alternative carbon sources. Thus, the severe growth inhibition observed in gcr1 mutants in the presence of glucose is the result of normal signal transduction pathways and glucose repression mechanisms operating without sufficient glycolytic enzyme gene expression to support growth via glycolysis alone.\n```\n\n>**Column descriptions:**\n\n>* PMID: PubMed ID of the article.\n>* Evidence: non-TFB/non-TFR article, if it does not describe TFB or TFR evidence.\n>* Abstract: Abstract of the paper.\n"
