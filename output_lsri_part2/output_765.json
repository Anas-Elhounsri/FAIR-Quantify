It utilizes \nthe geometry of a pre-segmented membrane to reduce the complexity of the detection task. As a result, MemBrain only requires a small amount of \nannotated data (even one single annotated membrane can be enough!) and can generalize well to unseen tomograms and membranes. \nIn this repository, we provide all code that is necessary to either\n- train a MemBrain model from scratch, or\n- predict particle locations on segmented membranes using a pre-trained model (see folder `./models`), or\n- just try MemBrain out with our example dataset. \nYou can learn more about the workflow of our method [here](https://github.com/CellArchLab/MemBrain/blob/master/workflow.md). \nFor user instructions, jump [here](#instructions).
