        "value": "**Background**: Knowledges graphs (KGs) serve as a convenient framework for structuring knowledge. A number of computational methods have been developed to generate KGs from biomedical literature and use them for downstream tasks such as link prediction and questioning and answering. However, there is a lack of computational tools or web frameworks to support the exploration and visualization of the KG themselves, which would facilitate interactive knowledge discovery and formulation of novel biological hypotheses.  \n**Method**: We developed a web framework for Knowledge Graph Exploration and Visualization (KGEV), to construct and visualize KGs in five stages: triple extraction, triple filtration, metadata preparation, knowledge integration, and graph database presentation. The application has convenient user interface tools such as node and edge search and filtering, data source filtering, neighborhood retrieval, shortest path calculation, by querying a backend graph database. Unlike other KGs, our framework allows fast retrieval of relevant texts supporting the relationships in the KG, thus allowing human reviewers to judge the reliability of the knowledge extracted.  \n**Results**: We demonstrated a case study of using the KGEV framework to perform research on COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an explosion of relevant literature, making it challenging to make full use of the vast and heterogenous sources of information. We generated a COVID-19 KG with heterogenous information, including literature information from the CORD-19 dataset, as well as other existing knowledge from eight data sources. We showed the utility of KGEV in three intuitive case studies to explore and query knowledge on COVID-19. A demo of this web application can be accessed at http://covid19nlp.wglab.org. Finally, we also demonstrated a turn-key adaption of the KGEV framework to study clinical phenotypic presentation of human diseases, illustrating the versatility of the framework.  \n**Conclusion**: In an era of literature explosion, the KGEV framework can be applied to many emerging diseases to support structured navigation of the vast amount of newly published biomedical literature and other existing biological knowledge in various databases. It can be also used as a general-purpose tool to explore and query gene-phenotype-disease-drug relationships interactively.\n \n"

Run the following bash commands to create the relevant folders for running Neo4j.    \n```\nmkdir neo4j  \nmkdir neo4j/data \nmkdir neo4j/logs\nmkdir neo4j/import\nmkdir neo4j/plugins\n``` \n\nMove the .csv files outputted by the KGEV pipeline in the `NEO4J_OUTPUT_DIR` into neo4j/import.  \n\nThen run the following lines in the terminal (replacing [NEO4J_USERNAME and [NEO4J_PASSWORD] with their true values). This creates a Docker container called `kgev-neo4j` that runs Neo4j.   \n\n```\ndocker run \\\n    --name kgev-neo4j \\\n    -p7474:7474 -p7687:7687 \\\n    -d \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/import:/var/lib/neo4j/import \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/plugins:/plugins \\\n    --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \\\n    --env NEO4J_AUTH=[NEO4J_USERNAME]/[NEO4J_PASSWORD] \\\n    -e NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true \\\n    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true \\\n    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true \\\n    -e NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS='[\"apoc\"]' \\\n    -it \\\n    neo4j:latest \\\n    -c /bin/bash\n```\n\nOnce this container is running, enter the container by running the command `docker exec -it kgev-neo4j bash`. This opens a terminal within the container. Now, run the following commands.  \n```\ncd import \n../bin/neo4j-admin import \\\n     --nodes=nodes.csv \\\n     --nodes=metadata.csv \\\n     --nodes=text_nodes.csv \\\n     --relationships=edges.csv \\\n     --relationships=text_edges.csv \\\n     --multiline-fields=true\n```\n\nThis should import the files we copied into the `import` folder earlier into the Neo4j database.\n\nNow, stop the container using `docker stop kgev-neo4j` and delete it using `docker rm kgev-neo4j`. Now, we want to recreate the container so that it runs the database. Run the following lines (replacing [NEO4J_USERNAME and [NEO4J_PASSWORD] with their true values).  \n\n```\ndocker run \\\n    --name kgev-neo4j \\\n    -p7474:7474 -p7687:7687 \\\n    -d \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/import:/var/lib/neo4j/import \\\n    -v $HOME/neo4j/plugins:/plugins \\\n    --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \\\n    --env NEO4J_AUTH=[NEO4J_USERNAME]/[NEO4J_PASSWORD] \\\n    -e NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true \\\n    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true \\\n    -e NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true \\\n    -e NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS='[\"apoc\"]' \\\n    neo4j:latest\n```\n\nNow, we want to complete our setup of the database. Enter the container again using  \n`docker exec -it kgev-neo4j bash`  \nand enter the Cypher shell (Cypher is a query language for Neo4j) by running  \n`cypher-shell -u [NEO4J_USERNAME] -p [NEO4J_PASSWORD]`  \n(replacing [NEO4J_USERNAME and [NEO4J_PASSWORD] with their true values).  \n\nWithin the Cypher shell, run    \n```\nMATCH (n:Item)\nCALL apoc.neighbors.athop.count(n, '>', 1)\nYIELD value AS v1\nCALL apoc.neighbors.athop.count(n, '<', 1)\nYIELD value AS v2\nSET n.degree = v1 + v2;\n```\nto add the degree information for each node.  \n\nThen, also within the Cypher shell, run  \n```\nCALL db.index.fulltext.createNodeIndex('items', [\"Item\"], ['id', 'identifier']);  \n```\nto optimize searching by creating a full-text index over the nodes. Now you can exit using `:exit` and then exit the container (ctrl+c).  \n\nThe Neo4J database should be completely up and running now.  \n\n"
