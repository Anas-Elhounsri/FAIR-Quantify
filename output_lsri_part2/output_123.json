Despite that essential data sources for basic and disease biology are available, adequate integration remains difficult. Batch-effect correction for both experimental and technological variations is one of the main challenges in transcriptomics studies. To handle this, various batch-correction methods(BCMs) have been developed in recent times. However, the lack of a user-friendly workflow to select the most appropriate BCM for the given set of experiments needs to be resolved for applying batch correction at a large scale e.g. for multi-cohort transcriptomic analysis. In this project, we developed an R tool named \u201cSelectBCM Tool\u201d  to increase the reusability and reproducibility of these BCMs, in order to facilitate the  application, comparison and selection of BCMs. Our tools aims to aid choosing the most suitable batch correction method for a set of bulk transcriptomic experiments. \n\n"

The function is written based on the 'pvcaBatchAssess' function of the PVCA R package and slightly changed to make it more efficient and flexible for both microarray and bulk RNAseq gene-expression data.

Taken from `kBET` [package]( https://github.com/theislab/kBET).\n  * **pcRegression**- Determines `batch effect` by a linear model fit of principal components and a batch (categorical) variable with a default setting (n_top=20). Taken from `kBET` [package]( https://github.com/theislab/kBET).\n * **entropy**- Determines the batch effect by computing the entropy of mixing. It is a parameter to quantify the extent of the intermingling of cells from different batches.

This calculation also accounts for perseverance of biological heterogeneity by measuring ratio of conservation of HVG genes after batch correction.

To use SelectBCM with conda, run the following commands from a bash shell:\n\n```\nconda env create -n selectBCM -c r r-base=4.2.2\nconda activate selectBCM\nconda install -c conda-forge r-remotes\nR\n```\n\nIn the R session, run the following installation commands:\n\n```R\nremotes::install_github(\"tengfei-emory/scBatch\", ref=\"master\")\nremotes::install_github(\"ebi-gene-expression-group/selectBCM\", ref=\"master\", build=FALSE)\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, we also created Docker images to run SelectBCM R package inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container on either linux/amd64 or linux/arm64 platforms. We also provide the Docker file of the SelectBCM Docker images for custom container building from scratch.\n\nlinux/amd64: \n\nPull container from Docker and open an interactive R session:\n```\ndocker pull yysong123/selectbcm:amd64\ndocker run -it yysong123/selectbcm:amd64\n```\n\nlinux/arm64:\n```\ndocker pull yysong123/selectbcm:arm64\ndocker run -it yysong123/selectbcm:arm64\n```\n \nFor a [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) approach of version control, we provide `renv.lock` for the package dependencies. Install the specific package versions as recorded in `renv.lock` using `renv::restore()` at the local package directory. \n\nSelectBCM can be installed via github-\n\n```R\n\ninstall_github('https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/selectBCM')\n```\n\nOr download the package as `zip` archive and install-\n\n```R\ninstall.packages('selectBCM-master.zip', repos = NULL, type = 'source')\n```\n"

It is also recommended to remove low-expressed genes from data if possible. For bulk-RNaseq data, it should be a count matrix.\n\n\n**Output from step 1:**\nThis downloads the experiments in a new directory called **\"experiments\"** in user's working directory and loads all the experiments in R within a list, using `load_experiments` function.\nAfter having loaded the experiments, user will get a list of either `SummarizedExperiment` or list of `ExpressionSet` objects.\n\n**Caution**: Avoid mixing experiments of `SummarizedExperiment` with `ExpressionSet`. Experiments can only belong from any one of the classes only. All the selected experiments should have same gene id format.\n\n"
