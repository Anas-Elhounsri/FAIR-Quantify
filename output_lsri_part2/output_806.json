Here, we suggest an alternative approach to the analysis of microbial time-series. We attempt to track the transition of communities, rather than individual taxa. Cronos detects the intrinsic microbial profile clusters on all time points, describes them in terms of composition, and records the transitions between them. Cluster assignments, combined with the provided metadata, are used to model the transitions and predict samples\u2019 fate under various effects. \n"
