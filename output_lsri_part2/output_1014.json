It was principally developed to handle structural calculations for `REINVENT` jobs, however, workflows can also be run independently.\n\nWorkflows are constructed from elementary 'steps', individual blocks which are combined to specify a sequential list of operations, with control of the command-line options provided through step settings, and options to control other aspects of the step's behaviour included in the `additional` block.\n\nFor many use cases, one of the template workflows might suit your needs, or need a few tweaks to do what you want. Demonstration notebooks for common workflows are available [here](https://github.com/MolecularAI/IcolosCommunity).\n"

Workflows are specified in `JSON` format (see folder `examples`). Currently wrapped are a diverse set of tools and internal steps, including docking, QM and MD capabilities.
