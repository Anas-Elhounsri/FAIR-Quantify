It is a vector of gene official symbols according to the HGNC.\n* *cohorts* The list of TCGA cohorts to be analyzed. By default, CiberAMP will be run on all TCGA cohorts. You can consult the official TCGA cohort IDs here: https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations or in CiberAMP's manuscript (Table S1)\n* *writePath* The path to the folder to save results TIP: if you want to re-run CiberAMP, if you use the same folder where all data was stored, you will not need re-download all data from the TCGA again. This can save you a lot of space in your disk, but be careful, results will be overwritten as well.\n* *pat.percentage* The minimum % of copy number altered samples per gene that will be analyzed.\n* *pp.cor.cut* Threshold to filter samples by array-array intensity correlation (AICC) analysis (0.6 by default). Passed to `TCGAanalyze_Preprocessing`.\n* *norm.method* Method of normalization, such as `gcContent` or `geneLength` (default). See TCGAbiolinks R package for help.\n* *filt.method* Method of filtering, such as `quantile` (default), `varFilter`, `filter1`, `filter2`. See TCGAbiolinks R package for help.\n* *filt.qnt.cut* Threshold selected as quantile for filtering. Defaults to 0.25 (first quantile).\n* *filt.var.func* Filtering function. Defaults to `IQR`. See `genefilter` documentation for available methods.\n* *filt.var.cutoff* Threshold for `filt.var.funct`. See TCGAbiolinks R package for help.\n* *filt.eta* Parameter for `filter1`. Defaults to 0.05. See TCGAbiolinks R package for help.\n* *filt.FDR.DEA* Threshold to filter differentially expressed genes according their corrected p-value.\n* *filt.FC* Minimum log2(FC) value to considered a gene as differentially expressed. Defaults to 0.58 (that corresponds to a differential expression of at least 50%).\n* *cna.thr* Threshold level for copy-number variation analysis. Can be `Deep`, `Shallow` or `Both`\n* *exp.mat* Custom normalized RNAseq counts expression matrix of only tumors. Defaults to `NULL`.\n* *cna.mat* Custom copy-number analysis matrix of only tumors. Defaults to `NULL`.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
