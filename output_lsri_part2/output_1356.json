If you make use of the training/inference code or the pre-trained model weights in this repository, please cite our work appropriately ([How-to-cite](#citation)).  It includes MONAI code for IEVnet training and inference on cropped volumes around inner ears (for details regarding input data format, please refer to the publication). Please note that unfortunately, the dataset for training can not be shared in full due to lack of patient consent. However, we provide two sample volumes for inference in the subfolder `./sample_data`. We also provide the pre-trained IEVNet model weights which was used to create the validation in our publication. There are two ways to run inference with IEVnet - either in a [docker container (recommended)](#running-ievnet-in-a-docker-image-recommended) or in a [local installation](#running-ievnet-locally) of MONAI. The instructions below instructions assume Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) as your operating system. If you are running a Windows system, it is recommended to install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).\n \n"

We are going to use Project MONAI's official image for this, specifically version `projectmonai/monai:0.3.0rc4`. Make sure that docker is installed on your system ([Ubuntu installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), for other Linux distributions, please follow according instructions).\n\nAssuming that you have navigated to the folder of the git repository (e.g. `/my/code/IEVNet` in the above example), you can start the docker container by running:\n```\nmyuser@workstation:/my/code/IEVNet# . start_docker.sh\n```\nThis will map the git repository to the folder `/ievnet/` within the docker container, and expose port 9995 to be able to start jupyter notebooks. Please navigate to the folder `/ievnet` within the docker container. You can query the usage syntax for the inference script \n```\nroot@9b1a4a590da9:/ievnet# python ievnet_infer.py -h\n```\nThis yields the following usage manual:\n```\nusage: ievnet_infer.py [-h] --filenames_in FILENAMES_IN [FILENAMES_IN ...]\n                       --filenames_out FILENAMES_OUT [FILENAMES_OUT ...]\n                       [--device {cpu,cuda}]\n\nProgram for IEVnet inference.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --filenames_in FILENAMES_IN [FILENAMES_IN ...]\n                        Filepath(s) to inner ear volumes (crops). Assumes\n                        input and writes output volumes of dimensions\n                        [200,150,100] at 0.2mm resolution. Several filepaths\n                        are separated with a single space.\n  --filenames_out FILENAMES_OUT [FILENAMES_OUT ...]\n                        Output filepath(s) to inner ear segmentations. Will be\n                        written as .nii.gz volumes of dimensions [200,150,100]\n                        at 0.2mm resolution. Several filepaths are separated\n                        with a single space.\n  --device {cpu,cuda}   Device for inference. Can be \"cpu\" or \"cuda\" (i.e.\n                        GPU).\n```\nFor the provided sample data, you can run the convenience script:\n```\nroot@9b1a4a590da9:/ievnet/IEVNet# . sample_run.sh\n```\n\nIt calls `ievnet_infer.py` on the two provided sample volumes as follows:\n```\npython ./ievnet_infer.py \\\n    --filenames_in  ./sample_data/vol_ie_L.nii.gz ./sample_data/vol_ie_R.nii.gz \\\n    --filenames_out ./sample_data/seg_ie_L.nii.gz ./sample_data/seg_ie_R.nii.gz\n```\nAfterwards, you can load the sample volumes and IEVnet inference results (segmentations) into the Nifti viewer of your choice. We recommend to download and install [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org/). Please note that for volume and segmentation maps to overlap in Slicer, the segmentations need to be transformed from IJK to RAS coordinate system. The repository contains a transform file `IJKtoRAS.h5` which can be used in Slicer to make the segmentation overlap correctly with the volume. If everything went correctly, your visualization should look similar to this:\n\n![3D Slicer visualization of IEVnet inference result.](media/sample_inference_result.png)\n"

Please make sure that your local environment resembles as closely to the following package versions as possible (ideally, also install jupyter lab/notebook). In particular, please install MONAI in version 0.3.0rc4.
