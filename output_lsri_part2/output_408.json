PyRaDiSe is DL framework-independent but can easily integrate most DL frameworks, \nsuch as PyTorch or TensorFlow. The package addresses the following challenges for building radiotherapy-oriented \nauto-segmentation solutions: handling DICOM data, managing and converting DICOM-RTSS data (incl. a 2D-based and \na 3D-based conversion algorithm), invertible pre-processing, and post-processing. In addition to building \nauto-segmentation solutions, PyRaDiSe allows for converting and curating DICOM image series and DICOM-RTSS data to \nsimplify segmentation training dataset construction. Therefore, PyRaDiSe is highly flexible, allows for fast \nprototyping, and facilitates a fast transition of data science research results into clinical radiotherapy research. \n"

        "value": "The main features of PyRaDiSe are data handling, conversion from and to DICOM-RTSS, and data processing, including deep \nlearning model inference. The intended use of PyRaDiSe in the radiotherapy environment is depicted below. The \nDICOM and other discrete medical image file formats, such as NIfTI, are imported into the provided data model using \nthe [`fileio` package](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.fileio.html). In contrast to the \nstandard way of loading DICOM data, this package provides comprehensive and flexible import routines that consider \ndata relation details and automate import steps, such as registering DICOM images if DICOM registration files are \navailable. However, in some cases, the DICOM standard does not provide sufficient information for automation, \nrequiring minimal human interaction for resolution. In addition, discrete medical images also suffer from the lack of \nidentification data needed for automation. However, the [`fileio` package](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.fileio.html) \npackage offers the necessary methods to address these issues with flexible approaches and prototypes. Furthermore, \nthe [`fileio` package](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.fileio.html) provides \nroutines to select specific entities from the available data before loading by generating filterable pre-loading \ninformation (so-called [`SeriesInfo`](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.fileio.series_info.html#pyradise.fileio.series_info.SeriesInfo))\nso that the computation time and memory usage for loading is minimal. Finally, after the data is loaded, it is \nrepresented using the data model implemented in the [`data` package](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.data.html). \nAll downstream tasks are performed using the simple and extensible radiotherapy-oriented data model from this step on. \nAfter loading, the data is either converted and written to a file or processed using routines from the \n[`process` package](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.process.html). This package includes \nfunctionality and prototypes for pre-processing, deep learning model inference, and post-processing with a similar mode \nof operations as well-known medical image libraries, such as SimpleITK or ITK. However, in contrast to other libraries, \nthe process package offers a mechanism for guaranteeing reproducibility and limited invertibility. \nAfter processing or loading, the altered data can be written to disk using a versatile writer from the \n[`fileio` package](https://pyradise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/pyradise.fileio.html) to save the data as either \na discrete image file or as DICOM-RTSS. In addition, specific writers provide the additional functionality to copy \nthe input data from the source to the target directory. This feature is handy if the developed auto-segmentation \nsolution will be deployed to the clinical environment or the cloud, where the original input data should remain \nunmodified. \n"

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
