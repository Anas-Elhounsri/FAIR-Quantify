Data generated by\nmany next gen sequencing experiments is compositional (is a subsampling of the total community) which violates\nassumptions of typical cooccurence network analysis techniques. 16S sequencing data is often very compositional in\nnature so methods such as SparCC (https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc) have been developed for studying correlations\nmicrobiome data. SCNIC is designed with compositional data in mind and so provides multiple correlation measures\nincluding SparCC. \nRunning SCNIC is possible via two different methods. SCNIC is packaged with scripts to allow running it on the command\nline but also is avaliable as a Qiime2 plugin (https://www.github.com/lozuponelab/q2-SCNIC). Either method is valid but\nusage of the Qiime2 plugin provides easier access when working within the Qiime2 ecosystem.\n \n"
