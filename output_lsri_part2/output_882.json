It uses Flask and Electron for the front-end. \nThe purpose of Adera2.0 is to pinpoint drugs that have been already validated for human usage that can be used to treat different diseases. For example, there is a disease (A) with no current effective medication. The task of Adera2.0 is to find a known drug that has been already validated to treat disease (B), and repurpose it to treat disease (A).This process is known as drug repurposing. To find these known drugs, Adera can take a question query in one of the following categories: \n- **Generic questions about diseases.** For example: \n    \n    `what are the drugs known to treat cancer`\n- **The user can also search within a type of drug.** For example:  \n    `what are the known types of statins`\n- **It could also be used to answer questions related to a specific pathway.** For example: \n    \n    `what are the known agonists of SLC38A6?` \n\nUsing the query, Adera2.0 will automatically search PubMed for PDFs that could be answering the user query. Following that, Adera2.0 downloads these chosen PDFs and parses them into one JSON database prior to estaming the embedding of each sentence included in the PDFs. Embedding is essentially building a matrix whose components represent each unique sentence. \nHaving done that, Adera2.0 calculates the relevance between each matrix representing each unique sentence of the PDF and the user query matrix. Then, Adera2.0 proceeds to sort the sentences based on their relevance. It extracts the drug names from each relevant sentence. The relevant sentences and the drug names are written in separate files.\n \n"

        "value": "1) Why did fetching pdfs fail?\n\nAdera can only download and parse PDFs that are not behind a paywall. Thus, Adera can fail if too many of the articles it needs to parse are inaccessible. The solution is simple but requires some trial and error. Try phrasing your question differently or ask a different question altogether. \n\n2) Why does my list of drugs contain only a few drugs?\n\nThe main reason is that Adera only searches whichever PDFs are available to it through PubMed.  As Pubmed updates its repository daily, the results of the search results can vary. You can try increasing the article count so that Adera has access to more data, but keep in mind that this will increase the amount of time Adera needs to come up with results. \n"
