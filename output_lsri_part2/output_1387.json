Create a Python virtual environment to install dependencies and activate that environment.\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir -p ~/mycosnp\n    cd ~/mycosnp\n    python3 -m venv gfpy\n    source gfpy/bin/activate\n    ```\n\n2. Install GeneFlow.\n\n    ```bash\n    pip3 install geneflow\n    ```\n\n3. Install the Python DRMAA library if you need to execute the workflow in an HPC environment. Skip this step if you do not need HPC.\n\n    ```bash\n    pip3 install drmaa\n    ```\n\n4. Install and run any of the three MycoSNP workflows by following the instructions for each workflow:\n\n    * MycoSNP BWA Reference: https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-bwa-reference\n    * MycoSNP BWA Pre-Process: https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-bwa-pre-process\n    * MycoSNP GATK Variants: https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-gatk-variants\n\n    ```bash\n    # From within mycosnp directory\n    # source gfpy/bin/activate # If not already\n    gf install-workflow --make-apps --git-branch v0.22 -f -g https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-bwa-reference workflows/mycosnp-bwa-reference/0.22\n    gf install-workflow --make-apps --git-branch v0.22 -f -g https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-bwa-pre-process workflows/mycosnp-bwa-pre-process/0.22\n    gf install-workflow --make-apps --git-branch v0.22 -f -g https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-gatk-variants workflows/mycosnp-gatk-variants/0.22\n\n    ```"

MycoSNP generates several output files that are compatible with downstream analytic tools, such as those for used for phylogenetic tree-building and gene variant annotations. \n\nMycoSNP (version 0.22) includes the following set of three GeneFlow workflows:\n\n1. MycoSNP BWA Reference:\n    * https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-bwa-reference\n    * Prepares a reference FASTA file for BWA alignment and GATK variant calling by masking repeats in the reference and generating the BWA index.\n2. MycoSNP BWA Pre-Process:\n    * https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-bwa-pre-process\n    * Prepares samples (paired-end FASTQ files) for GATK variant calling by aligning the samples to a BWA reference index and ensuring that the BAM files are correctly formatted. This step also provides different quality reports for sample evaluation. \n3. MycoSNP GATK Variants:\n    * https://github.com/CDCgov/mycosnp-gatk-variants\n    * Calls variants and generates a multi-FASTA file. \n    * Calls variants.\n    * Generates individual vcf files for each sample, which can be used for gene variant annotation.\n    * Generates a multi-FASTA file, which can be used to build phylogenetic trees. \n\n\nThis repository contains installation instructions common for all workflows. \n"
