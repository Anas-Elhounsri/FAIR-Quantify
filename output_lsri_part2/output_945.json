The experimental advances in the large scale mapping of regulatory networks are fairly recent, but modeling efforts date back to the end of 1960s thanks to the pioneering work of Stuart Kauffman and Rene Thomas.\n\nIn a Boolean representation we assume that nodes are equivalent, and their interactions form a directed graph in which each node receives inputs from its neighbors (nodes that are connected to it). The state of nodes is described by binary (ON/OFF) variables, and the dynamic behavior of each variable, that is, whether it will be ON or OFF at next moment, is governed by a Boolean function. In general, a Boolean or logical function is written as a statement acting on the inputs using the logical operators *and*, *or* and *not* and its output is ON(OFF) if the statement is true (false).\n\n"

Please note that versions 1.2.0 to 1.2.4 of the BooleanNet package have  a bug that cause the node updates to execute in original (listed) order during the first iteration, before randomizing the order of nodes for subsequent iterations. This bug affects only the asynchronous update mechanism. \n\nThe net effect of the bug is that for certain type of rules the first execution of them may funnel the states into the basin of one of the attractors. Overall the answers will not be incorrect but, depending on the rules and order of nodes they may be incomplete. Please update to the latest version. My apologies. Istvan Albert\n"

To keep old code from interfering with new one the library namespace has been changed to *boolean2*\n\nIn this software package, we implement mutliple advanced methodologies which combine discrete logical rules with more realistic assumptions regarding the relative timescales of the  processes:\n\n  * *synchronous* updates are performed in listed order, but the states change only at the end of the update round\n  * *asynchronous* updates are performed in random order and the states immediately reflect the changes, this makes the model stochastic. \n  * *ranked asynchronous* updates are performed in rank order, within the same rank the updates take place asynchronously\n  * *time synchronous* update are performed in time. Each rule has a time delay associated with them, updates take place at multiples of these delays\n  * *piece wise differential* updates associate a set of continuous variables (concentrations, decay rates and thresholds) to each discrete variable in the system. The dynamics of these continuous variables is determined by a _linear system of piecewise differential equations_, leading to a *hybrid model* in the manner first suggested by Leon Glass and collaborators.\n\nhttp://booleannet.googlecode.com/svn/webdata/example-hybrid-override.png\n"
