This document will amended periodically to keep it up-to-date, and in case of any dispute, the most current version will apply.\n\nAn up-to-date list of members of the nf-core core team can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/about). Our current safety officer is Renuka Kudva.\n\nnf-core is a young and growing community that welcomes contributions from anyone with a shared vision for [Open Science Policies](https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/taxonomy/term/8). Open science policies encompass inclusive behaviours and we strive to build and maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all individuals.\n\nWe have therefore adopted this code of conduct (CoC), which we require all members of our community and attendees in nf-core events to adhere to in all our workspaces at all times. Workspaces include but are not limited to Slack, meetings on Zoom, Jitsi, YouTube live etc.\n\nOur CoC will be strictly enforced and the nf-core team reserve the right to exclude participants who do not comply with our guidelines from our workspaces and future nf-core activities.\n\nWe ask all members of our community to help maintain a supportive and productive workspace and to avoid behaviours that can make individuals feel unsafe or unwelcome. Please help us maintain and uphold this CoC.\n\nQuestions, concerns or ideas on what we can include? Contact safety [at] nf-co [dot] re\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nThe safety officer is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.\n\nThe safety officer in consultation with the nf-core core team have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nMembers of the core team or the safety officer who violate the CoC will be required to recuse themselves pending investigation. They will not have access to any reports of the violations and be subject to the same actions as others in violation of the CoC.\n\n## When are where does this Code of Conduct apply?\n\nParticipation in the nf-core community is contingent on following these guidelines in all our workspaces and events. This includes but is not limited to the following listed alphabetically and therefore in no order of preference:\n\n- Communicating with an official project email address.\n- Communicating with community members within the nf-core Slack channel.\n- Participating in hackathons organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events).\n- Participating in collaborative work on GitHub, Google Suite, community calls, mentorship meetings, email correspondence.\n- Participating in workshops, training, and seminar series organised by nf-core (both online and in-person events). This applies to events hosted on web-based platforms such as Zoom, Jitsi, YouTube live etc.\n- Representing nf-core on social media. This includes both official and personal accounts.\n\n## nf-core cares \ud83d\ude0a\n\nnf-core's CoC and expectations of respectful behaviours for all participants (including organisers and the nf-core team) include but are not limited to the following (listed in alphabetical order):\n\n- Ask for consent before sharing another community member\u2019s personal information (including photographs) on social media.\n- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences. We are all here to learn from one another and a difference in opinion can present a good learning opportunity.\n- Celebrate your accomplishments at events! (Get creative with your use of emojis \ud83c\udf89 \ud83e\udd73 \ud83d\udcaf \ud83d\ude4c !)\n- Demonstrate empathy towards other community members. (We don\u2019t all have the same amount of time to dedicate to nf-core. If tasks are pending, don\u2019t hesitate to gently remind members of your team. If you are leading a task, ask for help if you feel overwhelmed.)\n- Engage with and enquire after others. (This is especially important given the geographically remote nature of the nf-core community, so let\u2019s do this the best we can)\n- Focus on what is best for the team and the community. (When in doubt, ask)\n- Graciously accept constructive criticism, yet be unafraid to question, deliberate, and learn.\n- Introduce yourself to members of the community. (We\u2019ve all been outsiders and we know that talking to strangers can be hard for some, but remember we\u2019re interested in getting to know you and your visions for open science!)\n- Show appreciation and **provide clear feedback**. (This is especially important because we don\u2019t see each other in person and it can be harder to interpret subtleties. Also remember that not everyone understands a certain language to the same extent as you do, so **be clear in your communications to be kind.**)\n- Take breaks when you feel like you need them.\n- Using welcoming and inclusive language. (Participants are encouraged to display their chosen pronouns on Zoom or in communication on Slack.)\n\n## nf-core frowns on \ud83d\ude15\n\nThe following behaviours from any participants within the nf-core community (including the organisers) will be considered unacceptable under this code of conduct. Engaging or advocating for any of the following could result in expulsion from nf-core workspaces.\n\n- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following and sustained disruption of communication among participants of the community. This includes hijacking shared screens through actions such as using the annotate tool in conferencing software such as Zoom.\n- \u201cDoxing\u201d i.e. posting (or threatening to post) another person\u2019s personal identifying information online.\n- Spamming or trolling of individuals on social media.\n- Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes and unwelcome sexual attention.\n- Verbal and text comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or work experience.\n\n### Online Trolling\n\nThe majority of nf-core interactions and events are held online. Unfortunately, holding events online comes with the added issue of online trolling. This is unacceptable, reports of such behaviour will be taken very seriously, and perpetrators will be excluded from activities immediately.\n\nAll community members are required to ask members of the group they are working within for explicit consent prior to taking screenshots of individuals during video calls.\n\n## Procedures for Reporting CoC violations\n\nIf someone makes you feel uncomfortable through their behaviours or actions, report it as soon as possible.\n\nYou can reach out to members of the [nf-core core team](https://nf-co.re/about) and they will forward your concerns to the safety officer(s).\n\nIssues directly concerning members of the core team will be dealt with by other members of the core team and the safety manager, and possible conflicts of interest will be taken into account. nf-core is also in discussions about having an ombudsperson, and details will be shared in due course.\n\nAll reports will be handled with utmost discretion and confidentially.\n\n## Attribution and Acknowledgements\n\n- The [Contributor Covenant, version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4)\n- The [OpenCon 2017 Code of Conduct](http://www.opencon2017.org/code_of_conduct) (CC BY 4.0 OpenCon organisers, SPARC and Right to Research Coalition)\n- The [eLife innovation sprint 2020 Code of Conduct](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/code-of-conduct/)\n- The [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines v3.1](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) (version 3.1, CC BY-SA 3.0 Mozilla)\n\n## Changelog\n\n### v1.0 - March 12th, 2021\n\n- Complete rewrite from original [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) CoC.\n"

The pipeline supports Illumina sequencing \ndata and complete metagenome and metatranscriptome assemblies. The pipeline involves the \nalignment of metatranscriprome assembly to the metagenome assembly with further extracting CDSs,\nwhich are covered by transcripts.\n\nThe pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The Nextflow DSL2 implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies.\n\n[![Nextflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/nextflow-%E2%89%A520.04.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.nextflow.io/)\n\n[![install with bioconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-bioconda-brightgreen.svg)](https://bioconda.github.io/)\n"
