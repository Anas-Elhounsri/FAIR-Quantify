The Knowledge4COVID-19 framework is devised as a network of data ecosystems (DEs). It aligns [data](https://tib.eu/cloud/s/K3xRdKYMwkQLJYd) and metadata to describe the network and its components. Heterogeneity issues across the different data sets are overcome by various methods of data curation and integration. Each DE comprises data sets, programs for accessing, managing, and analysing their data. Interoperability issues across a DE data sets are solved in a [unified view](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Knowledge4COVID-19/blob/main/KGC-DIS/K4Covid-19UnifiedSchema.ttl). [Mappings](https://github.com/SDM-TIB/Knowledge4COVID-19/tree/main/KGC-DIS/CSV2RDF-RMLMappingRules) between the data sets and the unified schema describe the meaning of the data sets. \n"

In total, 17 concepts are mapped to at least one concept in these ontologies. A [VoCol instance](http://ontology.tib.eu/K4COVID-19/) is also available for Knowledge4COVID-19 unified schema.

In the Open Data DE, DrugBank presents an adequate source for retrieving expected interactions, explicitly providing the interactions of each drug with other drugs in a structured way. However, to enrich this initial set of drug-drug interactions, we move forward to a predictive analysis on our graph that provides an extended set of such interactions. For this purpose, we have implemented a machine learning [method](https://github.com/kbogas/DDI_BLKG) that exploits patterns unveiled from contextual information of the Scientific Publications DE to predict potential drug-drug interactions not existing in DrugBank. Our method is based on the analysis of an Open Data KG, resulting from the natural language processing and semantic indexing of biomedical publications and open resources. The Open Data KG constitutes an integral part of the Knowledge4COVID-19 KG, representing the structured information extracted from relevant publications in the form of triples. All drugs included in Drugbank are also part of this graph, relating these with specific targets, diseases, and other biomedical entities identified in literature text, through a set of semantic relations from the [UMLS Semantic Network](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/META3_current_relations.html).\n \n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
