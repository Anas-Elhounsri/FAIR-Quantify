Food Carbon Footprint Index 2018 | nu3 Conducted a research on directly comparing different diets in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. The research, which reveals the annual CO2 emissions per person for 130 nations worldwide, shows which countries could significantly reduce their carbon footprint by switching to a plant-based diet, as well as which food types generate the highest carbon dioxide emissions."
