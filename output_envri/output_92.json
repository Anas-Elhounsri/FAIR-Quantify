        "value": "While this is meant to be primarily an online tutorial, we find it important to remind people that we should always strive to work in and create a inclusive, positive environment in which to work.\nOur values strongly align with those put forth by the Software Carepentry group, and we adopt a modified version of their code as our own. The original Code of Conduct for Software Carpentry can be found here (https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).\n\nWe are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.\n\nHarassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:\n\nwritten or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above\ncausing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation\nthe display of sexual or violent images\nunwelcome sexual attention\nnonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact\nsustained disruption of talks, events or communications\nincitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm\ncontinuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop\npublication of private communication without consent\nBehaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All Carpentry interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.\n\nThank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.\n\nThis code of conduct is a modified version of that used by Software Carpentry, PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.
