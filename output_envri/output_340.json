        "value": "Bleaching is a key indicator of thermally stressed coral reefs because it almost always occurs under sufficiently high temperatures and because it is readily observed in the field.  Coral reef research has increased so rapidly that a \"Since 2017\" search for \"coral reef\" on Google Scholar gives 12,300 results.  Add the word \"bleaching\" and there are still 2,470 results. \nUnfortunately, while there are many observations of corals bleaching there is little consistency in the data.  How severe was the bleaching?  Who observed it?  Was the data biased by the fact that effort is focused where bleaching has already been observed or where it is convenient to travel?  Do we include citizen observations?  Some efforts to address that include these two papers: \nDonner, S. D., Rickbeil, G. J. M. & Heron, S. F. A new, high-resolution global mass coral bleaching database. PLoS One 12, e0175490 (2017).\nHughes, T. P. et al. Spatial and temporal patterns of mass bleaching of corals in the Anthropocene. Science 359, 80\u201383 (2018). \nComputational results can be just as scattered.  Bleaching can be estimated by rules of thumb based on temperature variations above a baseline, or by mechanistic models.  It is currently impossible to build a really accurate mechanistic model, because fundamental parameters are still being determined.  Each model takes a different set of parameters into account, and must be calibrated with real world data. \nCalibration is the goal of this project.  I plan to use data from Hughes et al. as a reference for calibrating and validating a model I have been working on with Cheryl Logan.  The first step, and perhaps the only step I will be able to complete for this class, is to find a useful way of comparing data between the two sources.  The Hughes data\nare presented for 100 locations of widely varying size, giving simple none/moderate/severe categories for bleaching in each year, and is based on data from 349 references.  Hughes et al. attempt to represent the world's major reef areas, but not to include all reefs.  Our data attempt to cover essentially all reefs with cells about 1 by 0.5 degrees in size.  We know that each area contains coral reefs, but not how much actual reef area is included.  Bleaching is determined by population fluctuations in a simulation of reef growth and mortality.  In other words, the two data sets are different in size, coverage, and data definition.  Reconciling those things enough to make a useful comparison is the challenge. \n"
