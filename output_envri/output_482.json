In this test, the best performing model was SVDpp  - The SVD++ algorithm, an extension of SVD taking into account both explicit and implicit ratings.\n   \n   \n 2. **Iterating and tuning the model**\n  - After the model was chosen we ran several iterations, tuning the hyperparameters each time to see if we could imporve the score.\n  \n \n"

Our previous model would look at other users that have similar interests, and it would recommend other titles that they have liked. This system goes the other direction and it takes movies that you like, and, having learned some information about the film, recommends titles that are similar to it. \nTo do this, we gathered descriptions and genre tags for each film, and then utilized some of Python's natural language processing tools to turn this text information into numerical information. We used the following process: \n 1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**\n   - Short for Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, this is a method for assigning values to each word based on the amount of times it appear in documents. This specific value takes in to account the number of times a word appears in a single description and also how commonly it appears in all descriptions. In a single description, a word is given a high tf-idf score if it appears many times in one description, but it is relatively uncommon across all descriptions. This is partially meant to filter out words that are common to movies in general.\n   \n   \n 2. **Cosine Similarity**\n  - Once each film is represented by a many-dimensional vector, a common method for determining how 'similar' two films are is by caluculating how close to 1 the cosine of the angle between them is.\n  \n  \n 3. **Sorting**\n  - Now that we have a measure of similarity between every pair of movies, we can take in a single movie, sort the rest of the movies by how similar they are to our chosen film, and then return the top 10 most similar films.\n  \n  \nWe have put together a Python class to demonstrate our content-based recommender, the source code for it can be found in the src folder under the name [content_rec.py](../../src/content_rec.py). \n \n"
