After cloning the repository, run the following command inside it:\n```\nnbdev_install_git_hooks\n```\n\n## Did you find a bug?\n\n* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.\n* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n* Be sure to add the complete error messages.\n\n#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?\n\n* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.\n* Ensure that your PR includes a test that fails without your patch, and pass with it.\n* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.\n\n## PR submission guidelines\n\n* Keep each PR focused. While it's more convenient, do not combine several unrelated fixes together. Create as many branches as needing to keep each PR focused.\n* Do not mix style changes/fixes with \"functional\" changes. It's very difficult to review such PRs and it most likely get rejected.\n* Do not add/remove vertical whitespace. Preserve the original style of the file you edit as much as you can.\n* Do not turn an already submitted PR into your development playground. If after you submitted PR, you discovered that more work is needed - close the PR, do the required work and then submit a new PR. Otherwise each of your commits requires attention from maintainers of the project.\n* If, however, you submitted a PR and received a request for changes, you should proceed with commits inside that PR, so that the maintainer can see the incremental fixes and won't need to review the whole PR again. In the exception case where you realize it'll take many many commits to complete the requests, then it's probably best to close the PR, do the work and then submit it again. Use common sense where you'd choose one way over another.\n\n## Do you want to contribute to the documentation?\n\n* Docs are automatically created from the notebooks in the nbs folder.\n\n"

You can download the zip here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4439661 \nIn this data package, you will find two folders: `artifacts` and `outputs` \n`artifacts` contains the videos we collected in our user study, the model files for the different models we evaluated, and the detailed results that we generated (See `Detailed Results` section for more information). The `videos` folder is broken down by user, where each user has a folder contain the apps they were given to create videos for. Each of the apps contain folders that denote the bug they generated a report for. Finally, instead these bug folders there is the actual video-based bug report as an mp4 file. The `user_assignment.csv` just contains the finalized assignments of users to corresponding bug reports. \nIn the `models` folder, you will find the two models we evaluated (SIFT, SimCLR, and OCR+IR). In each folder you will find the corresponding trained codebook files that we generated for SIFT and SimCLR. These codebook files are pickle files that contain the binary representation of the trained codebooks. Additionally, in the SimCLR folder, you will find a checkpoint and pytorch model file that contains all the necessary information for reloading our trained SimCLR model. For the `OCR+IR` folder, you will find all of the code for the OCR+IR model as well as the intermediate output for this particular model, other models' outputs are stored in the `outputs` folder. \nThe `outputs` folder contains all of the intermediate outputs of our code, except for OCR+IR. In the `results` folder, you will find all of the raw rankings and metrics for the SIFT and SimCLR model for all combinations of video-based bug reports per app. **NOTE: SIFT is missing the 10k raw ranking and metrics, but will be provided in a future version.** `evaluation_setting` contains a json file that contains all of the duplicate detection tasks we used for evaluating our models, i.e. `setting 2` (See paper for more details). `user_rankings_weighted_all` and `user_results_weighted_all` contain converted version of the raw rankings and metrics for the SIFT and SimCLR model to match `setting 2`. `extracted_text` contains the output of running the OCR model, i.e. the frames of the videos and the text from each frame. Lastly, `combined` contains the results of the combined tango approach.\n \n"

Lastly, we provide the overall performance in sheet `overall_user_study` and `overall_user_study_comb` of the single and combined model configurations on the settings (used only APOD app) given to the users for evaluating how much time and effort tango can save developers. \nAll sheets show the performance in terms of mRR (`avg_rr`), the standard deviation of recipical rank, median (`med_rr`), and quartile 1 and 3 (`q#_rr`). The same is true for mAP (`avg_ap`). We also show the performance in terms of average rank including standard deviation, and quartiles.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
