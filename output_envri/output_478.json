We then simulated the correlation in metabolic activity using the Generalized Ising Model (GIM) in the anatomical network. This model presented the best fit with the correlations of metabolic activity of the healthy resting human brain in the maximum entropy regime, at the edge of criticality. Subsequently, the anatomical network was modified with the aim of simulating a local brain injury. The impact of these local injuries on global activity was quantified by means of the entropy (in this case, a measure of the computational power of the network) and the difference in metabolic activity correlations between the empirical data of a healthy brain and the simulated injured brain. Among the measures we analyzed, geodesic betweenness centrality and degree emerged as the best predictors of the impact of local injury on simulated whole brain activity. However, the effect of local injury on whole brain activity depends on the topological properties of the injured region.\n \n"

        "value": "**1.** Through the definition of links such as the number of nerve tracts, the tractography algorithm reproduces the structure of communities for the two hemispheres of the brain, and is also capable of predicting, with respect to topological measurements of the structural network, a large part of the most important nodes in functional activity at rest. This thus reflects part of the direct relationship between the structural environment with the count of tracts, and the dynamics of the brain described with linear correlations. \n**2.** It can be concluded that the Ising model applied to the structural matrix is \u200b\u200ba valid approach that reflects the main characteristics that the brain at rest acts as a maximum entropy system. However, given the complexity of the study system, a greater computational capacity and an approach that can integrate a greater number of characteristics of brain connectivity, such as the size of the brain regions, as well as an approach from the point of view of action potentials with the local chemical environment, so that the modeling more accurately reflects brain behavior. \n**3.** Of the measures considered, it was found that geodesic intermediation in the structure is the one that best predicts which injury will have the most impact at the functional level, consistent with what is reported in the literature. However, what was observed with the functional graph for intermediation was that this measure fails to quantify aspects of brain functioning with certainty, because the intermediation measure has a nature immersed in the structural connectivity of the system, where the importance of the nodes based on their position, but for this case, in functional connectivity two regions can be correlated regardless of their distance in the cortex. \n**4.** Of the lesions considered, those in the parietal gyrus were determined to be the most impactful and those in the left cuneus as the least impactful. Injuries can affect the properties of the network in different ways, increasing or decreasing integration or segregation depending on the topological properties of the injured nodes. \n**5.** After injury, the entropy tended to increase, this is related to a decrease in the restrictions on the possible states of the system. However, this behavior should be further evaluated with more diverse and larger lesions. It is necessary to improve the sensitivity of the entropy measure if we want to distinguish more clearly between lesions, using, for example, another parcelling, more iterations or directly another way of calculating entropy.\n \n"
