Only records for Research I & II allocations are used for this report.\n- **midway_usages**: stores all job records in current year-cycle. A record includes all job information dumped from the SLURM ***sacct*** command. Several important columns are (1) date-time (2) account (3) user (4) partition (5) ncpus (6) nnodes (7) charged SUs. Only jobs running on the \"sandyb\" and \"broadwl\" paritions are used for this report.\n- **midway_usages_archived**: the same structure as the **midway_usages** table but stores all records in past year-cycles.\n\nAllocation records are directly dumped from the database covering ***cycles 2013 to 2018***. Usages are pre-processed for each cycle by following steps:\n\n1. Check out all records from either **midway_usages** or **midway_usages_archived** table.\n2. Aggregate records by group accounts and count the total number of jobs, charged SUs, distinct users, and calculate average cpus and nodes for jobs in each group.\n3. For the 2018 cycle, the amounts have been projected to the full year of 365 days.\n\nFinally we aggregated the results of all year-cycles together, so in the table each record (row) is the data for a group in a year.\n\nThe avaliable SUs were estimated from the history of system load. The data can be queried from ***,MCC statistics sever***, stats.###.uchicago.edu and it hosts a time-series database (Graphite) that stores historical logs of allocated and idle nodes reported by SLURM. Data were pre-processed by aggregration to daily average before downloading. After downloading the daily data, we aggregated it by year-cycles. The data points for 2018 were projected to 365 days.\n\n"

Then we combine the group features and usage portion indicators with the correspondingly **next year's usage portion**. The results were presented and explained. \n - From the data above, we  proved that the research groups with smaller size account for a large portion of groups stricken with **Under Usage** which spoilt the **utilization of resources** in M Computing Center. Moreover, given the restriction in resources allocation for large groups, we need consider another way to assess the allocation subscriptions for different groups. The methods we would recommend is to take **group futures** into consideration instead of simply sticking \"equality and fairness\". After all, based on economic principles: \n   To achieve social efficiency, we need to achieve the maximum summation of **Producer Surplus(PS)** and **Comsumer Surplus(CS)**, and minimize **Deadweight Loss(DWL)** that is generated by **quota and under usage**. \n<br />\n<center><img src=\"image/4_1_Deadweight_loss.png\" style=\"width:400\"/></center> \n\nOverall, the indicators we chose are proved to play a significant role in the usage portion and can be considered as reasonable predictor for future usage portion.

However in **2016** it was encountered with sharp cutting down of allocation, and the released protion flowed to **BSD**. However, BSD didn't have correspondingly large usages that there was an early shape of **misallocation**. \n     - In **2017** and **2018**, PSD's allocation proportion wasn't recovered, the declining usage of PSD indicates its caution in consumption and potential failure of utilization.\n   - <span style=\"color:orange\">**IME**</span>: fettered rising star\n     - As a relatively new institute established in 2011, its demand for computing resources climbed quickly.\n     - Since 2013, its usage has generally shrunk with tightly restricted and insufficient allocation, and the same problem occurred to Booth since 2016. \n - ***Rejection sensitivity***:\n     Having experienced rejection to demanded allocation, divisions tended to be conserved in consumption. For scientific researches, this is not always a good trend. In the long term, without sufficient computing-resource enpowerment, researchers will get frustrated and researches will be effected.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n"
