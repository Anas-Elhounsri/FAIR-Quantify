        "value": "# How to Contribute\n\nWe'd love to get patches from you!\n\n## Workflow\n\nWe follow the [GitHub Flow\nWorkflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)\n\nBelow is an Example.\n\n1.  Fork the project\n1.  Check out the `master` branch\n1.  Create a feature branch\n1.  Write code and tests for your change\n1.  From your branch, make a pull request against\n`spotify-research/collabclass/master`\n1.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed\n1.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `spotify-research/collabclass/master`\n1.  Delete your feature branch\n\n## Style\n\nWe follow `black` style.\n\n## Issues\n\nWhen creating an issue please try to adhere to the following format:\n\n    collabclass: One line summary of the issue (less than 72 characters)\n\n    ### Expected behavior\n\n    As concisely as possible, describe the expected behavior.\n\n    ### Actual behavior\n\n    As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior.\n\n    ### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n\n    List all relevant steps to reproduce the observed behavior.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n\nComments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.\n\nFiles should be exempt of trailing spaces.\n\nWe adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit\nmessages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80\ncolumns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).\n\n    collabclass: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)\n\n    Problem\n\n    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem\n    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be\n    thought of being the motivation for your change.\n\n    Solution\n\n    Describe the modifications you've done.\n\n    Result\n\n    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this\n    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.\n\nSome important notes regarding the summary line:\n\n* Describe what was done; not the result\n* Use the active voice\n* Use the present tense\n* Capitalize properly\n* Do not end in a period \u2014 this is a title/subject\n* Prefix the subject with its scope\n\n## Code Review\n\nThe repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository at\nSpotify. For the most part this process should be transparent to the project\nusers, but it does have some implications for how pull requests are merged into\nthe codebase.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the project\ncommunity (both inside and outside of Spotify), and once the changes are\napproved, your commits will be brought into Spotify's internal system for\nadditional testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed\nback to GitHub with the next sync.\n\nThis process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way.\nInstead a member of the project team will post a message in the pull request\nthread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull\nrequest will be closed.\nThe changes in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the\nauthorship metadata will be preserved.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe also welcome improvements to the project documentation or to the existing\ndocs. Please file an\n[issue](https://github.com/spotify-research/collabclass/issues).\n\n# License\n\nBy contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the\nterms of the APLv2:\nhttps://github.com/spotify-research/collabclass/blob/master/LICENSE\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nRead our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the project.\n"
