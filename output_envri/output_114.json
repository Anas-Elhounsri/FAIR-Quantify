        "value": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convergence analysis attempts to examine two basis questions. First, do countries\ninitially lagging in such performance measures as globalization index tend to improve faster so\nthat they catch up to the performance of leading countries over time? Second, does dispersion of\nglobalization index among countries get reduced over time?<br> \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, \u03b2 convergence is used to examine the first question, while \u03c3 convergence is\nused to analyze the second question. The so-called Barro \u03b2 convergence method (Barro, 1991)\nregress the rate of improvement during a period on the initial value of the performance measure\nfor respective countries. If the value of coefficient of slope is negative and statistically significant,\nthen the catch-up process is demonstrated (Barro, 1991; Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1992).<br> \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our methodology, we use \u03b3 convergence (Boyle and McCarthy, 1997) and \u03c3\nconvergence (Friedman, 1992). Common measures of dispersion include standard deviation and\ncoefficient of variation (Heckelman, 2015). For \u03c3 convergence, we have selected to use coefficient\nof variation (CV). CV is measured by dividing standard deviation by the sample average. Using CV\nwhich is dimensionless ratio enables us to compare the degree of dispersion for performance\nmeasures with different units. We then measure the inter-temporal changes by normalizing CV in\nsubsequent years to CV at the initial year of 1991. Therefore, CV in 1991 is always 1.0. If CV in\nsubsequent years is less than CV in the initial year, then, the normalized CV in subsequent years\nwill be less than 1.0. If the values of normalized CVs in the subsequent years continue to decrease,\nand the differences between CVs are statistically significant, the result is viewed as evidence of \u03c3\nconvergence or reduction of dispersion. We use two sample t tests for CV (http://www.realstatistics.com/students-t-distribution/coefficient-of-variation-testing/). This test works best when\nthe sample sizes are at least 10. Since our sample sizes are much larger than 10, this test should\nwork well.<br> \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For \u03b3 convergence model, Boyle and McCarthy (1997) suggested the use of Kendall\u2019s\nindex of rank concordance which measures mobility of the individual countries over time within\nthe cross country distribution of a particular performance measure (Liddle, 2012; Chang et al.,\nforthcoming). In other words, \u03b3 convergence measures the degree of changing ranking order of\ncountries between a given year and the initial year. The \u03b3-convergence we use is Kendall\u2019s binary\nindex version and is defined as follows:<br> \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \u03b3 index has the advantage of being of single number traced over time in twodimension, analogous to the \u03c3 convergence index. The value of rank concordance ranges from\nzero to unity. If no change in rank order takes place, the rank concordance becomes unity. If a\ncatch-up process is present, which result in change of rank order the index will be less than unity.\nThe statistic is distributed as chi-square and we test the null hypothesis that \u03b3 convergence shows\nno difference between ranks of different years (Siegel, 1956).<br> \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Real Statistics Using Excel (http://www.real-statistics.com/reliability/kendallsw/), the proper use of X2\ntest to test statistical difference between Kendall\u2019s coefficients of\nconcordance (W) on yearly \u03b3 indexes requires that the number of countries involved should be\nequal to 5 or more. Or the number of years being compared should be more than 15 years. In\nour case, the number of countries involved will be much larger than 5 countries. Therefore, we\ncan use this X2\ntest to validate the null hypothesis that W=0 or that there is no agreement\nbetween the years being compared.<br> \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we use \u03c3 and \u03b3 index together to evaluate reduction of dispersion as well as\ncatch-up process? There are four different cases that can occur. The simplest case is when both \u03c3\nand \u03b3 index are increasing in values. Under the circumstance, neither reduction of dispersion nor\ncatch-up may be taking place. The second case is that both \u03c3 and \u03b3 indexes are decreasing which\nindicates that both reduction of dispersion and catch-up process are taking place. The third case\noccurs where \u03c3 convergence measure is non-decreasing, while \u03b3 convergence value is in decline.\nSince \u03b2 convergence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for \u03c3 convergence, this indicates\nthat catch-up process is taking place, while reduction of dispersion is not. The fourth case occurs\nwhere \u03b3 index is non-decreasing, while a substantial decline occurred with \u03c3 index. This indicates\nthat country differences in performance measures remain so that no rank change among\ncountries takes place. However, performance differences among countries have reduced\nconsiderably, which indicates conditional \u03b2 convergence. Put it another way, catch-up process may\nbe taking place within subgroups of countries. \n \n"
