A simple way to think of it is that if a cylindrical source is used, the density of lines through the center will be higher than at the edge, creating a fictitious high density at the center. To correct this, we use a flat phantom and place it with it face adjacent to the detectors. Events recorded are then processed. One technique used to improve the statistics is called fan-sum which helps reduce the variance. A sketch is shown below of the process used to variance reduction. ![](https://github.com/jnsofini/Computed-Tomography/blob/master/figures/fansum.png).  \nIn a simples way, the main assumption is that the phantom has a uniform variation in intensity. So, the coouts in detector $i$ in coincidence with a group of detectors B is improved by summing all the counts in B. By summing the count in the group, the statistics is improved without any information leakage.\n \n"
