Note that this command should be run from the terminal in the repo containing the `Pipfile`\n- If jupyter-lab/note are used, just run `jupyter-lab` from the terminal to open python\n- The script can then by run as a usual Python code. \n\nThe steps above may be used with conda as well. Make sure to have installed `pipenv`. \n\n---\n"
