        "value": "We expect global warming to increase the frequency of hurricanes, which would increase Earth's albedo (solar reflectance) because clouds are more reflective than most land/water. This would cause a sort of \"self-regulating\" decrease in global temperatures. However, a recent landmark study (Google \"The Earth is Dimming\") has observed an unprecedented _decrease_ in Earth's albedo over the past 20 years, which seems to contradict our model. Goode et al hypothesized that this is because of a warming of the eastern pacific and consequent reduction in low-lying cloud cover. Our research seeks to hone in on whether albedo measurements/observations over the past two decades reflect short-term anomalies or long term trends. This is signfificant because the latter would indicate a gap in our understanding of how cloud-cover affects global temperatures.\n\n**In short, we're trying to quantify the correlation between cloud cover over the Northern Atlantic and Earth's albedo.**\n"

As of February 2022, they've learned how to access data from the NOAA GOES satellites using FTP protocol, visualize it with NASA's Panoply software, and are currently learning the basics of Python and a few scientific libraries in preparation of recreating Quantify_Cloud_Cover.ipynb \nHere are some of my pre-recorded video tutorials for my students:\n* [Downloading GOES satellite cloud data with NOAA CLASS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBWWs-ZxDWw)\n* [GSS Coding Lessons 1: Introduction to Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rflh9fBcy0M)\n \n"
