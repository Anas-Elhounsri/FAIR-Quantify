Familiarize yourself with the [`Getting your Python setup ready`](#setup) and [`Using Python`](#usingpython) sections below\n2. Check the [`Code along!`](#codealong) section to make sure that you can interactively use the Jupyter Notebooks \n3. Work through the [`0_python_basics.ipynb`](0_python_basics.ipynb) notebook and try to get a basics grasp on the Python syntax\n4. Do the \"Basic Python tasks\" part of the [`exercises.ipynb`](exercises.ipynb) notebook\n5. Work through the [`1_opening_files.ipynb`](#), [`2_handling_data.ipynb`](2_handling_data.ipynb), and [`3_visualizing_data.ipynb`](3_visualizing_data.ipynb) notebooks.  \n   **Note:** the [`2_handling_data.ipynb`](2_handling_data.ipynb) notebook is very comprehensive, feel free to skip the more advanced parts at first.  \n6. Do the \"Data handling tasks (+ some plotting)\" part of the [`exercises.ipynb`](exercises.ipynb) notebook \nIf you are interested in Natural Language Processing with Python: \nUse the notebooks provided in this repository selectively depending on the types of problems that you try to solve with Python. \nEverything in the notebooks is purposely sectioned by the task description. So if you, for example, are looking to merge two Pandas dataframes together, you can use the `Combining dataframes` section of the [`2_handling_data.ipynb`](2_handling_data.ipynb) notebook as a starting point.  \nThere are multiple ways to get your Python environment set up. To keep things simple I will only provide you with what I believe to be the best and easiest way to get started: the Anaconda distribution + a conda environment.  \nBy installing the Anaconda Distribution you essentially obtain everything you need to get started with Python for Research! \nA full list of all the packages used is provided in the `environment.yml` file.  \nPython 3.x is the newer and superior version over Python 2.7 so I strongly recommend to use Python 3.x whenever possible. There is no reason to use Python 2.7, unless you are forced to work with old Python 2.7 code.  \nThe above is, however, not very convenient for research purposes as we desire easy interactivity and good documentation options.  \nFortunately, the awesome **Jupyter Notebooks** provide a great alternative way of using Python for research purposes.  \n> **JupyterLab 1.0: Jupyter\u2019s Next-Generation Notebook Interface**   \nJupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones. \nJupyter Lab is an additional interface layer that extends the functionality of Jupyter Notebooks which are the primary way you interact with Python code.  \nFrom the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) website:\n> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  \nIn other words, the Jupyter Notebook allows you to program Python code straight from your browser! \nAt the heart there is the *Jupyter Server* that handles everything, the *Jupyter Notebook* which is accessed and used through your browser, and the *kernel* that executes the code. We will be focusing on the natively included *Python Kernel* but Jupyter is language agnostic so you can also use it with other languages/software such as 'R'. \nIt is worth noting that in most cases you will be running the `Jupyter Server` on your own computer and will connect to it locally in your browser (i.e. you don't need to be connected to the internet). However, it is also possible to run the Jupyter Server on a different computer, for example a high performance computation server in the cloud, and connect to it over the internet. \nThis should automatically open up the corresponding Jupyter Notebook/Lab in your default browser.\nYou can also manually go to the Jupyter Notebook/Lab by going to `localhost:8888` with your browser. (You might be asked for a password, which can find in the terminal window where there Jupyter server is running.) \nThe Python eco-system consists of many packages and modules that people have programmed and made available for everyone to use.  \nThese packages/modules are one of the things that makes Python so useful.  \n>Sometimes when you try something with `pip` you get a compile error (especially on Windows). You can try to fix this by configuring the right compiler but most of the times it is easier to try to install it directly via Anaconda as these are pre-compiled. For example:\n>\n>`conda install scipy`\n>\n>Full documentation is here: [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) \n* [`0_python_basics.ipynb`](0_python_basics.ipynb): Basics of the Python syntax\n* [`1_opening_files.ipynb`](1_opening_files.ipynb): Examples on how to open TXT, CSV, Excel, Stata, Sas, JSON, and HDF files. \n* [`2_handling_data.ipynb`](2_handling_data.ipynb): A comprehensive overview on how to use the `Pandas` library for data wrangling.\n* [`3_visualizing_data.ipynb`](3_visualizing_data.ipynb): Examples on how to generate visualizations with Python.\n* [`4_web_scraping.ipynb`](4_web_scraping.ipynb): A comprehensive overview on how to use `Requests`, `Requests-html`, and `Selenium` for APIs and web scraping. \nAdditionally, if you are interested in Natural Language Processing I have a notebook for that as well:\n* [`NLP_Notebook`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/TiesdeKok/Python_NLP_Tutorial/blob/master/NLP_Notebook.ipynb): Basics of the Python syntax \nYou can code along in two ways: \nIf you want to experiment with the code in a live environment you can also use `binder`.   \nBinder allows to create a live environment where you can execute code just as-if you were on your own computer based on a GitHub repository, it is very awesome!   \nYou can essentially \"download\" the contents of this repository by cloning the repository.  \nIf you have questions or experience problems please use the `issues` tab of this repository. \n"

Go to [anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) \n 2. Download the **Python 3.x version** installer\n 3. Install Anaconda. \n \t* It is worth to take note of the installation directory in case you ever need to find it again.\n 4. Check if the installation works by launching a command prompt (terminal) and type `python`, it should say Anaconda at the top.\n \t* On Windows I recommend using the `Anaconda Prompt`  \n*Note:* Anaconda also comes with the `Anaconda Explorer`, I haven't personally used it yet but it might be convenient.  \n<h4 id=\"setupenv\">Step 2: Set up the <i>learnpythonforresearch</i> environment</h4> \n1. Make sure you've cloned/downloaded this repository: [Clone repository](#clonerepo)\n2. `cd` (i.e. Change) to the folder where you extracted the ZIP file   \n   for example: `cd \"C:\\Files\\Work\\Project_1\"`  \n   *Note:* if you are changing do folder on another drive you might have to also switch drives by typing, for example, `E:` \n3. Run the following command `conda env create -f environment.yml`  \n4. Activate the environment with: `conda activate LearnPythonforResearch` \nPython 3.x is the newer and superior version over Python 2.7 so I strongly recommend to use Python 3.x whenever possible. There is no reason to use Python 2.7, unless you are forced to work with old Python 2.7 code.  \n<h2 id=\"usingpython\">Using Python</h2> \nThe native way to run Python code is by saving the code to a file with the \".py\" extension and executing it from the console / terminal:\n```python code.py```\n \nAlternatively, you can run some quick code by starting a python or ipython interactive console by typing either `python` or `ipython` in your console / terminal. \n<h3 id=\"jupyter\">Jupyter Notebook/Lab</h3> \n[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) comes pre-installed with the Anaconda distribution so you should have everything already installed and ready to go.  \n***Note on Jupyter Lab*** \nIn other words, the Jupyter Notebook allows you to program Python code straight from your browser! \n***How does the Jupyter Notebook/Lab work in the background?*** \nThe diagram below sums up the basics components of Jupyter: \n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1zFzbyw.png\" title=\"Jupyter Notebook\" width = 400px/> \n***How to start a Jupyter Notebook/Lab?*** \nThe primary method that I would recommend to start a Jupyter Notebook/Lab is to use the command line (terminal) directly: \n1. Open your command prompt / terminal (on Windows I recommend the Anaconda Prompt)\n2. Activate the right environment with `conda activate LearnPythonForResearch`\n2. `cd` (i.e. Change) to the desired starting directory   \n   for example: `cd \"C:\\Files\\Work\\Project_1\"`  \n   *Note:* if you are changing do folder on another drive you might have to also switch drives by typing, for example, `E:` \n3. Start the Jupyter Notebook/Lab server by typing: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` \nThis should automatically open up the corresponding Jupyter Notebook/Lab in your default browser.\nYou can also manually go to the Jupyter Notebook/Lab by going to `localhost:8888` with your browser. (You might be asked for a password, which can find in the terminal window where there Jupyter server is running.) \n***How to close a Jupyter Server erver?*** \nIf you want to close down the Jupyter Server: open up the command prompt window that runs the server and press `CTRL + C` twice.   \nMake sure that you have saved any open Jupyter Notebooks! \n***How to use the Jupyter Notebook?*** \n`command mode` --> enable by pressing `esc`   \n `edit mode` --> enable by pressing `enter`    \n|  `command mode` |`edit mode` \t| `both modes`\n|---\t|---\t|---\n|  `Y` : cell to code\t|  `Tab` : code completion or indent | `Shift-Enter` : run cell, select below\n| `M` : cell to markdown  |   `Shift-Tab` : tooltip | `Ctrl-Enter` : run cell \n| `A` : insert cell above  \t|   \t`Ctrl-A` : select all | \n| `B` : insert cell below  \t|   `Ctrl-Z` : undo | \n| `X`: cut selected cell |    \n\n<h3 id=\"packages\">Installing Packages</h3> \nSome packages are natively included with Python and Anaconda, but anything not included you need to install first before you can import them.  \nI will discuss the three primary methods of installing packages: \n**Method 1:** use `pip` \n> Many packages are available on the \"Python Package Index\" (i.e. \"PyPI\"): [https://pypi.python.org/pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)  \n>\n> You can install packages that are on \"PyPI\" by using the `pip` command:\n>\n> Example, install the `requests` package: run `pip install requests` in your command line / terminal (not in the Jupyter Notebook!).\n>\n> To uninstall you can use `pip uninstall` and to upgrade an existing package you can add the `-U` flag (`pip install -U requests`) \n**Method 2:** use `conda` \n>Sometimes when you try something with `pip` you get a compile error (especially on Windows). You can try to fix this by configuring the right compiler but most of the times it is easier to try to install it directly via Anaconda as these are pre-compiled. For example:\n>\n>`conda install scipy`\n>\n>Full documentation is here: [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) \n**Method 3:** install directly using the `setup.py` file \n>Sometimes a package is not on pypi and conda (you often find these packages on GitHub). Follow these steps to install those:\n>\n>1. Download the folder with all the files (if archived, make sure to unpack the folder)\n>2. Open your command prompt (terminal) and `cd` to the folder you just downloaded\n>3. Type: `python setup.py install` \nThis repository covers the following topics:   \n* [`0_python_basics.ipynb`](0_python_basics.ipynb): Basics of the Python syntax\n* [`1_opening_files.ipynb`](1_opening_files.ipynb): Examples on how to open TXT, CSV, Excel, Stata, Sas, JSON, and HDF files. \n* [`2_handling_data.ipynb`](2_handling_data.ipynb): A comprehensive overview on how to use the `Pandas` library for data wrangling.\n* [`3_visualizing_data.ipynb`](3_visualizing_data.ipynb): Examples on how to generate visualizations with Python.\n* [`4_web_scraping.ipynb`](4_web_scraping.ipynb): A comprehensive overview on how to use `Requests`, `Requests-html`, and `Selenium` for APIs and web scraping. \nI have provided several tasks / exercises that you can try to solve in the [`exercises.ipynb`](exercises.ipynb) notebook. \n**Note:** To avoid the \"oh, that looks easy!\" trap I have not uploaded the exercises notebook with examples answers.   \n*Feel free to email me for the answer keys once you are done!* \n<h3 id=\"binder\"><strong>Option 1:</strong> use Binder</h3> \nIf you want to experiment with the code in a live environment you can also use `binder`.   \nBinder allows to create a live environment where you can execute code just as-if you were on your own computer based on a GitHub repository, it is very awesome!   \nClick on the button below to launch binder: \n <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/TiesdeKok/LearnPythonforResearch/master?urlpath=lab\"><img src=\"https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg\"></a> \n**Note: you could use binder to complete the exercises but it will not save!!** \n<h3 id=\"clonerepo\"><strong>Option 2:</strong> Set up local Python setup</h3> \nYou can do this by clicking \"Clone or download\" button and then \"Download ZIP\": \n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ysak4s3.png\" title=\"Jupyter Notebook\" width = 300px/> \nAfter you download and extracted the zip file into a folder you can follow the steps to set up your environment:  \nhttps://github.com/teles/array-mixer for having an awesome readme that I used  as a template. \n \n"
