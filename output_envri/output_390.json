This library contains functions to georectify and merge multiple oblique camera views, produce statistical image products for a given set of images, create subsampled pixel instruments for use in bathymetric inversion, surface current estimation, run-up calculations, and other quantitative analyses. This library also contains support functions to format camera intrinsic values from various input file formats and convert extrinsic values from geographical to user defined local coordinates. This package intends to be an open- source broadly generalizable front end to future coastal imaging applications, ultimately expanding user accessibility to optical remote sensing of coastal environments. This package was developed and tested on data collected from the Argus Tower, a 43 m tall observation structure in Duck, North Carolina at the US Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility that holds six stationary cameras which collect twice- hourly image products of the dry beach and surf zone. Thus, CoastalImageLib also contains functions designed to interface with the file storage and collection system implemented at the Argus Tower. \r\n\r"

        "value": "\r\nThe module **corefunctions.py** contains a series of functions that implement fundamental photogrammetry calculations to georectify oblique imagery onto a user- defined real world XYZ grid and merge multiple camera views, for both grayscale and color images. Additionally, this module contains functions to generate statistical image products for a given set of images and corresponding camera extrinsic and intrinsic values, as well as functions to generate pixel instruments for use in bathymetric inversion, surface current, or run-up calculations. For rectification tasks, the user first initializes an XYZGrid() object. The user specifies x and y limits and resolution of the real- world grid in x and y directions. The value given for z should be the estimated water level at the time of data collection relative to the local vertical datum used in specifying extrinsic information. \r\n\r\nNext, the user initializes a CameraData() object for each calibrated camera being utilized. Each instance of this class requires all camera intrinsic and extrinsic values unique to that device. For cameras that have not yet been calibrated and the intrinsic values are not known, the user is directed to the CalTech Camera Calibration library , or other relevant calibration libraries such as the calibration functions contained on OpenCV. Intrinsic values are accepted in the CIRN convention or in the direct linear transform coefficient notation. See the CoastalImageLib User Manual for detailed information on calibration and intrinsic value formatting. The user can also optionally specify the coordinate system being utilized, with the further option of providing the local origin for a coordinate transform. \r\n\r\nIf oblique imagery was captured using a non-stationary camera, for example an unmanned aerial vehicle mounted camera, the user is directed to the CIRN Quantitative Coastal Imaging library for calibration and stabilization \\cite{CIRN}. Note that this library requires stationary ground control points (GCPs) and stabilization control points (SCPs). See the CIRN Quantitative Coastal Imaging library User Manual \\cite{CIRN} for detailed information on GCPs and SCPs.\r\n    \r\nThe **corefunctions.py** function mergeRectify() is designed to merge and rectify one or more cameras at one timestamp into a single frame. For multiple subsequent frames, the user can either loop through mergeRectify() and rectify each desired frame on the same XYZ grid, or call the function rectVideos() to merge and rectify frames from one or more cameras provided in video format, sampled at the same time and frame rate. Merging of multiple cameras includes a histogram matching step, where the histogram of the first camera view is used as the reference histogram for balancing subsequent camera views. This step helps remove visible camera seams and improves the congruity of illumination.\r\n\r \n"
