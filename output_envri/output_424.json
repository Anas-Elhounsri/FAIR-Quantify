The success of\na cover crop depends however on good establishment and healthy growth during and \nafter the winter months. If early on the season growers could anticipate how much \ngrowth they expect from the cover crop, late field operations can be scheduled \nmore effectively (e.g. termination of the cover crop, harvesting or planting \nthe next cash crop, etc.). **Statistical learning (~ Machine Learning)**, \nbuilt upon statistical and computational algorithms to \"learn\" from data may help to \naccurately predict cover crop biomass and shoot-N contents across N limited \nenvironments based on early-season field information. \nThis repository features an end-to-end Machine learning project where two supervised\nregression based algorithms were trained, optimized, and validated on a set of remote\nsensing and field observed allometric features of winter-seeded rye grown at different \nN rates in the Mid-Atlantic US. Random Forests capture additional information gains of\ndata-splitting strategies, such as those in decision trees, and add statistical power via\nresampling and bagging. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operators), in turn,\npenalizes long and likely overfitting models, such as multiple regression on highly\ncollinear datasets, and help balancing accurate but otherwise unstable models (i.e. \nlow bias- high variance models). \n"
