However, if care is not taken when analyzing and modeling software data, the predictions and insights that are derived from analytical models may be inaccurate and unreliable. The goal of this hands-on tutorial is to guide participants on how to (1) analyze software data using statistical techniques like correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, effect size analysis, and multiple comparisons, (2) develop accurate, reliable, and reproducible analytical models, (3) interpret the models to uncover relationships and insights, and (4) discuss pitfalls associated with analytical techniques including hands-on examples with real software data. R will be the primary programming language. Code samples will be available in a public GitHub repository. Participants will do exercises via either RStudio or Jupyter Notebook through Binder.\n"
