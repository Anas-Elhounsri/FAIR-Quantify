The former is where the majority of work resides - specifically\n  code that contributes to different investigations; the latter contains writing\n  that has been undertaken towards the dissemination of work, including papers\n  and blog posts.\n* Information on the other subdirectories...\n\n## General workflow\n\nFor the majority of your work, you will likely be doing the following:\n\n1. Make local changes to dust on your branch.\n2. Commit your changes to your branch.\n3. Push changes on your branch.\n\nWhen you have completed a piece of work on your branch, you will likely want to\nmake it available to everyone else so that they can start using it and\ninteracting with it.\nWe do this by issuing a pull request to merge our branch into the master branch.\nWhen doing this, we specify our branch as the source and master as the\ndestination.\nIn order to achieve this, we do the following:\n\n1. Ensure that you have completed the above steps - commit the changes on your\n   branch and push them.\n2. Open the repository on the Github website.\n3. Change to the branch on which you have been working, and click the \"New pull\n   request\" button.\n4. You can now compare two branches - the first should be the branch into which\n   you would like to merge (i.e. the `master` branch), whilst the other should\n   be the branch containing your work which you would like to merge in.\n5. Provide a title and some comments for your pull request - these should be\n   somewhat descriptive so that people can get a general overview of what the\n   pull request encapsulates.\n6. On the right bar, add a review (typically Nick), and an assignee (this is\n   typically yourself, but you may additionally wish to include someone else who\n   has also helped with the code, or who may be working on it as follow-up).\n7. Once you're happy with everything, hit the \"Create pull request\" button!\n\n## General git etitquette\n\n* When creating a new directory or subdirectory, always include a README.md file\n  in the directory to let people know what the directory is for.\n* When working on your branch, it is a good idea to merge changes from the\n  master branch into your branch - this ensures that your branch stays\n  up-to-date with everyone else's changes and work when it becomes available.\n\n## Commit etiquette\n\nWhen getting started with git, it can be easy to forget to stage changes and\ncommit on a regular basis.\nPutting in a little bit of effort, however, can go a long way to ensuring that the\nrepository is well maintained for both yourself and others.\nBelow are a few guidelines to help:\n\n* Please try to ensure that your code works before making a commit; remember that each\n  commit acts as a checkpoint to which you (and your collaborators) can rewind -\n  if someone rewinds to your commit then they will probably expect to find the\n  code in a working state.\n* Try to avoid too many changes piling up before you make a commit. It is better\n  to frequently commit small discrete changes that achieve a clearly defined\n  task (e.g. writing a function or a class). This allows us to clearly identify\n  what each commit is trying to achieve.\n* Please provide short but informative commit messages. Some changes that you\n  make may be incredibly minor, such as fixing some typos, but a well written\n  commit message will enable anyone reading it to understand what you have\n  achieved without having to dig down into the code.\n\n## Branching etiquette\n\n* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch - this is the branch that\n  is on display for viewing by external parties. It is better, instead, to work\n  on your own branch which can then be merged into `master` when necessary.\n* A suggested naming convention for branches is `dev_{initials}` where\n  `{initials}` would be the initials of the person who is working on the branch\n  and `feature_{feature}` where `{feature}` would be a specific contained job\n  that the branch is trying to complete. The former should be used for general\n  work that you are undertaking, and the latter should be used for fixing\n  specific issues.\n"

        "value": "Civil emergencies such as flooding, terrorist attacks, fire, etc., can have devastating impacts on people, infrastructure, and economies. Knowing how to best respond to an emergency can be extremely difficult because building a clear picture of the emerging situation is challenging with the limited data and modelling capabilities that are available. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a field that excels in its ability to simulate human systems and has therefore become a popular tool for simulating disasters and for modelling strategies that are aimed at mitigating developing problems. However, the field suffers from a serious drawback: models are not able to incorporate up-to-date data (e.g. social media, mobile telephone use, public transport records, etc.). Instead they are initialised with historical data and therefore their forecasts diverge rapidly from reality. \nTo address this major shortcoming, this new research project will develop dynamic data assimilation methods for use in ABMs. These techniques have already revolutionised weather forecasts and could offer the same advantages for ABMs of social systems. There are serious methodological barriers that must be overcome, but this research has the potential to produce a step change in the ability of models to create accurate short-term forecasts of social systems. \nThe project will evidence the efficacy of the new methods by developing a cutting-edge simulation of a city \u2013 entitled the Dynamic Urban Simulation Technique (DUST) \u2013 that can be dynamically optimised with streaming \u2018big\u2019 data. The model will ultimately be used in three areas of important policy impact: (1) as a tool for understanding and managing cities; (2) as a planning tool for exploring and preparing for potential emergency situations; and (3) as a real-time management tool, drawing on current data as they emerge to create the most reliable picture of the current situation.\n \n"
