Reading research papers is a skill that has to be learnt. The task is daunting and time consuming for new academics. Academics often spend hours pouring over research papers during the course of their research. We aim to optimize this by providing academics and researchers concise and informative summaries of papers. This can be extended to to simplify all manners of technical documentation, such as medical reports, audit reports, industrial product manuals, etc., based on the information used to train our system. We forecast that a successful summarization algorithm can reduce countless human work hours in large volumes thus opening avenue to new research and developments. Laypeople, hobbyists, people who do not have years of education in a particular field would be able to understand concepts and implement them if they choose to, promoting interdisciplinary progress. \n\n"

We mined research papers under the topic of Computer Science from the ScienceDirect website using the method provided in the research paper \u201cA Supervised Approach to Extractive Summarisation of Scientific Papers\u201d[1]. We spent quite some time processing the data as the output from the mining algorithm was messy. We created two models for both extractive and abstractive methods, and we trained and tested them. The faults in both of our models were substantially different. While our extractive model produced grammatically coherent but irrelevant summaries, our abstractive model fell into an infinite loop, repeating the same words over and over again. Although our models did not perform well, more training time and computational power would definitely improve it. Also, we weren\u2019t able to implement transformers, as that required more computation and time. The future scope of our project would be to implement BERT. \n"

This hurdle has been overcome through this academic research paper: \u201cA Supervised Approach to Extractive Summarisation of Scientific Papers\u201d [1]. They give us a way to mine scientific papers and also create preliminary summaries that can be used as training data. Furthermore, they proposed multiple methods, both analytical and empirical to create text summaries using everything from scoring sentences based on word overlap to advanced methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs. This paper was the basis for the first half of our project, where we explored extractive methods to generate summaries. \nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), while not cutting edge, form the backbone of text generation today. RNNs help deal with the sequential nature of text while also accounting for the dependencies words have on each other [5]. However, they do not account for long term dependencies between words in text. Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) units overcome this by providing an attention mechanism to remember previous words in the passage. This allows for text to be generated from longer, more natural sentences and account for the contextual nature of words. This is the concept used in the second half of our project where we worked on generating summaries using abstractive methods. \nThe state of the art in today\u2019s Natural Language Processing landscape is the use of Transformers namely BERT(Google) [7], GPT-2(OpenAI), et cetera. These improve upon the  by    LSTM concept of attention by using words that occur before and after a certain word. While our system does not compare with the state of the art today, they give a good idea of the differences between extractive and abstractive summarization methods. Implementing transformers is considered to be future work. \n"

Our initial approach was to score each sentence based on the words that overlapped between the main body of the paper and the author generated summaries. The top \u201cn\u201d sentences with the highest scores were picked as summary sentences. To do this, we used a Support Vector Machine Regressor to predict sentence scores based on document vectors generated by Gensim\u2019s doc2vec function. An additional experiment was carried out using pre-trained Glove embeddings but the results were unsatisfactory. Our results were adequate, but did not produce very good summaries. \n \n"

More training data, compute power, and time for training would have certainly made our results better. We have compared both of our approach in terms of their performance and the generated summaries. The future scope of our project would be to train the models we have already created for more iterations and with all of our data.
