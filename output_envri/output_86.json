A pre-print version of the paper can be found here - https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00720 \n_RecoGym_ is a Open-AI gym RL environment for recommendation, which is defined by a model of user traffic patterns on e-commerce and the users response to recommendations on the publisher websites. We hope that _RecoGym_ will be an important step forward for the field of recommendation systems research, that could open up an avenue of collaboration between the recommender systems and reinforcement learning communities and lead to better alignment between offline and online performance metrics. \nFor getting starting with _RecoGym_ please view the 'Getting Started' Jupyter Notebook which will explain the functionality of the environment and detail the creation of a simple agent. The 'Compare Agent' notebook compares the recommendation performance of a selection of our included agents. The agent we include with _RecoGym_ can be found in the agents directory of this repository. \n \n"

We hope that _RecoGym_ will be an important step forward for the field of recommendation systems research, that could open up an avenue of collaboration between the recommender systems and reinforcement learning communities and lead to better alignment between offline and online performance metrics.\n\nFor getting starting with _RecoGym_ please view the 'Getting Started' Jupyter Notebook which will explain the functionality of the environment and detail the creation of a simple agent. The 'Compare Agent' notebook compares the recommendation performance of a selection of our included agents. The agent we include with _RecoGym_ can be found in the agents directory of this repository. \n\n## Dependencies and Requirements\nThe code has been designed to support python 3.6+ only.
