The proposed Deep-learning model shows better prediction performance than the previous deep learning (LSTM, CNN+LSTM, ConvLSTM) based models .</br>\n- If you want to know **more information, please read** [my research paper](https://github.com/papari1123/Research-of-Particulate-Matter-Prediction-Modeling-Based-on-Deep-Learning/blob/master/Paper/%EB%94%A5%EB%9F%AC%EB%8B%9D%20%EA%B8%B0%EB%B0%98%20%EA%B5%AD%EB%82%B4%20%EB%AF%B8%EC%84%B8%EB%A8%BC%EC%A7%80%20%EC%98%88%EC%B8%A1%20%EB%AA%A8%EB%8D%B8%EB%A7%81%20%EC%97%B0%EA%B5%AC.pdf).</br> \n"
