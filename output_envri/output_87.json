On the other hand, valuation is widely considered to be in the realm of \"discretionary\" analysis. This is because, despite valuation tools like DCFs being quantitative in nature, it is often much more of an art than a science when it comes to specifying the inputs. pValuation is my attempt to reconcile the two areas. \nSome of my particular interests include: \n- Financial model explainability\n- Probabilistic programming to ensure that model output includes an uncertainty that reflects the uncertainty of the inputs\n- The general use of data-driven techniques to estimate model inputs \n"
