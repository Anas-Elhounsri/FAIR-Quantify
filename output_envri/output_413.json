These publications explain in details the methodology and benefits of using large-scale proxies for providing skillful predictions of extreme precipitation at medium-/extended-range forecasts (some days and weeks in advance). \nAt a later stage, the intention is to restructure the repository as a standalone toolbox that can be used by users interested in the extended-range forecasts of surface extremes.\n \n"
