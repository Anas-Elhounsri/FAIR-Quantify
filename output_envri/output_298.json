In that sense, this course is a little more directed but also more concise than a repository such as Jake Vanderplas' [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook). Jake's repository, by contrast appears to be much closer to emphasizing completeness. \r\n\r\nYou will also notice various Muppet-themed examples throughout the course. This is because as a television show, Muppets offer an extensive amount of accessible data, from episode guides to wikipedia profiles on characters. This can help give is a flavor for high dimensional data while steer a little clear of some complex theoretical issues that are sure to arise in a more focused and sustained project.\r\n\r \n"

This focuses first on programming skills in python. It includes some key basic programming skills, such as lists and functions, as well as more abstract and complex topics like API access, file types, text processing and dataFrames. \r\n\r\nData science is an emerging discipline concerned with the processing and management of data. Because data is now so prevalent, complex and volumous there is a niche for those with specific skills in data processing. Data science has four pillars: theory, data access, data wrangling and data analysis. \r\n\r\nThis course only goes into very rudimentary detail on theory and analysis. Theory in our degree program is taught through the course \"Foundations of Social Data Science\". Analysis is partially taught with a focus on descriptives. But it is undoubtedly the case that data science is steeped in statistics. In our program statistics skills are taught in two other courses, Statistics for Social Data Science and Intro to Machine Learning. That said, some skills in this course really do benefit from knowing a little theory and a little statistics, so you will encounter some basic theoretical ideas in the pages in this repository. For example, in Week 4, lecture 1 on visualization, several visualization frameworks are included and the visualizations will be based off of some standard statistical distributions, like a normal distribution or an exponential distribution. \n"
