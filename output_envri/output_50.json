Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3735274\n* This dataset is released only for research purposes under a [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n* [Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset for scientific use](http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/)\n* [https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter) \nDue to the relevance of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are releasing our dataset of tweets acquired from the Twitter Stream related to COVID-19 chatter. The first 9 weeks of data (from January 1st, 2020 to March 11th, 2020) contain very low tweet counts as we filtered other data we were collecting for other research purposes, however, one can see the dramatic increase as the awareness for the virus spread. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th to March 30th which yielded over 4 million tweets a day. We have added additional data provided by our new collaborators from January 27th to February 27th, to provide extra longitudinal coverage. \nThe data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are:  `English`, `Spanish`, and `French`. We release all tweets and retweets on the `full_dataset.tsv` file (101,400,452 unique tweets), and a cleaned version with no retweets on the `full_dataset-clean.tsv` file (20,244,746 unique tweets). There are several practical reasons for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms in `frequent_terms.csv`, the top 1000 bigrams in `frequent_bigrams.csv`, and the top 1000 trigrams in `frequent_trigrams.csv`. Some general statistics per day are included for both datasets in the `statistics-full_dataset.tsv` and `statistics-full_dataset-clean.tsv` files.  \n"
