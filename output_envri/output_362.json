We will estimate appropriate values for those parameters using an independent and statistically rigorous approach. \nAs sea levels and storm surges rise due to climate change, this project will highlight important modeling uncertainties and provide recommendations for augmenting the flood protection system in New Orleans.

The values of these parameters can either be stationary (meaning that they don't change at all) or non-stationary (meaning that the value changes as a function of some other variable). \nFor this research, non-stationary values change as a function of global average temperature. \nIn this portion of the research, we analyze 8 .csv files of stationary and non-stationary parameter sets created by one of Tony's former students, Mingxuan Zang. Mingxuan whas uplaoded these files in the \"parameters_data\" folder along with the best fitting parameter sets. Each .csv file has a different combination of stationary and non-stationary parameters and 2064 values for those parameters. \nIt is our task to create a density distribution for each of the 8 .csv files showing 100-year storm levels for all of the 2064 parameter sets. A 100-year storm level is a storm with a sea level height that is only seen once every 100 years, and it is the minimum that cities should be preparing for. \nFurthermore, we wish to show how these density distribtuions change over time as global mean temperature increases. By comapring the year 2016 to the year 2065, we can see hwo the ditribution of 100-year storms changes and whether we can expect to see higher or lower flood levels for these storms. \nThis portion of the project can be found in the 'ReturnLevelCalculations' folder.

This model involves calcualting a change in sea level, pulling stationary GEV parameters, and sampling a surge factor. What isn't clear about this method, however, is where the calulcation for the Surge Factor comes from. It appears to be pulled from a uniform distribution between 1.5 and 2, but this is not clearly stated anywhere. \nThis week, we will begin to model the USACE against our 8 parameter sets to see how they differ. This will be done by sampling changes in sea level from 2016 to 2065, sampling stationary GEV parameters, and samplng a surge factor from a unfiform distributoiion to calcuate 100-year storm level values using the USACE's method. We will then compare the density distribution of values from this method to our own method. \nOur hope is to get the distribtuons to somewhat match up by determing what the distribtuon of surge factors should be. Should it be a uniform ditribution from 1.5 to 2, or maybe from 0 to 10? Is it possible that it's not even a uniform distribtuion at all? \nThis portion of the project can be found in the 'ReturnLevelCalculations' folder.

Thus, I graphed the distributions over time for a return level of 25 years, 50 years, 75 years, and 100 years. Note that we began using a 'uniform' parameter set as well as a 'normal gamma' parameter set for this portion of the project.

Also, it appears that entropy actually INCREASES over time for the model 'Parameters 4', where as entropy stays the same for the model 'Parameters 1' and decreases in all other models. Finally, one notices that the entropy over time lines all appear to have an inflection point somewhere before or around the year 2040, which must be investigated.\n \n"

Code can be found in the folder titled \"RejectionSampling\". The process of rejection sampling looks a little bit as follows: \n- Pick a projection year as well as a projection return period. Sample a random surge factor\n- Use the above to create two models, one for our own model and one for the USACE's\n- Now, for every projected flood level in our model, compare the probability of that flood level occuring to the probability of the same flood level occuring in the USACE model\n- If the ratio of Probability (Our Model) : Probability (USACE) model is within a certain range, accept the surge factor sampled in step one\n- Repeat this process for a bunch of different surge levels \nYou can read more about rejection sampling here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling). The process is a little bit tricky due to the way our model spreads out as projection years and return levels increase. These means that our model's shape is changing, which also changes the viability of rejection sampling. \nThese two weeks have also been dedicated to another very exciting process: Submitting and abstract and applying for travel grants! Tony and I are attempting to take this research to the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting 2019 (https://www2.agu.org/fall-meeting), meaning we had to write a scientific abstract, a normal language abstract, and a scientific merit essay to be considered. Because the Fall Meeting comes with some costs, I also wrote a number of essays in order to apply for a student travle grant from both the AGU and the University of Colorado Boulder. Essay writing and editing is a little bit time consuming, meaning that it slowed our work with rejection sampling. However, given that the deadlines for the abstract submissions and travel grants are fast approaching, it was good for us to complete our submissions now instead of waiting until the last minute.\n \n"

The approximate year that this happens is as follows:\n\n- Parameter Set 3: 2042\n- Parameter Set 5: 2029\n- Parameter Set 6: 2032\n- Parameter Set 7: 2036\n- Parameter Set 8: 2029\n\nIn general, it seems that as the number of non-stationary parameters increases, the time it takes for the distribution to become wide and flat decreases.\n\nBecause of this, we decided to try a different method in which we assign weights to each parameter set based on how good we think its data is, pull a value from the distributions, multiply that value by the weight, and form an entire new distribution of 100 year storm values. This method is called Bayseian Model Averaging.\n\nFor this method, I will begin by assigning the weights myself and then see how the resulting ditribution turns out. If its data looks better - and mu appears to increase over time rather than decrease - we will run an actual algorithm to determine what the exact weights for each parameter set will be. \n\nI plotted the distirbution with three different weight values: \n\n1) 0.8, 0.1, 0.06, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01\n![](BMA_1_Gif.gif)\n2) 0.9, 0.05, 0.04, 0.0025, 0.0025, 0.0025\n![](BMA_2_Gif.gif)\n3) 0.6, 0.3, 0.3, 0.025, 0;025, 0.025, 0.025\n![](BMA_3_Gif.gif)\n\nBecuase the distributions move right over time, their mu values must be increasing, which is what we expected to see. So, Tony will run ana anlysis to find out what the exact weights should be. However, notice how the distributions widen out over time - this means that we're losing information as we try to make estimates further and further in the future. Thus, our estimates are becoming less and less accurate as well!\n"
