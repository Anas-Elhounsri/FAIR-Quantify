For ImageNet, this is a central crop to (224, 224) and scales\nthe pixel values to the range [-1, +1]. The dictionary holding the inputs\n`features` follows the same naming convention as `tensorflow_datasets`. As all\nimported datasets are currently image datasets, this means that a batch of\nimages will be stored in the field `features[\"image\"]`.\n\n\nFor examples, see `models`. You don't need to store the model file there.\n\n__Parameterized models.__ Sometimes you have multiple model variants that you\nwould like to to test, e.g., different model sizes or training datasets. To\nachieve this, add arguments to the `create` function, e.g. `create(network_type,\nnetwork_width)` to import networks of varying widths and sizes.\n\n__Non-TensorFlow models.__ If your model is not written in TensorFlow, you can\nconvert the data to numpy and feed those to your model. For example, take a look\nat `models/random_imagenet_numpy.py`, `models/vit.py` for a JAX model, and\n`models/vgg.py` for a PyTorch model. Please do not forget to set the flag\n`--tf_on_cpu` in `compute_report.py`.\n"
