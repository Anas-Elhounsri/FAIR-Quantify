Whales and dolphins in this dataset can be identified by shapes, features and markings (some natural, some acquired) of dorsal fins, backs, heads and flanks. Some species and some individuals have highly distinct features, others are very much less distinct. Further, individual features may change over time. This competition expands that task significantly: data in this competition contains images of over 15,000 unique individual marine mammals from 30 different species collected from 28 different research organizations. Individuals have been manually identified and given an individual_id by marine researches, and your task is to correctly identify these individuals in images. It's a challenging task that has the potential to drive significant advancements in understanding and protecting marine mammals across the globe."
