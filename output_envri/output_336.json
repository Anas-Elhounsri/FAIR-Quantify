In terms of cloud coverage, Stanford is featured by long summers with mostly clear sky and short winters with partly cloudy sky.\n\nTwo major categories of data are collected and logged: sky images and PV power generation. Data are recorded according to their internal clocks synchronized with the local time zone, which is Pacific Standard Time (PST), to ensure consistency. Over the past five years, our lab has collected over 3 terabytes of data. In this release, we open-source the data from 2017 March to 2019 December[^1]. Here, we provide two levels of data to suit the different needs of researchers: (1) A processed dataset consists of 1-min down-sampled sky images (64x64) and PV power generation pairs, which is intended for fast reproducing our previous work and accelerating the development and benchmarking of deep-learning-based solar forecasting models; (2) A raw dataset consists of high resolution sky images (2048x2048) and PV power generation data, as well as the source sky video footage, which is intended for customizing data extraction, and exploring other related areas of solar forecasting such as cloud segmentation and cloud movement forecasting. \n\nIn a future release, we will open source the data from 2020 and beyond of the Stanford dataset and include two additional data sources: sky images and PV power generation data from a solar farm in Oregon collected by our research group and sky images from cameras set up by NREL which correspond to solar irradiance data collected by them. The update information will be released in this GitHub repository.\n\n[^1]: The dataset suffer from some interruptions due to the water intrusion, wiring and/or electrical failure of the camera as well as daylight-saving adjustment failure in 2017 and 2018, which is back to normal for 2019 and beyond.\n"

Camera aperture, white balance and dynamic range are held constant.

This large-scale dataset is expected to include data streams coming from all over the world and cover a wide range of climate conditions, thus calling on a joint effort from the community. If you would like to collaborate on building such a dataset, please reach out directly to the PI Adam Brandt (abrandt@stanford.edu). \nSome of our ongoing efforts include: (1) continuing the data collection at Stanford Campus; (2) having a new data stream from Oregon (Stanford North) with the same camera set up; and (3) webscraping 1-min high-res sky images from [NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory](https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/apps/sitehome.pl?site=SRRLASI) which are open-sourced but not archived [^4] (Stanford East).  \n[^4]: NREL only archives sky images in 10-min frequency and open sources to the public.\n \n"

Our group has developed a specialized convolutional neural network model named SUNSET (Stanford University Neural Network for Solar Electricity Trend) for PV output forecast. Two specific prediction tasks were investigated based on SUNSET, including (1) PV power generation nowcast [[2]](#2), i.e., given a sky image, predicting the contemporaneous PV output; and (2) PV power generation forecast [[1]](#1), given sky images and PV output for the past 15 minutes on 1-minute resolution, predicting PV output 15 minutes ahead into the future. The details of these two models can be found in the corresponding published papers. It should be noted that the results shown below are based on the results from our previous publications for demonstration purpose, for results based on the benchmark dataset, please refer to our [dataset paper](). As described in the paper, we implemented these two deep learning models using TensorFlow 2.x, which is an update from the TensorFlow 1.x code base used in our previous publications. The new code base can be found in the directory `\\models`. The old code base can be found in our [SUNSET Model](https://github.com/YuchiSun/SUNSET) GitHub repository.\n"
