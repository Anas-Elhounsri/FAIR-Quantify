This is a complex form of entanglement that exhibits highly non-classical behavior. This can be used in quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography protocols.

A good example of this the GPU or *Graphics Processing Unit*, or Google's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) which have enhanced machine learning drastically in recent years. Other examples might be the *neuromorphic computing chips* that Intel has designed. These were all designed to solve specific kinds of problems, such as enhancing machine learning tasks. Quantum computers can be thought of in a very similar way. There is a classical computer interface that delegates certain computational tasks to the quantum hardware. The quantum hardware then processes that computational task and then the classical computer receives the output data. There are many kinds of problems that quantum computers can solve. In fact, any computational task a classical computer can solve, a quantum computer can also solve. However, classical computers are still more efficient at certain things, so they will not be going anywhere. There are many algorithms and problems that can be solved exponentially faster on a quantum computer compared to all known classical methods.  \nFinding out where this computational advantage comes from is one of the central tasks of quantum computing research. There is a [Quantum Algorithm Zoo](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/), which lists many of the known algorithms that give speedup over classical methods. Much of the focus of The Singularity is to research these various applications and algorithms and implement them in various quantum computing languages. Some applications include using Shor's algorithm to break RSA public key cryptography and other algorithms that break elliptic curve cryptography.
