This project is funded by Master's Opportunity for Research in Engineering (MORE). \nThe first challenge that was faced was cleaning the raw data; the data conntained missing values, there were errors in data collection, removing irrelevant data etc.\nThe link to the raw batchwise datasets are:\nBatch 1: https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204/batches/5c86c0b5fa2ede00015ddf67\nBatch 2: https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204/batches/5c86bf14fa2ede00015ddd83\nBatch 3: https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204/batches/5c86bd64fa2ede00015ddbb3 \nAfter cleaning the data, discharge curves were developed with each of their parametric equations. These parametric equations were used to develop new features for the creating a machine learning model to predict the life cycle of the lithium-ion cells. Initially a ordinary least sqaure regression model was used to predict the life cycle and later it was compared to a quantile regression model.\n \n"
