There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see\nyour current agreements on file or to sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n## Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult\n[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\n## Code submission guidelines\n\nHere are the few steps you need to follow to ensure a smooth review of your\npull request:\n\n- Ideally one PR corespond to one feature or improvement to make it easier to\n  review. So **try** to split your contribution in meaning logical units.\n- Your code **must** pass the unit-tests. We use `pytest` so simply run it at the\n  root of the project\n- Your code **must** comes with unit-tests to ensure long term quality\n- Your functions **must** be documented except obvious ones.\n- Your code must pass `flake8` to ensure you follow Python coding standards.\n\n## Community Guidelines\n\nThis project follows\n[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).\n"
