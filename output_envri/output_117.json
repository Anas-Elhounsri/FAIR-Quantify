They include the following: \n1. command line utilities in Unix/Linux \n2. an open-source scientific software ecosystem (our favorite is Python's)\n3. software version control (we advocate the distributed kind: our favorite is git)\n4. good practices for scientific software development: code hygiene and testing\n5. knowledge of licensing options for sharing software \n \n"

This requires the open exchange of data, procedures and materials.\"_\nIn computational research, we and many others maintain that this tenet calls for open-source software, and open data.\n \n"

The\n        Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and\n        formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical\n        modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not\n        to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical\n        modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n        technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological\n        Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making\n        modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted\n        Material. Downstream recipients. Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed\n        Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n        receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights\n        under the terms and conditions of this Public License. No downstream\n        restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different\n        terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures\n        to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed\n        Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement.\n        Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as\n        permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the\n        Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted\n        official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive\n        attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n    Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed\n        under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other\n        similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the\n        Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the\n        Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the\n        Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not\n        licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor\n        waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the\n        Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under\n        any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In\n        all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect\n        such royalties.\n\nSection 3 \u2013 License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\n    Attribution.\n\n        If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You\n            must: retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with\n            the Licensed Material: identification of the creator(s) of the\n            Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution,\n            in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by\n            pseudonym if designated); a copyright notice; a notice that refers\n            to this Public License; a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n            warranties; a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n            extent reasonably practicable; indicate if You modified the Licensed\n            Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n            indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public\n            License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this\n            Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in\n            any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink\n            to a resource that includes the required information. If requested\n            by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by\n            Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You\n            Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply\n            must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying\n            with this Public License.\n\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your\nuse of the Licensed Material:\n\n    for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,\n    reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of\n    the database; if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then\n    the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its\n    individual contents) is Adapted Material; and You must comply with the\n    conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the\n    contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your\nobligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other\nCopyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n    Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\n    possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,\n    and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the\n    Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This\n    includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n    for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other\n    defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not\n    known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in\n    full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. To the extent\n    possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory\n    (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct,\n    special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other\n    losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or\n    use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the\n    possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation\n    of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not\n    apply to You.\n\n    The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above\n    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely\n    approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\n    This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights\n    licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then\n    Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n    Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section\n        6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is\n        cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n        violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the\n        avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the\n        Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public\n        License. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will\n        not terminate this Public License. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive\n        termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or\n    conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. Any arrangements,\n    understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated\n    herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this\n    Public License.\n\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be\n    interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of\n    the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under\n    this Public License. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public\n    License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be\n    reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the\n    enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. No term or condition\n    of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to\n    unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. Nothing in this Public License\n    constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any\n    privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from\n    the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n"
