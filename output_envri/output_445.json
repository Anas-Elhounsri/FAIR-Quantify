Only a few from the given questions answered. In mine questions, half of them had been answered with questions. I had multiple questions with extremely irrelevant answers.\nI noticed that summarized papers needed much less time to transform to\nembeddings with not much difference in answers. Finally, the number of\npapers 6000 or 9000 in summarized papers had a very small differnce in\nresults and still small time of execution (in CUDA).\n  - Future work: I would remove the sentences from the corpus that are questions and probably I would change the pretrained NN that I used.\n- __CrossEncoders__\n  - ___Notebook:___ BASH2*\n  - ___Pre-trained model:___\n    - NN: msmarco-distilbert-base-v2 and\n    - cross-encoder: ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-6\n  - ___Results:___ Non summarized papers had the best results so far as lots of the\n  questions were answered. Summarized papers model, didn\u2019t have good\n  performance and this due to mine summarization and not due the model\n  selection (in my understanding).\n  - ___Future work:___ Process again the summarized papers by increasing the ratio\n  and max_length\n- __InferSent__\n  - ___Notebook:___ BASH3*\n  - Implemented but stucked to encoding. I tried to make it work but I get some\n  errors that I don\u2019t understand. No remarks for this model\n- __Doc2Vec__\n  - ___Notebook:___ BASH4*\n  - ___Results:___ Terrible results for both summarized and not papers. I can\u2019t understand what I am doing wrong\n  - ___Future work:___ Implementation again from the very start.\n \n"

This\ndataset gives a lot of information for every paper and so I had to choose what I should\nand shouldn\u2019t use. I decided to use the corpus of each paper, with the pre-process of:\n- Small sentences, with size < 3 words are dropped.\n- Removed references to other papers.\n- Removed links.\n- Removed list symbols and other unicodes.\nAlso, I tried using Summarizer from bert-extractive-summarizer because papers corpus was extremely big in some papers and training of that model needed hours to\nfinish.\n\n__Data-storage__\nI am using a big dictionary of: __sentence \u2212\u2192 (paper_id,paper_title)__\nIf a sentence belongs to more than one papers, it is not a problem, as question is answered from at least one paper.\nThis dictionary I am storing it and reading it every time I need (.pickle file)\n"
