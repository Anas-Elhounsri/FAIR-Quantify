Inorganic accounts more often share links, however organic accounts more often retweet. In the dataset, organic accounts retweeted 72,458 accounts, and out of these 6,374 accounts were classified as inorganic accounts. The links shared by the inorganic accounts are usually from untrusted sources. \nThe sentiment of tweets for the inorganic accounts is mostly neutral to positive, however organic accounts tend to have more negative to neutral tweets. Topic modeling shows that the inorganic accounts have some overlap and closeness implying the discussion is focused on similar topics. Organic accounts have more variation in their topics of discussion. \nThis work demonstrates that there is evidence of misinformation being spread by the inorganic accounts, and the links that are posted by the inorganic accounts are mostly self-referential sources, which are presented as facts, but lack verification by other trusted sources. \n"
