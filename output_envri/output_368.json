We aim to develop capacity to design, validate, deploy, and govern large-scale economic systems. CryptoEconLab strives to empower projects in the ecosystem through novel incentives and advance humanity\u2019s understanding of multiagent systems and algorithmic steering of economic networks. \nWe are applying our learnings to grow and maintain the Filecoin ecosystem, where we are active drivers and participants. Filecoin is a layer1 blockchain that orchestrates a decentralized data storage network designed to store humanity\u2019s most important information - and Filecoin\u2019s unique cryptoeconomic system is central to its design.\n \n"

If so, we will respond in the comments with the following information:\n- The issue should contain all of the information requested in the form.\n- Questions or clarifications on the submitted request \n- Possible paths forward, which may contain different levels of support depending on staff availability and priority\n- We will then work with the requestor to develop an appropriate work plan and communication plan that is mutually agreeable. At a minimum, this would be commenting on outcomes in the Github issue; but could also expand to include modeling or analysis workstreams and/or discussions, documents, reports, or meetings. \nIn general, we will work to support the following timelines after a request has completed the above steps (submission and scope agreement):\n- 2 weeks for initial review of FIPs or FIP discussions\n- 2 weeks to interpret new questions about existing CryptoEconLab models and analysis\n- 2+ weeks to scope and plan for new CryptoEconLab models and analysis (this does not include the actual modeling and analysis, which cannot be estimated before understanding all the previous steps for a given request) \nIf questions or clarifications about the original request take more time to resolve, all subsequent time frames would extend by this amount.\n \n"
