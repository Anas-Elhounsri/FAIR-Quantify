Researchers track these patients from initial diagnosis through their course of treatment over a minimum of 5 years, capturing patient lab values, treatments, and complications. In addition to these data, there is a rich store of biological and demographic data of each patient at baseline, including RNA-seq, cytogenetics, and survey (e.g. Quality of Life) data. \n\nML-MMRF is a repository built to process the MMRF CoMMpass Dataset and allows researchers to use these data for machine learning. We first parse the raw MMRF files into tensors (stored in numpy matrices), then clean and normalize the tensors, and finally provide a notebook for validation of the procedure. \n\n![](./data_fig.png)\n**Figure 1** - Example of Patient Data Post-Processed w/ ML-MMRF: Illustration of data from a multiple myeloma patient. Baseline (static) data typically consists of genomics, demographics, and initial labs. Longitudinal data typically includes laboratory values (e.g. serum IgG) and treatments. Baseline data is usually complete, but longitudinal measurements are frequently missing at various time points. The data tells a rich story of a patient's disease trajectory and the resulting treatment decisions. For example, a deviation of a lab value from a healthy range (e.g. spike in serum IgG) might prompt a move to the next line of therapy. Missing data (e.g. points in red) in this case are forward filled.\n"

The user specifies the granularity of time at which we parse, i.e. the number of days between subsequent time steps, and also specifies ```maxT```, the max time for which we parse. Finally, we also return a binary mask tensor, where we store a value of 1 if it is observed and 0 if it is missing. As an example, if we specify ```granularity``` to be 60 and ```maxT``` to be 33, which are the default settings, then the treatment and labs tensors will be of size ```N x 33 x D```. Furthermore, suppose ```t = 1,...,maxT```; the time between ```t``` and ```t+1``` is determined by granularity, which in this case is 60 days (2 months). \n\nThere are three data types that we parse from the raw MMRF files: treatments, patient labs, and baseline data (basic demographics and cytogenetics).
