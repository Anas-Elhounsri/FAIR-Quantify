Similar to the Lidar data, the camera data of the training, validation and testing sets cover the first 1 second of each of the 9 second windows. Instead of releasing raw camera images, we release the image tokens and image embedding extracted from a pre-trained VQ-GAN model.\n- The initial release of the WOMD camera data contained misalignment between LiDAR data and roadgraph inputs for some frames. The 1.2.1 release provides new timestamps for the lidar data with an updated pose transformation matrix per time step. \nSim Agents:\n- We have improved the quality of the kinematic metrics by using smoother estimates of speeds and accelerations.\n- We have fixed an edge case for offroad computation with over-passes.\n- We have re-calibratred the metric configuration and composite metrics weights.\n- We report simulated collision and offroad rates (not likelihoods). \n"
