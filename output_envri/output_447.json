Some of these proteins allow multi-drug resistant bacteria or superbugs to inactivate a wide range of penicillin-like antibiotics, which is known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR). According to the World Health Organization, AMR is one of the [top ten global public health threats facing humanity in this century](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance), so it is important to search for potential compounds that combat these superbugs and prevent AMR, which is the aim of this project. You can find detailed information about AMR and Beta-Lactamase in this [blog](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/187).\n \n"

These molecular descriptors are also known as molecular fingerprints, and they are property profiles of molecules, represented as vectors with each vector element representing the existence or the frequency of a structural feature. The extraction of molecular fingerprints from SMILES was performed with [PaDEL](http://www.yapcwsoft.com/dd/padeldescriptor/) software, following instructions from [this video](https://youtu.be/rEmDyZHz5U8).\n\nPaDEL has 12 available fingerprints, but for this project, we calculated 10 of them because KlekotaRothFingerprintCount and KlekotaRothFingerprinter required a long computing time to be obtained.\n\nIn addition, it is important to notice that this dataset contains interaction data of molecules with various Beta-lactamases. Therefore, we can create independent machine learning models for each of these proteins, or a single unified model for all of them, which is known as the proteochemometric model. In this project, I created independent models for **Beta-lactamase AmpC**.\n"
