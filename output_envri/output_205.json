This scheme encourages emerging and eminent scientist in field of science and engineering for individual centric competitive mode of funding. Since the scheme provides core research support to the active researchers, the existing name Extramural Research (EMR) has been renamed as Core Research Grant (CRG). \nExtramural Research (EMR) funding scheme of Indian Science and Engineering Research Board to academic institution, research laboratories and other R&D organizations to carry out basic research in areas of Science and Engineering. \ndata - \nhttp://www.serb.gov.in/emr-projects.php \nThe data is of approved projects from years 2015 till 2020.[http://www.serb.gov.in/emr-projects.php] \n\nProcessing -\nSTEP 1 - Read from PDF  to csv - \nUse Python tabula library to read the pdf files. \nMany observations are spread across multiple rows.\nFor such obeservatoins,the Cost feature is is the grouping criteria.\nCreated a logic around this to properly get all the rows. \n\nSTEP 3 - Clean -  Process 2016-17,2017-18,2018-19,2019-20 together as the data structure is similar.\n1.
