Identify errors in trading operations and visualize the dependencies between them.\nProvide suggestions and advice for future trading.\n\nMain stage of Project:\n* Data preparaition to needed format.\n* Data structure research.\n* Exploring data dependencies.\n* Data cleaning.\n\n\n\n\n**Purpose of preparation data** \u2014 \nData preparation includes a deeper study of features and their comparison with each other.\n\n**Purpose of data structure research** \u2014 \nThe research of the data structure is understood as the division of some features into several more informative ones. The study of the diversity of features obtained from the database. Suggestion for future work.\n\n**Purpose of data data preparation** \u2014 \nData preparation includes a deeper study of features and their comparison with each other.\n\n**Purpose of exploring data dependencies** \u2014 \nThe study of dependencies in data refers to the construction of pivot tables and the visualization of graphs to form an understanding of the need for further transformations. Based on the information obtained at this stage, we can get an understanding of the trends in the studied traits, outliers and traits that require detailed study.\n\n**Purpose of data cleaning** \u2014 \nDrop \"trash\", that can interfere with the simulation or distort his result. In many tasks data cleaning - this is main part of stage of preparation data to build a model. \nFor that need a lot of time to work.\n\n**Adout Structure:**\n* [data](./data) - folder with general and additional data base\n* [plotly](./plotly) - folder with picture of diagrams from main file.\n* [main.ipynb](./main.ipynb) - jupyter-notebook, contained main code of project for first traider.\n* [s_main.ipynb](./s_main.ipynb) - jupyter-notebook, contained main code of project for second traider.\n* [crypto.ipynb](./crypto.ipynb) - jupyter-notebook, contained main code of project for second traider.\n"
