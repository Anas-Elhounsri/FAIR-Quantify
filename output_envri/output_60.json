This allows us to view the interpolation as time progresses. \nThere also exists a lag time from when the boat collects the data to when the data actually reaches the boat. The lag time is estimated to be between 1 and 5 minutes. For each date, the left column represents the interpolated values using the original data, and the right represents the interpolated values using the corrected latitude and longitude. For the corrected values, the lag time is set to 200 seconds. \n"
