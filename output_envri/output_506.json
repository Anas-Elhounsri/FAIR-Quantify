        "value": "Youth unemployment is a global problem that has a major negative impact on economic and social life. However, as the topic of youth unemployment rises, it becomes more and more meaningful to talk about the reasons of why Japan maintains one of the lowest youth unemployment rates. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the time series of Japanese unemployment rate, specify appropriate econometric models using macroeconomic factors, and to compare these models by forecasting Japanese unemployment rate. The study compiled SARIMA, VAR, and VECM models using OECD Japan quarterly youth unemployment data from 1968 to 2018. Also using data on GDP changes and inflation. All models are appropriate and adequate. However, the SARIMA model is the most appropriate for predicting youth unemployment in Japan. On the other hand, there is a link between youth unemployment and changes in GDP and between unemployment and inflation. Any impulse coming from GDP changes or inflation affects the youth unemployment rate in Japan. The study also found that short-term forecasts are better than long- term ones, and further research is needed to improve model prediction for long-term youth unemployment."
