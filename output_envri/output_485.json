In our case the goal is the prediction for a particular instance, the players are all the feature values of an instance, and the gain is the actual predictions for this instance minus the average predictions for all the instances.\nTo be put simply, shapley values indicate how much a feature value contribute to the prediction. To be more precise, shapley value is the average marginal contribution of a feature value across all possible coalitions. \n"

We see the strong seasonalities in temperature (and also mixed layer depth) in the north and south subtropics, as expected. We also notice that temperature and xCO2 variables have a direct relationship with how important it is in the model. I.e., the further a feature value deviates from average, the stronger of an impact it has on the model in the same direction. This makes sense for the variables xCO2 (dry air mixing ratio of atmospheric CO2) and SST since the higher mixing ratio would imply more pCO2 in the water, and in the subtropics, the pCO2 content tracks the temperature (Takahashi et al., 1993). \\\nOn the other hand, we can see that the chlorophyll anomaly (chl_anom) and the mixed layer depth (mld_clim_log) feature values have almost an inverse relationship with the SHAP values. This makes intuitive sense as biological activity would reduce pCO2 in the water (by taking it in and capturing it as calcium carbonate) and a deeper mixed layer would mix the surface pCO2 deeper into the water, which reduces the amount at the surface. \\\nAn interesting takeaway is how the seasonalities become less apparent in the tropics, which again makes sense because there is simply less seasonality there. However, we see in the next plot below (from the starter code, linked here) that this is a region where the model has some inaccuracies as well. Therefore, it is possible that the lack of seasonality accuracy in the tropics for the model arises simply due to a lack of seasonality of the features themselves.in all these regions.  \n"

We decided to focus on the areas where there is the least seasonal correlation : the tropics and the south. The tropics, as explained earlier, have probably less seasonal correlation due to the physical system itself not showing high seasonality. \\\nNevertheless, there seems to be a discrepancy in the south sub-tropical region as well. Interestingly, if we refer back to our seasonal plots, we see that one of the most important variables in the south is the chlorophyll anomaly. This variable shows a seasonality both in the north and south, but only the north shap values match that seasonality. This is visualized further if we look at spatial plots. \\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59796732/169889091-12e20fa9-d9d1-440e-b8dc-c08350403b50.png) \\\nThere is a clear band of high chl_anom (higher biological production) in the south. This band matches with the region where seaonality is not accurately reflected in our initial plot. Therefore, it is possible that the reconstruction fails to accomodate the seasonality of biological cycles in the southern ocean, and thus result in a failure to accurately capture seasonality of pco2 in its reconstruction.  \n"

With this newly acquired information, we can prioritize the data that requires more precise modelling or to be collected for a better reconstruction of pCO2. Furthermore, the highlighted features validate the use of the Machine Learning models : they capture physical relationships between features that make sense. Finally, analyzing the trends in our features through the SHAP value method allows one to identify the potential failure points in the reconstruction. More specifically, we have showed a potential failure in capturing the importance of the biological activity in the southern ocean, which might explain the poor estimation of seasonality in pCO2. \n \n"
