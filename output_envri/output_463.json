We try as much as possible to keep things simple and straightforward, to the best of our abilities. Please feel free to contact: [Dr. Ekpo Otu](eko@aber.ac.uk) for any issue or concern regarding this work. \n> The [local_appfd_method.py](https://github.com/KoksiHub/APPFD_FK_GMM-Method-For-SHREC-2021-Surface-based-Protein-Domains-Retrieval/blob/main/local_appfd_method.py) contains our baseline algorithm that extracts 6-dimensional hand-crafted local geometric features from the surface of 3D point cloud and computes local Augmented Point-pair Feature Descriptors (APPFD) for Local Surface Patches (LSPs) around a keypoint (or interest point). Some of the supporting functions needed by this algorithm (local APPFD) are presented in [ekpoUtilities.py](https://github.com/KoksiHub/APPFD_FK_GMM-Method-For-SHREC-2021-Surface-based-Protein-Domains-Retrieval/blob/main/ekpoUtilities.py). After we have computed local APPFD 3D shape descriptors for each 3D model in the dataset, these descriptors are agglomerated using a fisher-kernel framework, implemented by a function in [fisher_vector.py](https://github.com/KoksiHub/APPFD_FK_GMM-Method-For-SHREC-2021-Surface-based-Protein-Domains-Retrieval/blob/main/fisher_vector.py) - following the training and fitting of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on combined locally-computed APPFDs for all database objects/models. \n> Additionally, we present a Jupyter notebook: [SHREC2021_ProteinDomainsRetrieval_Track4.ipynb](#) to demonstrate some essential steps in this implementation and explain the stages on the APPFD algorithm, as well as the APPFD-FK-GMM method. **[Click Here](https://github.com/KoksiHub/APPFD_FK_GMM-Method-For-SHREC-2021-Surface-based-Protein-Domains-Retrieval/blob/main/SHREC2021_ProteinDomainsRetrieval_Track4.ipynb)** to access the Notebook.\n> \n \n"

To compare proteins at the domain level for similarities is a common task in structural biology, biochemistry or drug discovery. Proteins can be described as non-rigid surfaces representing their solvent-excluded surface (SES) as defined by Connoly (Connoly et al., J Appl Cryst. 1983). Additional, biologically-relevant information can be provided, such as electrostatics, to further describe these molecular shapes. \n> The above track proposes a set of representation for the conformational space of 10 query domains, extracted from the PFAM database (El-Geabli et al., NAR, 2019) as well as 554 surfaces of multi-domain proteins. Compared to the previous Protein Shape Retrieval contests, this track aims to focus on the evaluation of the performance to retrieve 10 individual domains among a set of 554 multi-domains protein surfaces. \n> Ten individual domains involved in protein-protein (7 domains) or protein-DNA (3 domains) were extracted from the PFAM database, and a representative structure of each of these domains were be provided to the participants as query for the retrieval task. \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "We approach this retrieval challenge by first computing a novel, knowledged-based 3D shape descriptor, the Augmented Point-pair Features Descriptor (APPFD) which is based on the extraction of 6-dimensional local hand-crafted features from keypoint regions (i.e. Local Surface Patches - LSP or regions) on the surface of a given 3D protein model. The final APPFD involves bucketing each of the 6-dimensional locally-extracted features into a 1-dimensional histogram, where number of bins, ***B = 35***. The resulting APPFD for each keypoint or LSP is a ***210-dimensional*** vector. Next, we agglomerate all computed local APPFD into a single compact code or representation, using the Fisher-Kernel (FK) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) framework. The final 3D shape descriptor we present for each input 3D protein model is therefore a novel 3D shape descriptor called APPFD-FK-GMM, which is a 1-dimensional feature vector (***fv***) - compact and highly discriminative against different protein domains. \n> We provide a simple and straightforward implementation pipeline for the APPFD-FK-GMM 3D shape retrieval/classification method in this **[Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/KoksiHub/APPFD_FK_GMM-Method-For-SHREC-2021-Surface-based-Protein-Domains-Retrieval/blob/main/SHREC2021_ProteinDomainsRetrieval_Track4.ipynb)**. \n> Comparing of two different protein models or domains, is reduced to finding the spatial distance/(dis)similarity between their final APPFD-FK-GMM descriptors. \nThis repository, therefore contains full code implementation of the APPFD-FK-GMM 3D shape retrieval (and classification) method. Detained description of the implementation are also provided below.\n \n"
