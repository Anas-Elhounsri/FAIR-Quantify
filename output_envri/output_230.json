We identified 20 topics and counted the number of grants in each topic that fell in a funding quartile (see table below; counts were from a test subset of the full dataset). We highlight a few topics associated with high or low funding:\n  * Grants associated with *child obesity/diabetes* research were the most common highly funded research topic, with 1635 grants funded in the top 75th quartile compared to 619 in the bottom 25th quartile. \n  * Although fewer total *HIV* grants were funded compared to child obesity, an HIV proposal is almost 4x as likely to be in the top 75th quartile compared to the bottom 25th quartile (706:192). \n  * Suprisingly, *cancer research* proposals were almost 2.5x more likely to be funded in the bottom 25th quartile (1119 cancer grants) compared to the upper 75th quartile (459 grants).\n  * Also surprising given the hype around large-scale sequencing, *genetics and genomics* research had more grants funded in the bottom 25th quartile than any other group. \nresearch topic               |  <$319,102.5  |  $319,102.5-$371,250  |  $371,250-$464,929.5  |  >$464,929.5\n-----------------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------\nbacteriology                 |  308          |  300                 |  437                 |  244\ncancer cell biology          |  766          |  829                 |  799                 |  313\ncancer research              |  1072         |  692                 |  387                 |  459\ncardiac research             |  118          |  244                 |  493                 |  269\ncell signaling               |  380          |  373                 |  318                 |  123\nchild obesity/diabetes       |  521          |  411                 |  550                 |  1635\nclinical research            |  1078         |  1021                |  1016                |  1613\ndrug development             |  951          |  555                 |  414                 |  249\ngene expression              |  479          |  447                 |  455                 |  369\ngenetics and genomics        |  550          |  354                 |  265                 |  388\nhiv                          |  159          |  133                 |  284                 |  706\nhuman disease mechanisms     |  1404         |  1655                |  1449                |  643\nkidney research and imaging  |  341          |  361                 |  283                 |  432\nliver research               |  118          |  177                 |  114                 |  70\nlung research                |  209          |  374                 |  497                 |  295\nneuroscience                 |  567          |  978                 |  909                 |  603\nparasitology (malaria)       |  69           |  97                  |  130                 |  88\nsleep/ageing                 |  320          |  237                 |  226                 |  315\nsubstance abuse/addiction    |  247          |  216                 |  197                 |  469\nvirology                     |  266          |  330                 |  491                 |  405\n   \n* Study section: Grants are reviewed and funded by one of 250 different [study sections](https://public.csr.nih.gov/studysections/Standing/Pages/default.aspx), depending on the research topic, and our trained model identified the study section as the most important predictor of funds. For example, almost 4800 grants funded by the NIH's [special emphasis panels](https://public.era.nih.gov/pubroster/#sep) were in the top 75th quartile of funding compared to only ~2500 that were in the bottom 25th quartile of funding. A grant that is reviewed and accepted by one of these panels thus has a very high chance of being funded. \n* Organization: The organization/institute associated with the grant was also predictive of the proposal's funding quartile; however, given the number of unique organizations (1067), it is difficult to resolve the contribution of any individual organization. \n1.

It weights the frequency of a given term in an individual document with the inverse frequency of that term in the entire corpus. The general idea is that a term that appears in all the documents is unlikely to be useful for identifying individual documents/subjects and is therefore unimportant. A term that appears frequently in a small number of documents, however, is likely very important in distinguishing those documents. We will use tf-idf vectorization to transform our abstract text and perform K-Means clustering. To determine the number of clusters to fit, we can plot the sum of squared errors vs. the number of clusters, commonly known as an elbow plot. \nAlthough the elbow plot suggests that using 40-50 clusters may lead to the best separation of our data, that is a large number of clusters. As we will want to use distance from cluster centroid as features in later predictive modeling, a large number of clusters will lead to a high-dimensional feature space. We therefore initially fit 20 clusters and isolated the top 10 words closest to each cluster centroid, listed below. \nWe can immediately see that K-Means identified different research subjects, such as research regarding addiction and addictive substances (cluster 0) and HIV/AIDS research (cluster 3). This is confirmation that our unsupervised clustering was able to identify structure within our abstract data. \nWe can visualize these data using [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding), which is a non-linear dimensionality technique that can map multi-dimensional clusters to two-dimensional space. We first reduced our dimensions using PCA before running t-SNE: \n"

Let's re-plot the distribution of funds for grants that received less than $1,000,000. \nWe see that most grants receive similar amounts of funding. For our first model, we will attempt to predict which funding group quartile a grant falls into based on tf-idf of the abstracts. Grants will be divided into funding groups as follows: \nDividing the grants in this manner ensures each class has the same number of observations and thus we will not have to worry about class imbalance. Although we will lose some information by grouping grants in this manner rather than running a regression, we want to make predictions based on grant abstracts and multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers are good default models that can handle high-dimensional text data. Furthermore, because most grant funds are clustered together, we will not lose too much information. \nThe confusion matrix resulting from fitting a mulitnomial Naive Bayes trained on our tf-idf abstract data is shown below: \nGiven that this is a naive model trained only on abstract text data, our predictions are relatively good. We see that the best predictions by far are for highly funded grants, but the model predicts the true class label for the other funding groups at higher frequencies than the incorrect classes. Furthermore, when our naive classifier mis-classified grants, it tended to predict the adjacent funding group at higher frequencies than a more extreme funding group.\n \n"

Our final model was a random forest trained on these data. Although we can determine which features random forests used to split the data, and therefore which variables were deemed important, it is more difficult to determine how the feature corresponds to our response. We do know that the study section the grant was assigned to as well as the associated organization seem to have a large effect on ultimately how many funds the grant is awarded. Furthermore, the strength of the assignment of a grant to a certain research topic, as measured by Euclidean distance from K-Means cluster centroids, were also important predictors for funding, particulary for the child obesity/diabetes and genetics/genomics clusters. \nOur model is based on only a static snapshot of NIH grants, specifically from grants funded between 2008 and 2016 and would need to be re-trained as more grants are funded. This is particularly true of the unsupervised clustering we performed; in fact, we could possibly get better predictions by fitting more clusters, although the increase in dimensionality may make model training more difficult.  \nAlthough grant information is available from as early as 1985, as of 2017/05/09 when the data was downloaded abstracts were only available from 2008 and later. As of 2017/06 it seems the NIH may have [updated](https://exporter.nih.gov/ExPORTER_Catalog.aspx) these earlier grants to include abstracts and to fix DUNS numbers. It would be interesting to investigate these earlier grants and see if grant funding and abstracts have changed over time.\n \n"
