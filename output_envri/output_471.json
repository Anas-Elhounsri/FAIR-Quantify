How can researchers distill complex, nuanced research results into a friendly and easy-to-understand format for others? <i>Jupyter Notebooks</i>, documents that are part text, media, and code that can be placed online ([Kluyver et al., 2016](http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/42900)), are an effective visualization educational tool for conveying ideas and research results ([Barba & Forsyth, 2018](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00021.pdf); [Freeman et al., 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B5ujlJ92ZQgC6PXO%2BbkuCcQ%3D%3D&utm_source=SwitchUp&utm_medium=Blog)). Part of what makes Jupyter Notebooks effective learning tools is their interactive python widgets, <i>ipywidgets</i>. These widgets can be manipulated so that a user can interact with the Jupyter Notebook. Widgets are commonly used in this set of notebooks to allow a user to manipulate plots. A user can adjust the inputs for an analysis, and changes in the plots are shown in real time. This allows the user to explore concepts visually and gain an intuitive understanding of how various parameters affect a particular outcome. Jupyter Notebooks also have a higher readability and approachability than scientific papers, which tend to be less inviting for non-specialists.\n"

This discovery is not well understood by those outside of the lunar research community, although it has received a decent amount of publicity [[TED](https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_t_stewart_where_did_the_moon_come_from_a_new_theory?language=en) (Stewart, 2019); [Scientific American](https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_t_stewart_where_did_the_moon_come_from_a_new_theory?language=en) (Lock & Stewart, 2019)]. Every new idea takes a while to absorb into the public sphere. Still, those who do know about synestias struggle with grasping the physics of their internal dynamics. This is to be expected; we have no real-life reference for synestias (e.g., telescopic images). We are not familiar with this new type of planetary object, so we don't have any intuition for how a synestia might behave. The physics that can explain how synestias work are unfamiliar to us; what we observe on Earth on a daily basis is very different from how those same objects would behave within a synestia's oblate, high-pressure, high-temperature environment. These notebooks seek to bridge that gap -- to help you analyze and gain intuition about the inner workings of synestias so that they seem less esoteric.\n"

However interesting this new discovery may be, much of the public and many researchers are not familiar with synestias and also have diffculty understanding the complex physics that dictate a synestia's behavior. To make learning about synestias more accessible and intuitive, I have developed a set of online Jupyter Notebooks (text, media, and code) for a user to visually explore various physics-based aspects of synestias. In this set of notebooks, a user will learn about: what synestias conceptually look like, the gravitational and extreme thermal profiles of a synestia, the criteria for an object to be a synestia, how synestias form, the balance of forces within a synestia, how gas drag affects moon formation within synestias, and how angular momentum affects the orbital dynamics of moons forming within synestias.\n \n"
