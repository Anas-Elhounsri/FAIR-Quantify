These notebooks are opened in a browser environment and are an open source web application that combines instructional text with live executable and modifyable code for many different programming platforms (e.g., Python, R, Julia). Jupyter notebooks are an ideal tool for teaching programming as they provide the code for a user to execute and they also provide the context and explanation for the code.\n\nThese notebooks used to be Python-specific, and were therefore called iPython notebooks (hence the `*.ipynb` suffix). But Jupyter notebooks now support many programming languages, although the name still pays homage to Python with the vestigal \"py\" in \"Jupyter\". The notebooks execute code from the kernel of the specific programming language on your local machine.\n\nJupyter notebooks capability will be automatically installed with your download of the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python. If you did not download the Anaconda distribution of Python, you can download Jupyter notebooks separately by following the instructions on the Jupyter [install page](http://jupyter.org/install).\n\n"

Be scalable and integrable with other projects and procedures.\n\nBill Gates is credited with the following plea for efficiency and parsimony in code writing.\n\n> \"Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.\"\n\nStrong support for points (2) and (3) is Eagleson's Law.\n\n> \"Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else.\"\n\nBecause of the latter two characteristics, Python code has developed some conventions and best practices, some of which have been institutionalized in the [PEP 8--Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (\"PEP\" stands for Python Enhancement Proposals). Key examples PEP 8 Python coding conventions are the following.\n\n* Indents should be 4 spaces (not tab)\n* Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters long blocks of text being limited to 72 characters (Evans limits all his lines to 72 characters)\n* Use a space after a comma\n* Use a space before and after arithmetic operators\n\nIn the text editors Atom, Sublime Text 3, and Vim, you can install Linter packages that highlight areas of your code that break PEP 8 rules and tell you what the violation is.\n\nThere are fewer conventions in docstring structure, but we have developed some of our own that are outlined in the [PythonFuncs.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2019/blob/master/Tutorials/PythonFuncs.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.
