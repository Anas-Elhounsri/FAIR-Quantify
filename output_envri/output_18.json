        "value": "# Code of Conduct\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the **Spotify FOSS** community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.\n\nOur open source community strives to:\n\n- **Be friendly and patient.**\n- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.\n- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It\u2019s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n- **Be careful in the words that we choose**: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.\n- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we\u2019re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re wrong. Don\u2019t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn\u2019t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.\n\n## Definitions\n\nHarassment includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation\n- Unwelcome comments regarding a person\u2019s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment\n- Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person's gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle\n- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \u201c_hug_\u201d or \u201c_backrub_\u201d) without consent or after a request to stop\n- Threats of violence, both physical and psychological\n- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm\n- Deliberate intimidation\n- Stalking or following\n- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes\n- Sustained disruption of discussion\n- Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour\n- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\n- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease\n- Deliberate \u201couting\u201d of any aspect of a person\u2019s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse\n- Publication of non-harassing private communication\n\nOur open source community prioritizes marginalized people\u2019s safety over privileged people\u2019s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:\n\n- \u2018Reverse\u2019 -isms, including \u2018reverse racism,\u2019 \u2018reverse sexism,\u2019 and \u2018cisphobia\u2019\n- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as \u201cleave me alone,\u201d \u201cgo away,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not discussing this with you\u201d\n- Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts\n- Communicating in a \u2018tone\u2019 you don\u2019t find congenial\n- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n### Diversity Statement\n\nWe encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.\n\nAlthough this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected\ncharacteristics above, including participants with disabilities.\n\n### Reporting Issues\n\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior\u2014or have any other concerns\u2014please report it by contacting us via **fossboard@spotify.com**. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:\n\n- Your contact information.\n- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please\n  include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.\n- Any additional information that may be helpful.\n\nAfter filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\n### Attribution & Acknowledgements\n\nWe all stand on the shoulders of giants across many open source communities.

        "value": "# How to Contribute\n\nWe'd love to get patches from you!\n\n## Workflow\n\nWe follow the [GitHub Flow\nWorkflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)\n\nBelow is an Example.\n\n1.  Fork the project\n1.  Check out the `main` branch\n1.  Create a feature branch\n1.  Write code and tests for your change\n1.  From your branch, make a pull request against\n`spotify-research/tdsurv/main`\n1.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed\n1.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `spotify-research/tdsurv/main`\n1.  Delete your feature branch\n\n## Style\n\nWe follow `black` style.\n\n## Issues\n\nWhen creating an issue please try to adhere to the following format:\n\n    tdsurv: One line summary of the issue (less than 72 characters)\n\n    ### Expected behavior\n\n    As concisely as possible, describe the expected behavior.\n\n    ### Actual behavior\n\n    As concisely as possible, describe the observed behavior.\n\n    ### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n\n    List all relevant steps to reproduce the observed behavior.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n\nComments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.\n\nFiles should be exempt of trailing spaces.\n\nWe adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit\nmessages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80\ncolumns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).\n\n    tdsurv: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)\n\n    Problem\n\n    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem\n    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be\n    thought of being the motivation for your change.\n\n    Solution\n\n    Describe the modifications you've done.\n\n    Result\n\n    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this\n    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.\n\nSome important notes regarding the summary line:\n\n* Describe what was done; not the result\n* Use the active voice\n* Use the present tense\n* Capitalize properly\n* Do not end in a period \u2014 this is a title/subject\n* Prefix the subject with its scope\n\n## Code Review\n\nThe repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository at\nSpotify. For the most part this process should be transparent to the project\nusers, but it does have some implications for how pull requests are merged into\nthe codebase.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the project\ncommunity (both inside and outside of Spotify), and once the changes are\napproved, your commits will be brought into Spotify's internal system for\nadditional testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed\nback to GitHub with the next sync.\n\nThis process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way.\nInstead a member of the project team will post a message in the pull request\nthread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull\nrequest will be closed.\nThe changes in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the\nauthorship metadata will be preserved.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe also welcome improvements to the project documentation or to the existing\ndocs. Please file an\n[issue](https://github.com/spotify-research/tdsurv/issues).\n\n# License\n\nBy contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the\nterms of the APLv2:\nhttps://github.com/spotify-research/tdsurv/blob/main/LICENSE\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nRead our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for the project.\n"
