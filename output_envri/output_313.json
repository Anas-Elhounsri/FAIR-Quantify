        "value": "Here is the analytics of the research dedicated to pharmaceuticals' impact on natural environments with a focus on soils. \nThe problem of contamination of the environment by pharmaceuticals and products of personal care and hygiene (PPCP) is globally well recognised nowadays due to the rising emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The largest part of pharmaceuticals entering natural media affects water resources at first, so most of the research is focused on the effects accompanying the pollution of water ecosystems. Another serious aspect of this problem is the introduction of PPCP into soils -- the largest pool of the global biodiversity, one of the major regulators of the global carbon and nutrient cycle, and the source of natural pharmaceuticals. Research dedicated to soils is not so often compared to water research. However, it is a valuable knowledge direction for a better understanding of shifts in the biosphere caused by different pollutants along with the development of regulatory actions required by global urgency. \n\nThis analysis is a part of the systematic review \"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products reshaping soil ecosystem functioning\" prepared for the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal. \nThe approach with the provided code example and results can be used for further state-of-the-art analysis on the topic. \n \n"

However, the database collects information on PPCP detected in natural environments, so it is worth taking it into account. \nSome of the limitations resulted in 2 manual manipulations: search of papers with irrelevant matrix (can be fixed with the use of materials and methods section and more sophisticated approach to analysing texts), a search of PPCPs not included in search base (can be fixed by use of another database for comparison).\n \n"
