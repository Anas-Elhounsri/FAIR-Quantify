        "value": "In the coming decade, new observatories will begin operations, enabling extensive large-scale, multi-wavelength sky surveys for significant astrophysical inquiries. A central focus is understanding galaxy formation and evolution, exemplified by the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with observations starting in 2024. LSST will yield vast data volumes, with many images and catalogs being produced on short timescales, demanding innovative solutions for efficient processing. Machine Learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, offer the ability to improve and automate many of these data processes. To prepare for LSST-like surveys, we utilize deep neural networks in order to classify 3 galaxy morphologies in simulated LSST-like images of different quality, accounting for realistic observing degradations like noise. In addition to standard convolutional networks, we explore utilizing Bayesian neural networks, capable of quantifying uncertainty in the parameters of a model and, consequently, of its predictions. Notably, we find that networks trained on noisy early-release data struggle with less noisy subsequent-release data, but transfer learning techniques mitigate this. This emphasizes the need for realistic simulated data in machine learning model development, bridging the gap between simulated and real observations. Further research is warranted, especially refining Bayesian models to provide accurate uncertainties for simulated LSST-like images. As such methods become standard for future surveys, robust models must transition smoothly between simulated and real data, accommodating successive data releases from the same telescopes.\n \n"
