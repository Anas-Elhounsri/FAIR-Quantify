        "value": "Carbon is decentralized exchange infrastructure that gives users the ability to create automated flexible trading strategies on-chain. Its key technical features are adjustable parametric bonding curves, asymmetric concentrated liquidity, and an efficient routing algorithm. \nThis simulator has been developed by **Bancor Research** to assist in the design, testing, and validation of Carbon strategies. It can be run interactively in a Jupyter notebook environment, or via Python scripting. \nThe permament Github URL for this repo is [`bancorprotocol/carbon-simulator`][repo]. There is a second repo that is optimised for [Binder][binderdoc] and that is located at [`bancorprotocol/carbon-simulator-binder`][repob]. The latter uses the version of the library in the [PyPi package][pypi], so it may be a week or two behind. The Carbon project website is at [carbondefi.xyz][carbon]. On this site you will find in particular the [litepaper][litepaper], [whitepaper][whitepaper], and [information disclosure][patent] for the patent application. The simulator in its latest released version can also be accessed as JupyterLite version at [`simulator.bancordefi.xyz`][jupylite]. The associated repo is at [`bancorprotocol/carbon-simulator-jupylite`][jlrepo]. \n"

If you are using them in your own code, we recomend copying the module(s) you are using into your own codebase.  \nThe in-library location of those objects is _not_ part of the API, they need to be imported from the top level. There may be additional objects in the top-level of the library that are not currently considered part of the API. As of version 1.0, those objects are `ExactRouterX0Y0N` and `analytics` which we do not currently consider in a state suitable for semantic versioning.  \nModules may have version numbers of their own. Those are mostly for use of the dev team and they do not follow any specific policies. \n"
