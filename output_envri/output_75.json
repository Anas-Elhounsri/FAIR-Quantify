The total absence of this data precluded analyses that are critical for monitoring the ecosystem and empirically studying mining and network phenomena. Since these types of records are not on the blockchain itself, they are lost to the sands of time unless intentionally preserved. The Noncesense archival network's central mission is to ensure that we are always collecting and analyzing this key information.\n\nThe Noncesense archival network employs custom archival daemons that collect data from orphaned blocks/chains along with notes from the node itself. Nodes are deployed globally using virtual private servers (VPS) to capture a broader view of the network and enable representative analyses.\n"

Ittay Eyal and Emin G\u00fcn Sirer [point out](http://hackingdistributed.com/2014/01/15/detecting-selfish-mining/) that \"One could detect this [phenomenon] by looking at the timestamps on successive blocks in the blockchain. Since mining is essentially an independent random process, we'd expect the interblock time gap to be exponentially distributed. Any deviation from this expectation would be suggestive of selfish mining.\"\n"

In the case that two miners independently mine the same transaction, the {ring members, key image, receiving stealth address} will be mirrored in the two blocks.\n\nIf two versions of a transaction are generated, they will have the same key image, but different one-time recipient stealth address, and different cryptographic signatures. This could occur benignly, if a user regenerates the transaction to the same address (creating a new one-time address in the process). It could also represent a transaction that is being revised to spend to a different recipient. If a double-spend attack is attempted (with or without majority, with or without success), the miner will necessarily have to include a transaction with the same key image, but a different receiving stealth address and signature. While this might happen occasionally due to wallets or users refreshing transactions, an alternative block with several redirected transactions strongly suggests an intentional attempted double-spend attack.\n"
