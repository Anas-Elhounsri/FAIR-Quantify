We chose five of those gases to have our model predict: CO2, H2O, N2, CH4, O2. \nWhile the data set was clean, there was one significant obstacle. 10,000 rows was not enough data to learn nuanced patterns and, as a result, we used a  **Gaussian Copula Model**  to be able to synthetically create more data. \n\nOur synthetic data generation was very successful as our  **two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test**  gave a high score of  **0.88** .
