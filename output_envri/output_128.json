        "value": "Imagine you have a function you would like to optimize, but you only have access\nto approximate gradients of the function. There are two approaches to\noptimization. On one hand, you could ignore the surrogate gradient information\nentirely and perform zeroth-order optimization, using methods such as\nevolutionary strategies to estimate a descent direction. These methods exhibit\npoor convergence properties when the parameter dimension is large. On the other\nhand, you could directly feed the surrogate gradients to a first-order\noptimization algorithm. However, bias in the surrogate gradients will interfere\nwith optimizing the target problem. Ideally, we would like a method that\ncombines the complementary strengths of these two approaches: we would like to\ncombine the unbiased descent direction estimated with evolutionary strategies\nwith the low-variance estimate given by the surrogate gradient. We propose a\nmethod for doing this called guided evolutionary strategies (Guided ES).\n"

        "value": "Many applications in machine learning require optimizing a function whose true\ngradient is unknown, but where surrogate gradient information (directions that\nmay be correlated with, but not necessarily identical to, the true gradient) is\navailable instead. This arises when an approximate gradient is easier to compute\nthan the full gradient (e.g. in meta-learning or unrolled optimization), or when\na true gradient is intractable and is replaced with a surrogate (e.g. in certain\nreinforcement learning applications, or when using synthetic gradients).\n\nHere, we propose _Guided Evolutionary Strategies_ (Guided ES), a method for\noptimally using surrogate gradient directions along with random search. We\ndefine a search distribution for evolutionary strategies that is elongated along\na guiding subspace spanned by the surrogate gradients. This allows us to\nestimate a descent direction which can then be passed to a first-order\noptimizer.\n\nThis repository contains a colaboratory (colab) notebook with a demo of the\nmethod on a toy problem (described below).\n"

By concentrating our search\nsamples in a low-dimensional subspace where the true gradient has non-negligible\nsupport, we can dramatically reduce the variance of our search direction.\n\nThe figure panel (a) below depicts the geometry underlying our method. Instead\nof the true gradient (blue arrow), we are given a surrogate gradient (white\narrow) which is correlated with the true gradient. We use this to form a guiding\ndistribution (denoted with white contours) and use this to draw samples (white\ndots) which we use as part of a random search procedure.\n\n![Schematic of guided evolutionary\nstrategies](images/fig1.png?raw=true \"Schematic of guided evolutionary strategies\")\n\nIn panel (b), we demonstrate the performance of the method on a toy problem. The\nproblem consists of a random quadratic function, where we add an explicit bias\nand random noise to the gradient. Following the gradient directly with SGD\n(orange curve) starts fast but starts to diverge due to the bias in the\ngradient. Performing evolutionary strategies (or an adaptive variant, CMA-ES)\nsucceed in minimizing the true function but proceed slowly and ignore the\ngradient information.\n\nGuided ES, on the other hand, combines the strengths of these two approaches.\n"
