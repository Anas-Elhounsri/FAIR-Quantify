The data was provided by through the link (under the name HospitalCosts):\nhttp://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/jfreesbooks/Regression%20Modeling/BookWebDec2010/data.html \nIn this case study, I have performed the Descriptive Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Analysis to fullfill the foloowing goals of this project: \n* To record the patient statistics, the agency wants to find the age category of people who frequent the hospital and has the maximum  expenditure.\n* In order of severity of the diagnosis and treatments and to find out the expensive treatments, the agency wants to find the diagnosis related group that has maximum hospitalization and expenditure.\n* To make sure that there is no malpractice, the agency needs to analyze if the race of the patient is related to the hospitalization costs.\n* To properly utilize the costs, the agency has to analyze the severity of the hospital costs by age and gender for proper allocation of resources.\n* Since the length of stay is the crucial factor for inpatients, the agency wants to find if the length of stay can be predicted from age, gender, and race.\n* To perform a complete analysis, the agency wants to find the variable that mainly affects the hospital costs.\n \n"
