Note that the total runtime is about 27k CPU hours, but that includes 100 random seed replicates.\n\nYou don't need to run our pipeline if you are simply interested in comparing to our results or running alternative analyses. You can download the [raw data (188 MB)](https://storage.googleapis.com/neural-structural-optimization-public/all_losses.nc) from Google Cloud Storage. See the [\"Analysis of optimization results\" notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/neural-structural-optimization/blob/master/notebooks/analyze-results.ipynb) for how we processed this data to create the figures and table in our paper.\n"
