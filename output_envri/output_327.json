        "value": "`spyglass` is a data analysis framework that facilitates the storage, analysis,\nvisualization, and sharing of neuroscience data to support reproducible\nresearch. It is designed to be interoperable with the NWB format and integrates\nopen-source tools into a coherent framework. \nFeatures of Spyglass include: \n- **Standardized data storage** - Spyglass uses the open-source\n    [Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N)](https://www.nwb.org/)\n    format to ingest and store processed data. NWB:N is a standard set by the\n    BRAIN Initiative for neurophysiological data\n    ([R\u00fcbel et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.78362)).\n- **Reproducible analysis** - Spyglass uses [DataJoint](https://datajoint.com/)\n    to ensure that all analysis is reproducible. DataJoint is a data management\n    system that automatically tracks dependencies between data and analysis\n    code. This ensures that all analysis is reproducible and that the results\n    are automatically updated when the data or analysis code changes.\n- **Common analysis tools** - Spyglass provides easy usage of the open-source\n    packages [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface),\n    [Ghostipy](https://github.com/kemerelab/ghostipy), and\n    [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) for common analysis\n    tasks. These packages are well-documented and have active developer\n    communities.\n- **Interactive data visualization** - Spyglass uses\n    [figurl](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/figurl) to create interactive\n    data visualizations that can be shared with collaborators and the broader\n    community. These visualizations are hosted on the web and can be viewed in\n    any modern web browser. The interactivity allows users to explore the data\n    and analysis results in detail.\n- **Sharing results** - Spyglass enables sharing of data and analysis results\n    via [Kachery](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-cloud), a\n    decentralized content addressable data sharing platform. Kachery Cloud\n    allows users to access the database and pull data and analysis results\n    directly to their local machine.\n- **Pipeline versioning** - Processing and analysis of data in neuroscience is\n    often dynamic, requiring new features. Spyglass uses *Merge tables* to\n    ensure that analysis pipelines can be versioned. This allows users to easily\n    use and compare results from different versions of the analysis pipeline\n    while retaining the ability to access previously generated results.\n- **Cautious Delete** - Spyglass uses a `cautious delete` feature to ensure that\n    data is not accidentally deleted by other users. When a user deletes data,\n    Spyglass will first check to see if the data belongs to another team of\n    users. This enables teams of users to work collaboratively on the same\n    database without worrying about accidentally deleting each other's data. \n"
