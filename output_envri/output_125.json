By quantitatively linking these data into a single framework, we recover a final inverted model that reproduces the observed, or desired, petrophysical and geological features while fitting the geophysical data. In the hope of facilitating this exploration and promoting reproducibility of geophysical simulations and inversions, we make the scripts of those examples publicly available thanks to the open source software package, SimPEG. This allows researchers to interrogate all of the components and to facilitate the exploration of our new inversion strategies. We highlight different capabilities of our methodology by inverting magnetotelluric and DC resistivity data in 1D and 2D respectively. Finally we apply our framework to inverting airborne over frequency domain data, acquired in Australia, for the detection and characterization of saline contamination of freshwater.\n"

We perform PGI over various examples: a 1D MT layered-earth, a DC profile over 2 cylinders, a stitched FDEM survey for saline water intrusion\r\n\r\n**Contents**\r\nThere are 3 notebooks in this repository:\r\n\r\n**1_MT_PGI_Sharp_Smooth.ipynb:**\r\nMagnetotelluric data are acquired over a layered-earth that has sharp and smooth features. The PGI algorithm is provided with the true petrophysical distribution and the goal is to use it along with the MT data to find a solution that has the desired contrast features.\r\n\r\n**2_DC_PGI_2cylinders.ipynb:**\r\nA DC resistivity profile is acquired over two cylinders. We illustrate the performance of this framework when no physical property mean values are available, and compared it to the result with full petrophysical information. We highlight then how geological information from borehole logs can be incorporated into this framework.\r\n\r\n**3_FDEM_PGI_Bookpurnong.ipynb**\r\nThis example illustrates an application of the PGI approach on a field frequency-domain EM dataset, in conjunction with a structurally constraining regularization, without using extensive geological or petrophysical information. We demonstrate how to use this framework to test hypothesis, such as a recovering a specific number of distinct units, and to build confidence, or doubts, in geological features displayed by the inversions.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n0.0.4: Stricter Requirements for reproducibility",
