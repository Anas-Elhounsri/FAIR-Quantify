        "value": "Recent studies show that the vigorous seasonal cycle of the mixed layer modulates \nupper-ocean submesoscale turbulence. \nHere we provide model-based evidence that the seasonally-changing upper-ocean \nstratification in the Kuroshio Extension also modulates submesoscale (here 10-100 km) \ninertia-gravity waves. Summertime re-stratification weakens submesoscale \nturbulence but enhances inertia-gravity waves near the surface. Thus, \nsubmesoscale turbulence and inertia-gravity waves undergo vigorous out-of-phase \nseasonal cycles. These results imply a strong seasonal modulation of \nthe accuracy of geostrophic velocity diagnosed from submesoscale \nsea-surface height delivered by the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) \nsatellite mission.\n \n"
