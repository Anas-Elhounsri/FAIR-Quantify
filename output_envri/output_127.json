        "value": "In June 2020, Wattpad (an online platform for reading and writing stories) was hacked, and the personal information and passwords of 270 million users was revealed. This data breach is unique in that it connects unstructured text data (user descriptions and statuses) to corresponding passwords. Other data breaches (such as from the dating websites Mate1.com and Ashley Madison) share this property, but we had trouble ethically accessing them. This kind of data is particularly well-suited for refining a large text transformer like GPT-3, and it's what sets our research apart from a previous study[^1] which created a framework for generating targeted guesses using **structured** pieces of user information.\n    \nThe original dataset's passwords were hashed with the bcrypt algorithm, so we used data from the crowdsourced password recovery website Hashmob to match plain text passwords with corresponding user information.\n    \n> ### GPT-3 and Language Modeling\n>\n> A language model is a machine learning model that can look at part of a sentence and predict the next word. The most famous language models are smartphone keyboards that suggest the next word based on what you've already typed.\n>\n> GPT-3, or Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, is an artificial intelligence created by OpenAI in February 2019. GPT-3 can translate text, answer questions, summarizes passages, and generate text output on an incredibly sophisticated level. It comes in multiple versions with varying complexity \u2013 we used the smallest model \"Ada\". \nUsing GPT-3's fine-tuning API, we showed a pre-existing text transformer model 10 thousand examples for how to correlate a user's personal information with their password. \nUsing targeted guesses greatly increases the likelihood of not only guessing a target's password, but also guessing passwords that are similar to it. We generated 20 guesses each for 1000 user examples to compare our approach with a brute-force, non-targeted method. The **Levenshtein distance algorithm** shows how similar each password guess is to the real user password. In the first figure above, it may seem that the brute-force method produces more similar passwords on average, but our model has a higher density for Levenshtein ratios of 0.7 and above (the more significant range). \nNot only are the targeted guesses more similar to the target's password, but the model is also able to guess more passwords than brute-forcing, and in significantly fewer tries. The second figure shows that our model is often able to guess the target's password in **fewer than 10 tries**, whereas the brute-forcing method performs less consistently.\n        \n## Demo\n    \nWe created an interactive web demo that shows you what our model thinks your password could be. The back end is built with Flask and directly calls the OpenAI Completion API with our fine-tuned model to generate password guesses based on the inputted personal information.
