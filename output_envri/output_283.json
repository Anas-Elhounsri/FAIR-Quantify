No. Life is not a coin flip. If you're like 28% of humans, you will go bankrupt.** The mathematical fact for why is called the [Kelly Criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion). But it's not intuitive. \n- [research_papers](research_papers/README.md) - 20+ studies on ranging topics\n  - gambling (health destruction) - how destructive habits and well-being are formed from trading\n  - market structures - how financial markets work\n  - Robinhood (toxicity & regulation) - how Robinhood users lose money by design\n  - WallStreetBets (retail) - how group psychology impacts individual prices and performance\n- [robinhood_loss_screenshots](robinhood_loss_screenshots/README.md) - 50+ images of losses from /r/wallstreetbets.\n  - [cropped_screenshots](robinhood_loss_screenshots/cropped_screenshots/README.md) - 30+ images of losses (cropped) /r/wallstreetbets\n- [robinhood_ux_animations_screenshots](robinhood_ux_animations_screenshots/README.md) - gifs, mp4, and images of Robinhood's beautiful and play user interface.\n- everything else (below) \nEach one of those trades are inherently slightly bad bets. (Your bid is unconditionally lower than the most favorable midpoint price.) \nThese losses compound quickly. As a daytrader, there is pressure to make more trades, to justify it as a full-time occupation. \n> Your grandmother does not see smoking as a single event, but as a activity...\n> Risk-taking (trading) is an activity, not a single event.

That's for you to decide and if you want to action, all things considered. You can read academics paper arguing for regulation in \"research_papers\" folder. \nAssume they're lying, lucky, new (not sufficient data), etc.. Assume it's not you. \nIf GOOGL is $100, but you sell a $110 call option, your chance of profiting is high. But your risk is proportionally high. Your potential loss is enormous if GOOGL goes to $120. - Ultimately, the risk/reward will always be slightly negative (but lead major losses long-run). It's why market makers (eg Citadel pay to be the counterpart for your trade. \n"
