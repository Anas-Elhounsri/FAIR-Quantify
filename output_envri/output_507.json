A total of 70 per cent of people die. Millions of lives can be saved by early, precise diagnosis, and the survival rate can be raised even higher. An electrocardiogram measures the electrical impulses produced by the heart (ECG). The ECG signal contains many disturbances and baseline wandering, and it must be processed in order to retrieve the information of each wave, such as P, Q, R, S, T, and, on rare occasions, U. Signal processing is very important for feature extraction and noise reduction. The primary goal of this research is to find diversions and deviations in any region of the wave, particularly the ST segment with elevation or lengthening, which accurately indicates myocardial infarction. The information that has been processed can be used in clinical trials. This paper focuses on data cleaning and pre-processing chores on the PTB-XL data-set, as well as feature extraction for training Deep Learning models for detecting myocardial infarction location and severity. For reading, extracting, and denoising the time series data, a variety of Python Tool-kits have been used."
