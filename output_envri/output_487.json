        "value": "3.1 Bitcoin Market Data\nSimilar to traditional stock exchanges, bitcoins are traded on a bitcoin exchange in multiple \ufb01at currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies. We have chosen to use exchange rates on Bit\ufb01nex (Bitcoin versus USD) as it is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The data was obtained from the database Quandl for ease of collection and returns transformation using their API. Bitcoin prices are transformed into log returns and tested for stationarity using the Dickey-Fuller test to accommodate the required statistical properties for more accurate test results (e.g. Granger-Causality Analysis). \n3.2 Google Search Interests\nOne source of alternative data would be in the form of web searches. Google is the most-used search engine on the World Wide Web and handles 3 billion searches each day. A free service called Google Trends displays how often a particular search-term is searched for relative to the total number of searches for their search engine. Our group selected the keyword \u201cBitcoin\u201d and retrieved the weekly search interest data from the Google Trends API. \n3.3 Twitter Sentiment Data\nTwitter is a social media network which has grown rapidly as an important tool for businesses and individuals to share comments and information including \ufb01nancial news and investment decisions. Prior research by Bollen, Mao and Zeng (2011) has shown that the emotional content of tweets can be useful in predicting market movements. As a rich source of real-time alternative data, sentiment of the information di\ufb00used through Twitter can be useful in determining the overall market perspective towards cryptocurrency and bitcoin. \n3.3.1 Twitter historical data\nFor the collection of historical tweets within our speci\ufb01ed timeframe, our team utilised a python library called \u201cTwitterScraper\u201d to retrieve a sample size of approximately 10,000 tweets a month based on the selected keywords \u201cbitcoin\u201d and \u201cBTC\u201d. We were able to extract a total of 152,293 tweets which were then \ufb01ltered by popular Bitcoin in\ufb02uencers to reduce the noise for a total of 38,936 tweets and resampled into weekly data for sentiment analysis. \n3.3.2 Sentiment Analysis Tool \u2013 VADER\nValence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool suited towards analysing and quantifying social media text sentiments. The algorithm detects the polarity and intensity of sentiments in texts and generates a normalized sentiment score between -1 (most negative) and +1 (most positive). By putting the weekly resampled Twitter historical data through the sentiment analysis tool, we were able to derive the overall weekly Twitter sentiment based on the sample data retrieved. \n3.4 Pageviews\nWeb tra\ufb03c and pageviews can also be another source of alternative data. Pageviews record the total number of times a webpage is visited within a selected time period. Estimations of pageviews for Coinbase.com, a highly reputable bitcoin exchange, during the investigation period were downloaded using Alexa which is an analysis software developed by Amazon.com. The number of pageviews would be an indicator of the general trend of investors\u2019 interests in bitcoin prices during the period. \n3.5 Bitcoin Unique Address Used\nTo receive bitcoin payments, users are required to create Bitcoin addresses to direct payments from their counterparties. The number of bitcoin unique addresses used for each period can then be utilised as a measure of individual transaction data for that period. This information is provided by Blockchain.info which deals in Bitcoin statistics and market information, and retrieved using Quandl\u2019s API.\n \n"

On a more important note, what distinguishes our research from other paper is the fact that we use Bitcoin returns instead of price. \nPrices are, unfortunately, not stationary and persistent of \u2018shocks\u2019 will be many in a non-stationary series. Shocks are evident in the price history of Bitcoin and as such we use Bitcoin returns that allow shocks to the system to gradually die away. This also eliminates any attribution to spurious regressions: if two variables are trending over time, a regression of one on the other could have a high R2 even if the two are unrelated. In addition, when running regressions, it is not possible to validly undertake hypothesis tests about the regression parameters if data are stationary. We then carried out the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test as con\ufb01rmation that Bitcoin returns follow a stationary process.\n \n"

        "original_header": "Conclusion",
        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "In conclusion, our results showed that Google Trends interest levels, Coinbase pageviews and unique Bitcoin addresses used per day displayed positive correlation with Bitcoin returns. Unique Bitcoin addresses used per day showed the greatest R-squared value of 0.154 and the highest correlation with a coe\ufb03cient of 0.393. The economic intuition behind this is reasonable as investors are likely to make more transactions as Bitcoin prices increase. In any case, increases in daily Bitcoin addresses usage indicate an increase in transaction volume which could preclude short-term \ufb02uctuations in Bitcoin prices. \nWe then went further to determine if these factors are \u201cdeterminants\u201d or Granger-causes of Bitcoin returns. Our results showed that Coinbase PageViews displayed greatest signi\ufb01cance with a lag of one week. Surprisingly, the results for Google Trends and unique Bitcoin address used per day were not signi\ufb01cant Granger-causes to Bitcoin returns after all. Coinbase PageViews is likely to be a Granger-cause to Bitcoin returns as investors will often access an exchange before carrying out bitcoin transactions. \nContrary to earlier papers which discovered positive correlations between tweet sentiments and Bitcoin prices, our \ufb01ndings showed that there were no signi\ufb01cant results to be found. After looking deeper into the extracted tweets data however, we discovered that a considerable amount of tweets were irrelevant to Bitcoin (e.g. advertisements, unrelated topics like football tagged with BTC hashtags, etc.). With the growing popularity of Bitcoin, many are keen on taking the opportunity to gain more social media attention by tagging their tweets with \u201c]Bitcoin\u201d or \u201c]BTC\u201d. That being said, our research also faces limitations in our chosen sentiment analysis tool (VADER) and the volume of tweets scraped. The sentiment analysis tool (VADER) faces di\ufb03culties in interpreting the sentiment of sarcastic tweets as well as pictorial references. Also, the accessibility changes to Twitter\u2019s API has made it considerably more di\ufb03cult to access the actual population of historical tweets data. \nTo improve upon our research, we would use daily Bitcoin returns and data collected on a data basis (this information is currently not accessible for Google trends as Google limits the information to weekly data). This may provide a more precise perspective of Granger-causality when utilized for development of a predictive model. The one week lag time may not be realistic as investors often react in a matter of minutes or hours to news and price changes on \ufb01nancial exchanges. For Twitter sentiment analysis, we would be keen on using a better sentiment analysis tool and a properly cleaned set of data for our research.\n \n"
