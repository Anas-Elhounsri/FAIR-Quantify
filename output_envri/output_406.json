No longer are we limited to a mode of map-making that is dominated by industry giants like Google and ESRI. Instead, a suite of data-science tools have matured to a point where they can produce similar, if not, more powerful and creative ways that advance spatial exploration. \r\n\r\nOur understanding of social phenomena through spatial constructs in urban data allows us to address questions on social justice, the environment, transportation, community development and design, amongst many other themes, and how these factors may affect different population groups in different ways. This course prepares  you for challenges in urban data beyond off-the-shelf cartographic approaches. It looks at the various components of data\u2019s journey\u2014acquisition, exploration, modeling, and communication through visualization\u2014and how it enables and advances your research from a data science perspective.\r\n\r\nThe goal for this course is to expose you to the foundations of spatial data science. Where once there was a dearth of available digital information, we now live in a world of too much data. How can these data be transformed to human expressions and narratives that are utilized in planning? We begin with an introduction to various data science tools, and review the basics of programming with Python. Once a foundation of Python programming and data wrangling is achieved, spatial analysis through Python Libraries, and subsequently, through advanced geoprocessing will be introduced. All lessons will be based on \u201creal\u201d data with analytical methods addressing relevant and contemporary urban problems. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.\r\n\r\nWhile there are no prerequisites for taking this course, people who are approaching programming for the first time will admittedly find the course to be intense and challenging.\r\n\r"

The timestamp on the files on your github account will be used to determine whether they were submitted on time. Any late assignments will be marked down.\r\n- **Cleanliness**: Nobody wants to go through unreadable code! Make sure to document your work accordingly, providing markdown cells and comments throughout.\r\n- **Does it work?**: Unless you purposefully created code cells that produce errors to make a point, notebook assignments must run from top to bottom without any errors. Verify this by restarting the kernel, and running all cells.\r\n- **Thinking out of the box**: It is easy to copy an existing notebook, and replace datasets and parameters to fulfill an assignment. But how well have you/your group grasped the underlying concepts? This can be demonstrated by your ability to think outside the box, and *applying* rather than *copying* each step of a given assignment. For example, you may experiment with functions not demonstrated in class, or create your own workflow that borrows certain concepts learned in class to make them your own.\r\n\r"

Alternatively, you may turn your camera off if more privacy is required.\r\n- Parents or caregivers who anticipate having a child(ren) with them during class sessi ons are encouraged to wear a headset to help minimize background noise. You may mute your microphone and communicate through the chat feature at any point necessary.\r\n- Stepping away momentarily for childcare reasons is completely understandable and expected.
