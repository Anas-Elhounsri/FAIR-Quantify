Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be\nfurther defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\nThis Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project\nSteward has a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a\nnegative impact on the project or its community.\n\n## Conflict Resolution\n\nWe do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement\noften yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or\nto engage in behavior that violates the project\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nIf you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address\nthe behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly\nand easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their\ndispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the\nbehavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing\nan environment where participants feel welcome and safe.\n\nReports should be directed to Yusef Shafi (yusef@google.com), the\nProject Steward(s) for Pandemic Sim. It is the Project Steward\u2019s duty to\nreceive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. They will then\nwork with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source\nPrograms Office and the Google Open Source Strategy team. If for any reason you\nare uncomfortable reaching out to the Project Steward, please email\nopensource@google.com.\n\nWe will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.\nWe will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported\nincidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from\nthe project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the\nreport and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken.\nThe identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report\nsupplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing\nharassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,\navailable at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\n"

Before we can take them, we have to jump a\ncouple of legal hurdles.\n\nPlease fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement\n(CLA).\n\n*   If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you\n    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an\n    [individual CLA](https://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).\n*   If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,\n    then you'll need to sign a\n    [corporate CLA](https://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).\n\nFollow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and\ninstructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to\naccept your pull requests.\n\n***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed\nthe CLA can be accepted into the main repository.\n\n### Contributing code\n\nIf you have improvements to Agent Based Epidemic Sim, send us your pull\nrequests! For those just getting started, GitHub has a\n[howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nAgent Based Epidemic Sim team members will be assigned to review your pull\nrequests. Once the pull requests are approved and pass continuous integration\nchecks, a Agent Based Epidemic Sim team member will apply `ready to pull` label\nto your change. This means we are working on getting your pull request submitted\nto our internal repository. After the change has been submitted internally, your\npull request will be merged automatically on GitHub.\n\nIf you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at the\n[issues with the \"contributions welcome\" label](https://github.com/google-research/agent-based-epidemic-sim/labels/stat%3Acontributions%20welcome).\nThese are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside\ncontributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If you\ndecide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that\nyou're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue\ncomment thread to coordinate.\n\n### Contribution guidelines and standards\n\nBefore sending your pull request for\n[review](https://github.com/google-research/agent-based-epidemic-sim/pulls), make sure\nyour changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the Agent Based\nEpidemic Sim coding style.\n\n#### General guidelines and philosophy for contribution\n\n*   Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a)\n    prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking\n    changes to lower the maintenance cost.\n*   Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs\n    usually indicates insufficient test coverage.\n*   Keep API compatibility in mind when you change code in the Agent Based\n    Epidemic Sim framework e.g., code in\n    [agent_based_epidemic_sim/framework](https://github.com/google-research/agent-based-epidemic-sim/tree/develop/agent_based_epidemic_sim).\n    Once Agent Based Epidemic Sim has reached version 1 we will not make\n    non-backward-compatible API changes without a major release. Reviewers of\n    your pull request will comment on any API compatibility issues.\n*   When you contribute a new feature to Agent Based Epidemic Sim, the\n    maintenance burden is (by default) transferred to the Agent Based Epidemic\n    Sim team. This means that benefit of the contribution must be compared\n    against the cost of maintaining the feature.\n\n#### License\n\nInclude a license at the top of new files.\n\nBazel BUILD files also need to include a license section.\n\n#### C++ coding style\n\nChanges to Agent Based Epidemic Sim C++ code should conform to\n[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).\n\nUse `clang-tidy` to check your C/C++ changes. To install `clang-tidy` on\nubuntu:16.04, do:\n\n```bash\napt-get install -y clang-tidy\n```\n\nYou can check a C/C++ file by doing:\n\n```bash\nclang-format <my_cc_file> --style=google > /tmp/my_cc_file.cc\ndiff <my_cc_file> /tmp/my_cc_file.cc\n```\n\n#### Coding style for other languages\n\n*   [Google Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml)\n"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
