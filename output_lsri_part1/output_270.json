        "value": "ReadItAndKeep works by keeping the reads that match the provided target genome.\nTo run on paired Illumina reads, in two files `reads1.fq.gz` and `reads2.fq.gz`, keeping\nonly reads that match the genome in `ref_genome.fasta`:\n\n```\nreadItAndKeep --ref_fasta ref_genome.fasta --reads1 reads1.fq.gz --reads2 reads2.fq.gz -o out\n```\n\nThis will output `out.reads_1.fastq.gz` and `out.reads_2.fastq.gz`.\n\nTo run on one file of nanopore reads `reads.fq.gz`:\n\n```\nreadItAndKeep --tech ont --ref_fasta ref_genome.fasta --reads1 reads.fq.gz -o out\n```\n\nThis will output `out.reads.fastq.gz`.\n\nIf the input reads files are in FASTA format, then it will output reads in FASTA format, calling the files `*.fasta.*` instead of `*.fastq.*`.\n\nIt always writes the counts of input and output reads to `STDOUT` in tab-delimited format, for example:\n\n```\nInput reads file 1\t1000\nInput reads file 2\t1000\nKept reads 1\t950\nKept reads 2\t950\n```\n\nAll logging messages are sent to `STDERR`.\n\n**Required arguments:**\n\n- `--ref_fasta`: reference genome in FASTA format.\n- `--reads1`: at least one reads file in FASTA[.GZ] or FASTQ[.GZ] format.\n- `-o,--outprefix`: prefix of output files.\n\nPlease note there is an option `--tech`, which defaults to `illumina`. Use `--tech ont` for nanopore reads.\n\n**Optional arguments:**\n\n- `--reads2`: name of second reads file, i.e. mates file for paired reads\n- `--enumerate_names`: rename the reads `1`,`2`,`3`,... (for paired reads, will also add `/1` or `/2` on the end of names)\n- `--debug`: debug mode. More verbose and writes debugging files\n- `--min_map_length`: minimum length of match required to keep a read in bp (default `50`)\n- `--min_map_length_pc`: minimum length of match required to keep a read, as a percent of the read length (default `50.0`)\n- `-V,--version`: show version and exit\n\n### Docker\nAdditional arguments need to be supplied to allow Docker to access input and output files. Below is a functional example:\n\n```\ndocker run /path/to/read-it-and-keep/tests:/tests  [-v /path/to/input:/input -v /path/to/output:/output] <TAG> --ref_fasta /tests/MN908947.3.fa --reads1 /input/<SAMPLE>_1.fastq.gz --reads2 /input/<SAMPLE>_2.fastq.gz --outprefix /output/\n```"
