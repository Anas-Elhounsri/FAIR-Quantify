        "description": "## Nextclade 3.8.2\r\n\r\n### Fix detection of number of threads in Nextclade Web\r\n\r\nSometimes Nextclade Web would detect incorrect number of available CPU threads and would create too many processing threads.

Node names are expected to be unique for Auspice visualization to work correctly, so when visualizing the tree Auspice have been renaming these nodes and emitting warnings into browsers' dev console.\n\nIn this version we pick unique names for the auxiliary nodes during placement, so that there are no more warnings. Users may observe changes in some of the node names when inspecting output Auspice JSON file. However, this unlikely to affect most users' work.\n\n### Nextclade Web\n\n### [fix] Ensure dataset \"updated at\" date is displayed in Nextclade Web\n\nSince 3.7.0 Nextclade Web is not showing  \"updated at\" date for any datasets.

We added the missing toggles.\n\n### [fix] Correctly style details/summary component\n\nThe text in details/summary (\"collapse\", \"spoiler\") component (e.g. the list of SC2 lineages) overflowing and producing garbled text in dataset readmes and changelogs.

Nextclade will take pathogen info, genome annotation, reference sequence, and, of course, reference tree from Auspice JSON. No other files are needed. This allows to use almost any Auspice dataset (e.g. from [nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org)) as Nextclade dataset.\n\n- In Nextclade CLI, `--input-dataset` argument now also accepts a path to Auspice JSON file (in addition to accepting the usual paths to a dataset directory and zip archive)\n\n- Nextclade Web now has a new URL parameter `dataset-json-url`, which accepts a URL to Auspice JSON file or even to a dataset URL on nextstrain.org\n\nThis feature is currently in experimental stage.

In this release they are made configurable. One can:\n\n- in CLI: add or omit `index` and `seqName` values when using `--output-columns-selection` argument\n- in Web: tick or untick checkboxes for `index` and `seqName` in \"Column config\" tab of \"Export\" page\n\n#### Add dataset capabilities\n\nThe table in the `nextclade dataset list` command now displays an additional column \"capabilities\", which lists dataset capabilities, i.e. whether dataset contains information allowing clade assignment, QC, etc. The same information is available in JSON format (unstable) if you pass `--json` flag.\n\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n### Installation and usage\n\n\ud83d\udcda Documentation: [docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade)\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Nextclade Web: [clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org)\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Nextclade CLI:\n\n- \ud83d\udce5 Standalone native executables can be downloaded using the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

        "description": "## Nextclade 3.6.0\n\n\n#### Make reference tree node attribute `clade_membership` optional\n\nPreviously Nextclade required clade information to be always present in the input reference tree in the form of the `.node_attrs.clade_membership` field on each tree node. However, for certain datasets we might not have or need clade information. Making such datasets required workarounds, such as adding an empty string to the `clade_membership` field.\n\nIn this version we make `clade_membership` field optional. This allows to make datasets without clades. This is useful when working with organisms for which clades don't make sense or for which the nomenclature is not sufficiently established. This is also useful for dataset authors, who can now bootstrap simple datasets without clades first and then add clades and other features gradually later.\n\nWith this change, if `clade_membership` is not present in the dataset's reference tree nodes, then\n\n - Clade assignment will not run\n\n - Any clade-related functionality will not work\n\n - Output JSON/NDJSON result entries will not contain clade field\n\n - Clade column in output CSV/TSV will be empty\n\n - Clade column in Nextclade Web will be empty\n\n\nThis change does not affect any other parts of the application. Notably, clade-like attributes (from `.meta.extensions.nextclade.clade_node_attrs`), if present, are still assigned and being written to the output as before.\n\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n### Installation and usage\n\n\ud83d\udcda Documentation: [docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade)\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Nextclade Web: [clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org)\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Nextclade CLI:\n\n- \ud83d\udce5 Standalone native executables can be downloaded using the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

This has been fixed.\n\n#### Select suggested dataset automatically when suggestion is triggered manually\n\nWhen suggestion is triggered manually, using \"Suggest\" button on main page, Nextclade will now automatically select the best dataset as the current dataset. Previously this could only be done by clearing the current dataset first and then clicking \"Suggest\". When suggestion algorithm is triggered automatically, the behavior is unchanged - the dataset will not be selected.\n\n\n### Nextclade CLI\n\n#### Don't read dataset's `tree.json` and `genome_annotation.gff3` unless they are declared\n\nNextclade CLI will no longer read `tree.json` and `genome_annotation.gff3` from the dataset, unless they are declared in the `pathogen.json`. These are optional files and we cannot assume their presence or filenames.\n\n#### Warn user if input dataset contains extra files\n\nNextclade CLI will warn users when input datasets contains extra files which are not declared in the dataset's  pathogen.json, or if there's extra declarations of files in the pathogen.json, but the files are not actually present in the dataset. This is mostly only useful to dataset authors for debugging issues in their datasets.\n\n#### Add Bioconda Linux ARM build\n\nWe added one more build variant to Bioconda distribution channel - for Linux operating system on 64-bit ARM hardware architecture. It uses `nextclade-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` executable underneath. This can be useful if you prefer to manage Nextclade CLI installation on your Linux ARM machine or in a Docker ARM container with Conda package manager. However, because Nextclade CLI is a self-contained single-file executable, we still recommend [direct downloads from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases) rather than Conda or other installation methods.\n\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n### Installation and usage\n\n\ud83d\udcda Documentation: [docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade)\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Nextclade Web: [clades.nextstrain.org](https://clades.nextstrain.org)\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Nextclade CLI:\n\n- \ud83d\udce5 Standalone native executables can be downloaded using the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

The new default output path for translations is `nextclade.cds_translation.{cds}.fasta`. Before v3, the default path was `nextclade_gene_{gene}.translation.fasta`. You can emulate the old (default) behavior by passing `--output-translations=\"nextclade_gene_{cds}.translation.fasta\"` to `nextclade3`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n \ud83d\udce5 Nextclade CLI can be downloaded from the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

Please see [Nextclade v3 migration guide](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/migration-v3.html) ([alternative link](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/blob/master/docs/user/migration-v3.md)) for a detailed description of each breaking change and of possible migration paths.\r\n\r\n1. Nextalign CLI is removed, because Nextclade CLI can now do everything that Nextalign v2 did\r\n2. Potentially different alignment and translation output due to changes in the seed alignment algorithm. Some of the alignment parameters are removed. Default parameters of new parameters might need to be adjusted.\r\n3. Potentially different tree output due to a new tree builder algorithm.\r\n4. Dataset file format and dataset names have changed.\r\n5. Some CLI arguments for individual input files are removed.\r\n6. Some output files are removed\r\n7. Genome annotation CLI argument is renamed\r\n8. URL parameters in Nextclade Web have changed\r\n9. CDS instead of genes\r\n\r\nThe sections below list all changes - breaking and non-breaking. The breaking changes are denoted with word `[BREAKING]`.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter problems during migration, or breaking changes not mentioned in this document, please report it to the developers by [opening a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/issues/new?title=[v3]).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### General changes\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Alignment\r\n\r\nThe seed matching algorithm was rewritten to be more robust and handle sequences with higher diversity. For example, RSV-A can now be aligned against RSV-B.\r\n\r\nParameters `minSeeds`, `seedLength`, `seedSpacing`, `minMatchRate`, `mismatchesAllowed`, `maxIndel` no longer have any effect and are removed.\r\n\r\nNew parameters `kmerLength`, `kmerDistance`, `minMatchLength`, `allowedMismatches`, `windowSize` are added.\r\n\r\nDefault values should work for sequences with a diversity of up to X%. For sequences with higher diversity, the parameters may need to be adjusted.\r\n\r\nFor short sequences, the threshold length to use full-matrix alignment is now determined based on `kmerLength` instead of the removed `seedLength`. The coefficient is adjusted to roughly match the old final value.\r\n\r\n#### Genome annotation\r\n\r\n##### Replace genes with CDSes\r\n\r\nNextclade now treats genes only as containers for CDSes (\"CDS\" is [coding sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region)). CDSes are the main unit of translation and a basis for AA mutations now. A gene can contain multiple CDSes, but they are handled independently.\r\n\r\n##### Handle fragmentation of genetic features\r\n\r\nA CDS can consist of multiple fragments. These fragments are extracted from the full nucleotide genome independently and joined together (in the order provided in the genome annotation) to form the nucleotide sequence of the CDS. The CDS is then translated and the resulting polypeptides are analyzed (mutations are detected etc.). This implementation allows to handle slippage (e.g. _ORF1ab_ in coronaviruses) and splicing (e.g. _tat_ and _rev_ in HIV-1).\r\n\r\n##### Handle circular genomes\r\n\r\nIf genome annotation describes a CDS fragment as circular (wrapping around origin), Nextclade splits it into multiple linear (non-wrapping) fragments. The translation and analysis is then performed as if it was a linear genome.\r\n\r\nNextclade follows the [GFF3 specification](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md#circular-genomes). Please refer to it for how to describe circular features.\r\n\r\n##### Parse regions, genes and CDSes from GFF3 file\r\n\r\nThe GFF3 file parser has been augmented to support all the types of genetic features necessary for Nextclade to operate. There are still feature types which Nextclade ignores. We can consider supporting more types as scientific need arises.\r\n\r\n#### Phylogenetic tree placement\r\n\r\nNextclade v3 now has the ability to phylogenetically resolve relationships between input sequences, where v2 would only attach each query sequence independently to the reference tree. Nextclade v3 thus may produce trees that are different from the trees produced in Nextclade v2.\r\n\r\nPlease read the [Phylogenetic placement](https://docs.nextstrain.org/projects/nextclade/en/stable/user/algorithm/05-phylogenetic-placement.html) section in the documentation for more details.\r\n\r\n#### Don't count mutations to ambiguous nucleotides as reversions\r\n\r\nWe no longer treat mutations to ambiguous nucleotides as reversions, i.e. if the attachment node has a mutation mutated with respect to reference and the query sequence is ambiguous we previously counted this as a reversion. This change only affects \u201cprivate mutation\u201d QC score and the classification of private mutations into \u201creversion substitution\u201d and \u201cunlabeled substitution\u201d.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Changes in Nextclade Web\r\n\r\n#### Dataset autosuggestion\r\n\r\nNextclade Web can now optionally suggest the most appropriate dataset(s) for user-provided input sequences. Drop your sequences and click \"Suggest\" to try out this feature.\r\n\r\n#### Genome annotation widget\r\n\r\nFollowing changes in genome annotation handling, the genome annotations widget in Nextclade Web now shows CDS fragments instead of genes.\r\n\r\n#### CDS selector widget in Nextclade Web\r\n\r\nThe gene selector dropdown in Nextclade Web's results table has been transformed into a more general genetic feature selector. It shows the hierarchy of genetic features if there are nested features. Otherwise, the list is flat, to save screen space. It shows types of each of the genetic feature (gene, CDS or protein) as colorful badges. The menu is searchable, which is useful for mpox and other large viruses with many genes. Only CDSes can be selected currently, but we may extend this in the future to more feature types.\r\n\r\n#### Show ambiguous nucleotides in sequence views\r\n\r\nNucleotide sequence views (in the results table) now also show colored markers for ambiguous nucleotides (non-ACTGN).\r\n\r\n#### Improve website navigation\r\n\r\nThe row of buttons, containing \"Back\", \"Tree\" and other buttons is removed. Instead, different sections of the web application are always accessible via the main navigation bar.\r\n\r\nThe \"Export\" (\"Download\") and \"Settings\" sections are moved to dedicated pages.\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Changed and removed some of the URL parameters\r\n\r\nDue to changes in the dataset format and input files, the URL parameters have the following changes:\r\n\r\n- `input-root-seq` renamed to `input-ref`\r\n- `input-gene-map` renamed to `input-annotation`\r\n- `input-pathogen-json` added\r\n- `input-qc-config` removed\r\n- `input-pcr-primers` removed\r\n- `input-virus-properties` removed\r\n- `dataset-reference` removed\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Removed some redundant output files\r\n\r\nThe `nextclade.errors.csv` and `nextclade.insertions.csv` files are removed and no longer appear in the \"Export\" dialog, nor are they included into the `nextclade.zip` archive of all outputs.\r\n\r\nErrors and insertions are now included in the `nextclade.csv` and `nextclade.tsv` files.\r\n\r\n#### Auspice updated from v2.45.2 to v2.51.0\r\n\r\nThe Auspice tree viewer component is updated from version 2.45.2 to 2.51.0. See the [Auspice releases](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/releases) or [changelog](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/compare/v2.45.2...v2.51.0#diff-06572a96a58dc510037d5efa622f9bec8519bc1beab13c9f251e97e657a9d4ed).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Changes in Nextclade CLI\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Nextalign CLI is removed\r\n\r\nNextalign CLI is no longer provided as a standalone application along with Nextclade CLI v3 because Nextclade now has all the features that distinguished Nextalign. This means there's only one set of command line arguments to remember.\r\nNextclade CLI runs the same algorithms, accepts same the inputs and provides the same outputs as v2 Nextalign, plus some more. For most use-cases, the CLI interface and the input and output files should be the same or very similar.\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Some alignment parameters are removed\r\n\r\nDue to changes in the seed alignment algorithm, the following parameters are no longer used and the corresponding CLI arguments and JSON fields under `alignmentParams` in `pathogen.json` (previously `virus_properties.json`) were removed:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n--seed-length\r\n--seed-spacing\r\n--max-indel\r\n--min-match-rate\r\n--min-seeds\r\n--mismatches-allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following new alignment parameters were added:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n--allowed-mismatches\r\n--kmer-distance\r\n--kmer-length\r\n--min-match-length\r\n--min-seed-cover\r\n--max-alignment-attempts\r\n--max-band-area\r\n--window-size\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Some CLI arguments for individual input files are removed\r\n\r\nDue to changes in the dataset format the following CLI arguments were removed:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n--input-virus-properties\r\n--input-qc-config\r\n--input-pcr-primers\r\n```\r\n\r\nin favor of `--input-pathogen-json`.\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Some CLI arguments for output files are removed\r\n\r\nThe arguments `--output-errors` and `--output-insertions` have been removed. Their information is now included in `--output-csv` and `--output-tsv`.\r\n\r\n#### [BREAKING] Genome annotation CLI argument is renamed\r\n\r\nThe argument `--input-gene-map` renamed to `--input-annotation`. The short form `-m` remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### [Breaking] Translation selection CLI argument is renamed\r\n\r\nThe argument `--genes` is renamed to `--cds-selection`. The short form `-g` remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### Newick tree output\r\n\r\nNextclade can now also export the tree in Newick format via the `--output-tree-nwk` argument.\r\n\r\n#### Optional input files\r\n\r\nMost input files and files inside datasets are now optional. This simplifies dataset creation and maintenance and allows for step-by-step, incremental extension of them.\r\nYou can start only with a reference sequence, which will only allow for alignment and very basic mutation calling in Nextclade, and later you can add more functionality.\r\nOptional input files also enable the removal of Nextalign CLI.\r\n\r\nIf you maintain a custom dataset or want to try creating one - refer to our [Dataset curation guide](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data/blob/master/docs/dataset-curation-guide.md). Community contributed datasets are welcome!\r\n\r\n#### Added flag for disabling the new tree builder\r\n\r\nThe old phylogenetic tree placement behavior can be restored by adding the `--without-greedy-tree-builder` flag.\r\n\r\n#### New arguments in `dataset list` command\r\n\r\nThe new argument `--only-names` allows to print a concise list of dataset names:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnextclade dataset list --only-names\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new argument `--search` allows to search datasets using substring match with dataset name, dataset friendly name, reference name or reference accession:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnextclade dataset list --search=flu\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe argument `--json` allows to output a JSON object instead of the table. You can write it into a file and to postprocess it:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnextclade dataset list --json > \"dataset_list.json\"\r\nnextclade dataset list --json | jq '.[] | select(.path | startswith(\"nextstrain/sars-cov-2\")) | .attributes'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### New subcommand: `sort`\r\n\r\nThe `sort` subcommand takes your sequences in FASTA format and outputs sequences grouped by dataset in the form of a directory tree. Each subdirectory corresponds to a dataset and contains an output FASTA file with only sequences that are detected to be similar to the reference sequence in this dataset.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnextclade sort --output-dir=\"out/sort/\" --output-results-tsv=\"out/sort.tsv\" \"input.fasta\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be useful for splitting FASTA files containing sequences which belong to different pathogens, strains or segments, for example for separating flu HA and NA segments.\r\n\r\n#### New subcommand: `read-annotation`\r\n\r\nThe `read-annotation` subcommand takes a GFF3 file and displays how features are arranged hierarchically as viewed by Nextclade. This is useful for Nextclade developers and dataset creators to verify (and debug) how Nextclade understand genetic features from a particular GFF3 file.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnextclade read-annotation genome_annotation.gff3\r\n```\r\n\r\nType `nextclade read-annotation --help` for description of arguments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Performance improvements\r\n\r\n#### Nextclade web now twice as fast when processing many sequences\r\n\r\nNextclade Web now uses multithreading more effectively. This results in faster processing of large fastas on computers with more than one processor. The speedup is around 2 for 1000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences on a multi-core machine.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Internal changes\r\n\r\n#### Ensure type safety across programming language boundaries\r\n\r\nThe new features caused changes in major internal data structures and made them more complex. We now generate JSON schema and Typescript typings from Rust code. This allows to find mismatches between parts written in different languages, and to avoid bugs related to data types.\r\n\r\n#### Make positions and ranges in different coord spaces type-safe\r\n\r\nThe change in genome annotation handling had significant consequences for coordinate spaces Nextclade is using internally (e.g. alignment space vs reference space, nuc space vs aa space, global nuc space vs nuc space local to a CDS). In order to make coordinate transforms safer, we introduced new `Position` and `Range` types, different for each space. This prevents mixing up coordinates in different spaces.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\n \ud83d\udce5 Nextclade CLI & Nextalign CLI can be downloaded from the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

        "description": "## Nextclade Web 2.14.0, Nextclade CLI 2.14.0 (2023-05-09)\n\n### Algorithm & Datasets: enable masked sites for distance calculation\n\nFor some viruses, genome sequencing is unreliable in specific parts of the genome or some regions should be ignored for other reasons when calculating distances between nodes for the purpose of placing query sequences on the reference tree. These distances are used to find the optimal (smallest distance) placement of the query sequence on the reference tree and sequence errors in these regions can lead to wrong placement.\n\nUntil now, to place query sequences on the reference tree, Nextclade counted all nucleotide differences between query and reference sequence. Moving forward, sequence regions to be ignored for reference tree placement can be defined in datasets' `virus_properties.json`. This is useful for example for SARS-CoV-2, where we will start ignoring the terminal parts of the untranslated regions. Another use case is mpox, where the terminal repeats are intrinsically constrained to be identical. Masking one of the two terminals will avoid double-counting of the same mutations.\n\n[PR #1128](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/pull/1128) adds this feature to Nextclade's algorithm.\n\nMasked ranges are specified in the new field `placementMaskRanges` in datasets' `virus_properties.json`. For example, the terminal 50 nucleotides of SARS-CoV-2 can be ignored for tree placement by adding the following line (positions are 0-based and end-exclusive):\n\n```json\n\"placementMaskRanges\":[{\"begin\":0,\"end\":50},{\"begin\":29850,\"end\":29902}],\n```\n\nThe changes are backwards compatible, if the field does not exist, Nextclade defaults to the old behavior of counting all nucleotide differences.\n\nWe are planning to shortly release a new version of SARS-CoV-2 datasets making use of this feature. Only a small proportion of sequences (<1%)should be affected, however where there are changes they will be a slight improvement in accuracy.\n\n### Avoid stale software and dataset versions in Nextclade Web\n\nIt was widely reported that users with long-persisting browser tabs and also users who don't switch datasets often, sometimes do not receive new Nextclade dataset updates, which meant that these users would not get newly designated lineages and clades lineage assignments.\n\nNextclade Web is a fully client-side, single-page application, which downloads the code and list of datasets once when first opening a tab. When users do not refresh the tab and don't change dataset, the same software and dataset version are used indefinitely. Without periodic page refresh and without periodic fetching of new dataset versions, users can run old code and use old data indefinitely, receiving obsolete or incomplete results.\n\nIn order to mitigate this problem, in this version, we add periodic background version checks in Nextclade Web. Every day or so, Nextclade Web will check whether the currently used version of software is the latest, as well as periodically refresh the list of available datasets and their versions. Whenever a new version of software or of a dataset is available, user will receive an update notification. The update can be accepted or dismissed (until the next version is available). Additionally, one can always obtain the latest code and datasets by doing a simple page reload in the browser (no need to clear the cache).\n\nNextclade is a fast-moving project, where new features and bug fixes are added frequently. We emphasize importance of using the latest versions of both, software and datasets, to receive the most accurate and up-to-date results.\n\n### Sort empty values in the results table in Nextclade Web\n\nNextclade Web previously had a bug, sorting incorrectly when the the column to be sorted by contained empty values. Empty values are now treated as empty strings, fixing this issue.\n\n### Improved citation dialog, website copy and translation in Nextclade Web\n\nThe \"Citation\" modal is now more readable and translated to multiple languages. We also added missing translations for some of the sentences in Nextclade Web. We made the intro text on main page of Nextclade Web more relevant.\n\n### Internal changes\n\n- Prevent duplicated GitHub action runs in pull requests\n- Remove Red Hat 7 from tested Linux distros\n- Fix Debian repositories in CI builds for aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu architecture\n- Update master branch of the fork before making bioconda PR branch\n- Extend dev documentation\n\n\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h3>Commit history</h3> (click to expand)</summary>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n \ud83d\udce5 Nextclade CLI & Nextalign CLI can be downloaded from the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

        "description": "## Nextclade Web 2.13.0, Nextclade CLI 2.13.0 (2023-03-21)\n\n### Attach sequences to a priori most likely node if reference tree contains \"placement_prior\"\n\nUntil now, when there were multiple positions with equal numbers of mismatches between a query sequence and reference tree position, Nextclade always attached the query sequence to the reference tree node with the fewest number of ancestors. Due to the way recombinants are placed in the SARS-CoV-2 reference trees, this meant that in particular partial sequences were often attached to recombinants. With most recombinants being rare, this bias to attach to recombinants was often surprising.\n\nIn this version, we introduce a new [feature](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/pull/1119) that allows to attach sequences to a priori most likely nodes - taking into account which positions on the reference tree are most commonly found in circulation. The information on the prior probability that a particular reference tree node is the best match for a random query sequence is contained in the `placement_prior` reference tree node attribute. This attribute is currently only present in the most recent SARS-CoV-2 reference trees. The calculation can be found in this `nextclade_data_workflows` [pull request](https://github.com/neherlab/nextclade_data_workflows/pull/38).\n\nTo give an example: a partial sequence may have as many mismatches when compared to BA.5 as it has to the recombinant XP. Based on sequences in public databases, we know that BA.5 is much more common than XP. Hence, the query sequence is attached to BA.5. Previously, the query sequence would have been attached to XP, because XP has fewer parent nodes in the reference tree.\n\nThe impact of the feature is biggest for partial and incomplete sequences.\n\n### Add custom phenotype values to the newly placed tree nodes\n\nWhen available in the dataset, the phenotype values (such as `ace2_binding` and `immune_escape`) are written into all output files except Auspice tree JSON. This omission is now fixed, and these values are set as tree node attributes. This allows to see the values and colorings for phenotype values on the tree page, and when loading the output tree JSON file into Auspice.\n\n### Fix length of 3' unsequenced aminoacid ranges in Nextclade Web\n\nNextclade Web was showing right boundary of the unsequenced AA range on the 3' end of peptide sequences incorrectly - the range was longer than expected. The calculations were using length of a gene in nucleotides, where there should be length in codons. This is now fixed.\n\n### Fix incorrect indices in mutation badges \n\nThe mutation badges in various places in Nextclade Web could show position \"0\", even though they are supposed to be 1-based. This was due to a programming mistake, which is now corrected.\n\n### Fix `input-pcr-primers` and `input-virus-properties` URL params in Nextclade Web\n\nThe `input-pcr-primers` and `input-virus-properties` URL params were swapped in the code accidentally, so one was incorrectly setting the other. This is now fixed.\n\n### Ensure translation warnings in CLI\n\nDue to an omission, Nextclade CLI and Nextalign CLI since v2 did not print sequence translation-related warnings to the console. This is now fixed.\n\n### Fix Google Search Console warnings\n\nWe resolved warnings in Google Search Console: added canonical URL meta tag, and added `noindex` tag for non-release deployments. This should improve Nextclade appearance in Google Search.\n\n### Internal changes:\n\n - freeze wasm-pack version to 0.10.3\n\n\n\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h3>Commit history</h3> (click to expand)</summary>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n \ud83d\udce5 Nextclade CLI & Nextalign CLI can be downloaded from the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

        "description": "## Nextclade Web 2.12.0, Nextclade CLI 2.12.0 (2023-02-28)\n\n### Improve tooltip for \"missing\" column in Nextclade Web\n\nThis column's tooltip now also shows ranges of unsequenced regions, i.e. contiguous ranges of nucleotide characters absent at the 5' and 3' end of the original query sequence, as compared to the reference sequence. To put it differently, these are the ranges that are to the left and right of the alignment range - from 0 to `alignmentStart` and from `alignmentEnd` to the length of the reference sequence. These regions may appear after alignment step, where Nextclade or Nextalign might insert characters `-` on the 5' and 3' ends to fill the query sequence to the length of the reference sequence. Just like it does with the characters that are absent from the inner parts of the query sequence (which we then call \"deletions\"). If found, the unsequenced regions are also shown as two light-grey rectangles at either or both ends of the sequence in sequence view column in Nextclade Web.\n\nUnsequenced regions are not to be confused with the missing nucleotides, which are also shown in the same tooltip. Missing nucleotides are the `N` characters present in the original query sequence. They are not introduced nor modified by Nextclade and Nextalign, and are only detected and counted.\n\nIt seems that there is no consensus in the bioinformatics community about the notation and naming of either of these events (e.g. which character to use and how to call these ranges). Be thoughtful about these regions when working with the results of Nextclade and Nextalign, especially if you analyze:\n\n - sequences from different sources (different labs may use different conventions)\n - sequences that are partial (have large unsequenced ranges on 5' and 3' end and large deletions in the body)\n - sequences of low quality (e.g. lots of `N`s and large deletions in the body)\n - sequences that are already aligned (e.g. have some form of padding on 5' and 3' ends)\n - sequences that are processed in some way (e.g. replacement or filling with `N` or `-`, or even filling from a consensus genome)\n\nIf you find strange or inconsistent results, we encourage you to inspect the input and output sequences in an alignment viewer on per-sequence basis and to contact the authors of individual sequences to clarify their conventions and intent.\n\n### Fix alignment range in CSV and TSV outputs\n\nIn CSV and TSV outputs, the values in columns `alignmentStart` and `alignmentEnd` were emitted in 0-based numbering. This was unexpected - by convention, CSV and TSV files have all ranges in 1-based format. This is now fixed.\n\n### Add new columns in CSV and TSV outputs\n\nWe added new columns in CSV and TSV outputs:\n\n - `unknownAaRanges` - list of detected contiguous ranges of unknown aminoacid (character `X`)\n - `totalUnknownAa` - total number of unknown aminoacids (character `X`)\n\n### Internal changes\n\n - Upgrade Auspice to 2.43.0 ([changelog](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md))\n - Upgrade Rust to 1.67.1 ([changelog](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md))\n\n\n\n---\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h3>Commit history</h3> (click to expand)</summary>\n</details>\n\n---\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n \ud83d\udce5 Nextclade CLI & Nextalign CLI can be downloaded from the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

However, for analyses which ended up with an error (e.g. \"Unable to align\") this column was mistakenly missing. In this version we fix this omission.\n\n### Fix gene map width in Nextclade Web\n\nGene map (genome annotation) was misaligned with sequence views (not matching their width). This has been fixed in this version.\n\n### Add table row indices to results table in Nextclade Web\n\nWe added a column with index of the row in the table. This is useful for visual search and counting of sorted and filtered results.\n\nNot to be confused with sequence index. Row indices always start with 0 and sorted in ascending order, and do not change their position when sorting or filtering the results.\n\nThese indices are not a part of output files.

We changed the layout such that the panel with buttons does not overflow along with table and so the buttons are always visible. Table is still scrollable.\n\n### Improve wording on main page of Nextclade Web\n\nWe improved text on main page as well as descriptions inside HTML markup, adding more concrete information and keywords.

        "description": "## Nextclade Web 2.10.0, Nextclade CLI 2.10.0 (2023-01-24)\r\n\r\n### Add motifs search\r\n\r\nNextclade datasets can now be configured to search for motifs in the translated sequences, given a regular expression.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we released new versions of the following Influenza datasets, which use this feature to detect glycosylation motifs:\r\n\r\n - Influenza A H1N1pdm HA (flu_h1n1pdm_ha), with reference MW626062\r\n - Influenza A H3N2 HA (flu_h3n2_ha), with reference EPI1857216\r\n\r\nIf you run the analysis with the latest version of these datasets, you can find the results in the `glycosylaiton` column or field of output files or in \"Glyc.\" column in Nextclade Web.\r\n\r\nIf you want to configure your own datasets for motifs search, see an example configuration in the `aaMotifs` property of `virus_properties.json` of these datasets: [link](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade_data/blob/bc2974ab3bf5a9198e68f5f54db095dc3d6e968b/data/datasets/flu_h3n2_ha/references/EPI1857216/versions/2023-01-19T12%3A00%3A00Z/files/virus_properties.json#L35-L55).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Allow to chose columns written into CSV and TSV outputs\r\n\r\nYou can now select a subset of columns to be included into CSV and TSV output files of Nextclade Web (available in the \"Download\" dialog) and Nextclade CLI (available with `--output-csv` and `--output-tsv`). You can either chose individual columns or categories of related columns.\r\n\r\nIn Nextclade Web, in the \"Download\" dialog, click \"Configure columns\", then check or uncheck columns or categories you want to keep. Note that this configuration persists across different Nextclade runs.\r\n\r\nIn Nextclade CLI, use `--output-columns-selection` flag. This flag accepts a comma-separated list of column names and/or column category names. Individual columns and categories can be mixed together. You can find a list of column names in the full output file. The following categories are currently available: all, general, ref-muts, priv-muts, errs-warns, qc, primers, dynamic. Another way to receive both lists is to add a non-existent or misspelled name to the list. The error message will then display all possible columns and categories.\r\n\r\nNote that because of this feature the order of columns might be different compared to previous versions of Nextclade.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Add URL parameter for running analysis of example sequences\r\n\r\nYou can now launch the analysis of example sequences (as provided by the dataset) in Nextclade Web, by using the special keyword `example` in the `input-fasta` URL parameter. For example, navigating to this URL will run the analysis of example SARS-CoV-2 sequences (same as choosing \"SARS-CoV-2\" and then clicking \"Load example\" in the UI):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://clades.nextstrain.org/?dataset-name=sars-cov-2&input-fasta=example\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could useful for example for testing new datasets:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://clades.nextstrain.org/?dataset-url=http://example.com/my-dataset-dir&input-fasta=example\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Add `index` column to CSV and TSV outputs\r\n\r\nThe `index` field is already present in other output formats. In this version CSV and TSV output files gain `index` column as well, which contains the index (integer signifying location) of a corresponding record in the input fasta file or files. Note that this is not the same as row index, because CSV/TSV rows can be emitted in an unspecified order in Nextclade CLI (but this can be changed with `--in-order` flag; which is set by default in Nextclade Web).\r\n\r\nNote that sequence names (`seqName` column) are not guaranteed to be unique (and in practice are not unique very often). So indices is the only way to reliably link together inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "## Nextclade Web 2.9.1, Nextclade CLI 2.9.1 (2022-12-09)\n\n### Set default weights in \"private mutations\" QC check to 1\n\nThis fixes the bug when the QC score is 0 (good) when the following QC fields are missing from `qc.json`:\n\n```\n.privateMutations.weightLabeledSubstitutions\n.privateMutations.weightReversionSubstitutions\n.privateMutations.weightUnlabeledSubstitutions\n```\n\nIn this case Nextclade assumed value of 0, which lead to QC score of 0 always. Not all datasets were adjusted for the new `qc.json` format in time and some had these fields missing - notably the flu datasets. So these datasets were erroneously showing perfect QC score for the \"private mutations\" rule. \n\nIn this version we set these weights to 1.0 if they are missing, which fixes the incorrect QC scores. Some of the sequences will now correctly show worse QC scores.\n\n\n### Fix dataset selector in Nextclade Web when there are datasets with the same name, but different reference sequences\n\nThe dataset selector on the main page on nextclade Web did not allow selecting datasets with the same name, but different reference sequences. This did not affect users so far, but we are about to release new Influenza datasets, which were affected. In this version we resolve the problem by keeping track of datasets not just by name, but by a combination of all attribute values (the `.attributes[]` entries in the datasets index JSON file).\n\n\n### Ensure non-default references in \"dataset list\" command of Nextclade CLI are shown\n\nThis introduces special value `all` for `--reference` argument of `nextclade dataset list` command. And it is now set as default. When it's in force, datasets with all reference sequences are included into the displayed list. This resolves the problem where non-default references are not show in the list.\n\n\n### Internal changes\n\n - We are now submitting PRs to bioconda automatically, which should reduce the delay of updates there\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h3>Commit history</h3> (click to expand)</summary>\n</details>\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\n \ud83d\udce5 Nextclade CLI & Nextalign CLI can be downloaded from the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.

        "description": "## Nextclade Web 2.9.0, Nextclade CLI 2.9.0 (2022-12-06)\n\n### Increase requirements for supported Linux distributions for GNU flavor of Nextclade CLI\n\nDue to malfunction of package repositories of Debian 7, we had to switch automated builds of the \"gnu\" flavor of Nextclade CLI from Debian 7 to CentOS 7. This increases minimum required version of glibc to 2.17. The list or Linux distributions we tested the new version of Nextclade on is [here](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/blob/9f2b9a620a7bc9a068909634a4fc3f29757c059f/tests/test-linux-distros#L18-L62). For users of older Linux distributions (with glibc < 2.17) we suggest to use \"musl\" flavor of Nextclade CLI, which does not depend on glibc, but might be substantially slower. Users of Nextclade CLI on macOS and Windows and users of Nextclade Web are not affected.\n\n### Add gene length validation in GFF3 parser\n\nNextclade will now check if genes have length divisible by 3 in gene maps and will fail with an error if it's not the case.\n\n### Fix translated (internationalized) strings in Nextclade Web\n\nWe fixed missing spaces between words in some of the languages and fixes some of the translations.\n\n### Internal changes\n\n - build Linux binaries on CentOS 7\n - migrate CI to GitHub Actions\n - upgrade Rust to 1.65.0\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary><h3>Commit history</h3> (click to expand)</summary>\n</details>\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\n \ud83d\udce5 Nextclade CLI & Nextalign CLI can be downloaded from the links in the \"Assets\" section just below.
