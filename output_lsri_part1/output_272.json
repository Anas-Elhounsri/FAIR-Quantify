The old name (`predict_taxonomy`) is kept as a\r\n  deprecated alias.\r\n- Similarly, sequence features (_k_-mer and abundance) are generated using the commands `generate_sequence_features_single` and\r\n  `generate_sequence_features_multi` (for single- and multi-sample modes, respectively). The old names generate_data_single`/`generate_data_multi`) are kept as deprecated aliases.\r\n- Add `check_install` command and run `check_install` before easy command\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n- Fix bug with non-standard characters in sample names (#68).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @SvetlanaUP made their first contribution in https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/pull/60\r\n",

Previously, only contigs greater\r\n  than the given minimal length were used (instead of greater-equal to the\r\n  minimal length).\r\n- GTDB downloading was inconsistent in a few instances which have been fixed\r\n\r\n### Internal improvements\r\n- Much more efficient code (including lower memory usage) for binning,\r\n  especially if a pretrained model is used. As an example, using a\r\n  deeply-sequenced ocean sample, generating the data (`generate_data_single`\r\n  step) goes down from 14 to 9 minutes; while binning (`bin` step, using\r\n  `--recluster`) goes down from 10m17s (using 20GB of RAM, at peak) to 4m33\r\n  (using 4.5 GB, at peak). Thus total time from BAM file to bins went down from\r\n  25 to 14 minutes (using 4 threads) and peak RAM is now 4.5GB, making it\r\n  usable on a typical laptop.\r\n",
