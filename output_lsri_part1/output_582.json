Recently, advancements in long read sequencing have yielded unprecedented information about the usage and abundance of these RNA isoforms. However, visualization of long-read sequencing data remains challenging due to the high information density. To alleviate these issues we have developed NanoBlot, an open-source, R-package, which generates northern blot and RT-PCR-like images from long-read sequencing data. NanoBlot requires aligned, positionally sorted and indexed BAM files. Plotting is based around ggplot2 and is easily customizable. Advantages of nanoblots include: A robust system for designing probes to visualize isoforms including excluding reads based on the presence or absence of a specified region, an elegent solution to representing isoforms with continuous variations in length, and the ability to overlay multiple genes in the same plot using different colors. We present examples of nanoblots compared to actual northern blot data. In addition to traditional gel-like images, the NanoBlot package can also output other visualizations such as violin plots and 3\u2032-RACE-like plots focused on 3\u2032-ends isoforms visualization. The use of the NanoBlot package should provide a simple answer to some of the challenges of visualizing long-read RNA sequencing data.   \n"

Because we are not concerned with gene comparisons within samples, the only other normalization method that allows for differential expression analysis of genes between samples is DESeq2\u2019s median of ratios.

Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4783481\n \nDepending on the user's intended usage of NanoBlot, the user can either run normalization using one technical replicate or multiple replicates for normalization. The standard workflow includes running one technical replicate with a n=1, and skips the estimation of dispersion and negative bionomial wald test, and instead only uses an estimation of size factors which we call in the script as BASH17*[^2]. This size factor produces an appropriate normalization factor for each sequencing sample.   \n[^2]: Anders, S., Huber, W. Differential expression analysis for sequence count data. Genome Biol 11, R106 (2010). https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106\n \nThere are many ways to run DESeq2. For NanoBlot, we will be first generating count tables through the Rsubread R package, which is used for mapping, quantification, and variant analysis of sequencing data. [^3] In the backend, the function BASH18* will call the helper function BASH19* which takes as input an annotation file as well as the unnormalized files to calculate the normalization based on the entire sequencing library as opposed to a subset of it. The annotation file should be in the gtf format supplied using the **Ensembl** [^4] database.  \n[^3]: Liao Y, Smyth GK, Shi W (2019). \u201cThe R package Rsubread is easier, faster, cheaper and better for alignment and quantification of RNA sequencing reads.\u201d Nucleic Acids Research, 47, e47. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkz114.\n[^4]: Ensembl 2022. Nucleic Acids Res. 2022, vol. 50(1):D988-D995 PubMed PMID: 34791404. doi:10.1093/nar/gkab1049\n \nThese count tables will then be used by DESeq2\u2019s **estimateSizeFactors()** method [^2], with the size factors printed to the console. Should the user choose to normalize technical replicates of more than 1 using DESeq2, there is an optional argument to BASH20* which takes a coldata argument, which will be passed into DESeq2's command BASH21*. The user should read the documentation for DESeq2 for more information on how to specify the coldata argument.  \n"

We understand this is an imperfect method as CPM should not be used for differential expression analysis and should be proceeded with caution.

It utilizes the same viewingWindow argument input to specify the genomic window of the RACE experiment. The only difference between RACE and RT-PCR is that whereas RT-PCR checks for inclusive ends on BOTH sides of the viewing window, RACE only checks for inclusive ends on ONE side of the viewing window, the 5' end of the specified window. Conceptually, this makes sense as the RACE protocol is used to determine regions of unknown sequences. For example, a 3' RACE experiment to determine unknown 3' mRNA sequences that lie between the exon and the poly(A) tail uses a gene-specific primer that anneals to a region of known exon sequences and an adapter primer that targets the poly(A) tail. [^7]  For more information on usage, read 3' RACE protocols to see what you need. Reference manuscript for example usage.  \n\n[^7]: \u201c3\u00b4 RACE System for Rapid Amplification of CDNA Ends.\u201d Thermo Fisher Scientific - US, https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/protocols/nucleic-acid-amplification-and-expression-profiling/cdna-protocol/3-race-system-for-rapid-amplification-of-cdna-ends.html.  \n### Checking Sample Integrity \nAn additional method we provide is for users to check a psuedo measure of their sample integrity based off of long-read sequencing data alone. This serves as a proxy to a measure like a RIN score analysis. The function ```checkIntegrity``` takes two arguments, one which is a GRanges object from the Genomic Ranges class which contains all the expected full length features, and a BamFileList object from the Rsamtools package which contains all the original non subsetted bam files.  \nThe integrity function then goes through each individual feature in the GeneTargets argument and calculates the percentage of full length reads over total reads that map to that given feature. For a short diagram of this overlap, please reference the paper. The function then outputs a cumulative distribitution plot that visualizes each sample's overall percetange of intact full length reads. A sample graph of this output is pictured down below.  \nBecause NanoBlot deals with discrete read representations instead of continuous count numbers, the best way to visually represent the normalization is to duplicate the existing number of reads by a certain number that we call the duplication factor. This number is first calculated by taking the inverse of the size factor, since the size factor is divided during DESeq2\u2019s count normalization, and then multiplying the inversed number by 10 and rounding to the nearest digit to account for minimal data loss. Although this duplication factor would scale each sample respectively to their normalized counts, certain samples that inherently have lower reads than others would be visually hard to see. We then assigned an arbitrary **DUPLICATION_CONSTANT** a value of 2000 in order to scale all samples up or down respectively to ensure equal plotting exposure. This is essentially like automatically determining the exposure for northern blots. The duplication factor from the previous step is then multiplied by taking the **DUPLICATION_CONSTANT** divided by the max number of reads across all samples plotted and rounded to the nearest integer. The plotting script then takes each sample\u2019s reads and upscales it n times according to the duplication factor. \n \n"
