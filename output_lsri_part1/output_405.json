This repository provides source code for 5 different experiments in different folders.\r\nThe folder `ordering` contains code for generating an A/B/C order and computing the similarity of neighboring strings in an order. \r\n`hashcollision` contains code for computing the probability of hash collision of different methods.\r\n`pariwisealignment` has code for using SubseqHash in pairwise sequence alignment. `readmaping` has code for mapping reads to reference genome with SubseqHash.\r\n`overlap-detection` provides code for comparing SubseqHash with minimizer on the seeding step of overlap detection.\r\n\r"
