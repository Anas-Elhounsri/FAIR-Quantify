You can directly use results from Sage without needing to use other tools for these tasks.\n\nAdditionally, Sage was designed with cloud computing in mind - massively parallel processing and the ability to directly stream compressed mass spectrometry data to/from AWS S3 enables unprecedented search speeds with minimal cost. \n\n Sage also runs just as well reading local files from your Mac/PC/Linux device!\n"

This is compatible with the `--parquet` CLI option as well. Annotations will be written to `matched_fragments.sage.tsv` or `matched_fragments.sage.parquet`. by @grosenberger-bruker in https://github.com/lazear/sage/pull/101\r\n- Sage sends basic telemetry data (version of Sage, run time, OS, # of CPU cores, # of peptides in database, whether LFQ is used) to a remote database. No information about your actual data is sent - e.g. identifications, quantities, organism, or modifications, etc are NOT tracked or reported.  This data will be used to help focus efforts on improving Sage and figuring which features are most used. Please take a look at `crates/sage-cli/src/telemetry.rs` to see exactly what is sent! You can disable sending telemetry data  by using the `--disable-telemetry-i-dont-want-to-improve-sage` CLI flag.\r\n### Changed\r\n- Modified visibility on some crate internals to support the [sagepy project](https://github.com/theGreatHerrLebert/sagepy) by @theGreatHerrLebert in https://github.com/lazear/sage/pull/103\r\n- Added `psm_id` field to various output files to match the new `--annotate-matches` option.\r\n### Removed\r\n- Removed the `ms1_intensity` field from CSV output, since it is essentially useless\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @FriedLabJHU made their first contribution in https://github.com/lazear/sage/pull/94\r\n* @theGreatHerrLebert made their first contribution in https://github.com/lazear/sage/pull/103\r\n* @grosenberger-bruker made their first contribution in https://github.com/lazear/sage/pull/101\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/lazear/sage/compare/v0.14.4...v0.14.5\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n**This is the biggest release yet - major overhaul to LFQ, changes to chimeric searching!**\r\n_Please note that there are some breaking changes to the `quant` section of the configuration file format_\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the changelog below (and in CHANGELOG.md) are not completely comprehensive, please open an issue if you discover something.\r\n\r\nLFQ actually works pretty well now: \ud83c\udfaf \ud83d\ude80\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14057244/231943001-4b96566f-2666-425c-bd6d-8e3c813202b5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Support for percolator output files (`--write-pin` CLI flag)\r\n- Support for modifying file batch size (`--batch-size N` CLI flag)\r\n- Add `delta_best` feature, which reports the delta hyperscore from the best match to current ranked PSM\r\n- Add Sage version to `results.json` files\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Rename \"file\" to \"filename\" in quant.tsv by @lgatto in https://github.com/lazear/sage/pull/57\r\n- Breaking changes to `quant` section of the configuration file format\r\n- Rename `delta_hyperscore` to `delta_next`\r\n- Altered internal scoring algorithm. Rather than consider all MS2 peaks within a m/z tolerance window to be matches to a theoretical spectrum, consider only the closest peak. This should increase the accuracy of # of matched peaks, and subsequent scores\r\n- Overhaul of chimeric scoring, `report_psms` can now be used to search for multiple chimeric spectra\r\n- Completely overhauled the LFQ algorithm: added match-between runs, peak scoring using normalized spectral angle relative to theoretical isotopic envelope, target decoy scoring of MS1 integration\r\n- Fixed bug in picked-peptide FDR that could lead to liberal FDR\r\n- Fixed bug in picked-protein FDR that could lead to conservative FDR\r\n- Fixed bug where using variable protein terminal (e.g. protein N-terminal acetylation) modifications could cause some determinism. This also improves the accuracy of peptide => protein assignment. Unfortunately this fix has performance implications, causing creation of the fragment index to take up to ~2x as long.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- Remove `no-parallel` CLI flag, and `parallel` configuration file entry\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/lazear/sage/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0",
