        "value": "Identifying the functions of known proteins is an important task in understanding their critical roles in biological processes. Although high throughput sequencing tools seem to make this task easier, experimental function identification techniques cannot keep up with the increasing amount of sequence data due to their expensive and time-consuming nature. Continuously expanding output of the high throughput sequencing tools is stored in public databases such as the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and the majority of it (currently ~%99, November 2021) is not experimentally annotated yet.  \n<br/>\nHere, we propose a new method called Domain2GO with the aim of identifying unknown protein functions by associating domains with Gene Ontology terms, thus defining the problem as domain function prediction. Domain2GO mappings are generated using the existing domain and GO annotation data. In order to obtain highly reliable associations, we employed statistical resampling and analyzed the co-occurrence patterns of domains and GO terms on the same proteins. Furthermore, three different association probability measures were calculated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and an ablation study was performed to compare the predictive performance of the different versions of the proposed method. As a use-case study, examples selected from the finalized mappings are examined via literature review, to assess their biological relevance. We then applied the proposed method to predict protein functions, by propagating domain-associated GO terms to proteins that are annotated with those domains. For protein function prediction performance evaluation and comparison against other methods, we employed CAFA3 challenge datasets. The results demonstrated the potential of Domain2GO, especially when predicting molecular function and biological process terms, as it performed better than baseline predictors and curated associations (Fmax = 0.48 and 0.36 for MFO and BPO, respectively). The approach proposed here can be extended to other ontologies, biological entities, and their features to explore unknown relationships in complex and large-scale biological data.  \n<br/>\nThe study is summarized in the schematic workflow below. \n\n| ![alt text for screen readers](/figures/full_methodology.png \"Schematic workflow of the Domain2GO\") | \n|:--:| \n| **Schematic representation of the proposed method. (A)** The source datasets were downloaded and organized; **(B)** initial mapping between the InterPro domains and GO terms were obtained, and the mapping parameters were calculated; **(C)** generation of the randomized annotation and mapping sets were constructed; **(D)** co-occurrence similarity distributions were plotted, and thresholds were selected based on statistical resampling; **(E)** an ablation study was conducted by calculating the enrichment of top predictions ranked by different statistical measures and finalized Domain2GO mappings were generated by filtering initial mappings; **(F)** protein function predictions were generated by propagating Domain2GO mappings to target proteins. |\n<br/> \n"
