        "description": "## What's Changed\r\n* Improve performance by removing regex from indel location analysis by @Colelyman https://github.com/pinellolab/CRISPResso2/pull/182\r\n* Fastq output produced by `--fastq_output` now includes the inserted bases. Previously, a string like \"DEL= INS=78(1) SUB= \" would indicate a 1bp insertion at site 78. This update outputs strings like \"DEL= INS=78(1+G) SUB= \" with the insertion described as a plus character followed by the inserted bases. (2f84dd02787abffa6d39efbc50c82c92d1c87528)\r\n* Adds features for providing aligned bams as input to CRISPRessoPooled and for a faster demultiplexing when amplicons and genome are provided. The added parameters are: \r\n  * `--aligned_pooled_bam`: Path to aligned input for CRISPRessoPooled processing. If this parameter is specified, the alignments in the given bam will be used to demultiplex reads. If this parameter is not set (default), input reads provided by `--fastq_r1` (and optionally `--fastq_r2`) will be aligned to the reference genome using bowtie2. If the input bam is given, the corresponding reference fasta must also be given to extract reference genomic sequences via the parameter `--bowtie2_index`. Note that the aligned reads are paired-end seqenced, they should already be merged into 1 read (e.g. via Flash) before alignment.\r\n  * `--demultiplex_only_at_amplicons`: If set, and an amplicon file (`--amplicons_file`) and reference sequence (`--bowtie2_index`) are provided, reads overlapping alignment positions of amplicons will be demultiplexed and assigned to that amplicon. If this flag is not set, the entire genome will be demultiplexed and reads with the same start and stop coordinates as an amplicon will be assigned to that amplicon.\r\n\r\nMinor bug fixes: \r\n  * Fix deprecated pandas indexers (eea442a763e0c6c41da16a15d6e11ddf6d222dc8, f4b6cfc03951215c3b9019dc47beb2913a5448ab) \r\n  * Update ylabel_values -> y_label_values by @swrosati in https://github.com/pinellolab/CRISPResso2/pull/174\r\n  * Allow mixed-case prime-editing input (e9990790a0081b765c1f54f4a9b18db522ab4693)\r\n  * Fix int bug for CRISPRessoPooled n_reads (ef15caee29380f58aaae392c897fabe47587486e)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pinellolab/CRISPResso2/compare/v2.2.6...v2.2.7",

Unfortunately, sqrt(n) isn't a really useful number for the number of processes people usually run (e.g. 2 or 3 or even 8), and a lot of the CRISPResso processing isn't enabled to take advantage of multiprocessing (e.g. the alignment step), so processes were being wasted. So we reverted back to having n_processes CRISPResso processes, each with 1 process.  (a923a7c)\r\n- Remove version checks for numpy and seaborn (90b43ea)\r\n- Fix allele plotting error for plot 5 referring to uninitialized y_max variable (53197e6)\r\n- Fix unicode errors for bam read/write (8196b6a)\r\n- Convert columns in nucleotide count and modification tables to numeric for PE analysis (cabebbe)\r\n- Make loggers module-specific so matplotlib debug doesn't get spewn out in the CRISPResso log (c2bdd96) \r\n- Add unit tests (3e6c281)\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/pinellolab/CRISPResso2/compare/v2.2.5...v2.2.6",

The legacy parameters were somewhat strict. The new parameters reflect the 'default_min_aln_score' parameter in allowing for substantially more indels and mismatches than previous.\r\nThe parameter `--use_legacy_bowtie2_options_string` has been added to use the legacy settings. Otherwise, the bowtie2 alignment settings will be calculated as follows:\r\n--end-to-end - no clipping, match bonus -ma is set to 0\r\n-N 0 number of mismatches allowed in seed alignment\r\n--np 0 where read (or ref have ambiguous character (N)) penalty is 0\r\n--mp 3,2 mismatch penalty - set max mismatch to -3 to coincide with the gap extension penalty (2 is the default min mismatch penalty)\r\n--score-min L,-5,-3*(1-H) For a given homology score, we allow up to (1-H) mismatches (-3) or gap extensions (-3) and one gap open (-5).

Note that the alignment details (location, cigar string, etc) are not modified.. this may be done in the future). Bam file input cannot be trimmed or pre-processed with quality filtering.\r\n\r\n- Prime editing scaffold incorporation is now more accurate (looks for the scaffold sequence at the expected position directly after the extension sequence). A plot showing the number of bases matching the scaffold, as well as insertions after the extension sequence, and a data file with these numbers is produced. Added parameter `--prime_editing_pegRNA_scaffold_min_match_length` to define the minimum length required to classify a read as 'Scaffold-incorporated'\r\n\r\n- Renamed split_paired_end parameter to `--split_interleaved_input` for interleaved input\r\n\r\n- Auto mode now considers 5000 reads to detect amplicon sequences\r\n\r\n- Add new paramter `--annotate_wildtype_allele` to annotate wildtype alleles on the allele plots\r\n\r\n- Update output when reporting missing files -- only lists first 15 files in the current directory and directory of input parameter\r\n\r\n--reference https instead of http",
