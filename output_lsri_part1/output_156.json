        "value": "scDrugPrio presents a framework for drug prioritisation and repositioning in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) based on scRNA-seq based, multicellular disease models (MCDMs) that incorporate key biological and pharmacological properties. Using scRNA-seq-derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of either 1) one individual or 2) a group comparison between patients and controls, scDrugPrio starts by identifying cell type-specific drug candidates by considering both proximity in a protein\u2012protein interaction network and biopharmacological criteria. To rank drug candidates, scDrugPrio calculates two measures, intracellular and extracellular centrality. We used these two measures to capture two important drug properties, namely, 1) proficiency in targeting key disease-associated expression changes in a cell type and 2) the relative importance of the targeted cell type. These measures are then aggregated over all cell types to provide a final drug ranking.\nBecause of the complexity and heterogeneity of IMIDs, we started by developing scDrugPrio using scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis. This reduced heterogeneity since the mice are inbred and the disease induced in a standardised way. Moreover, the mouse model allowed extensive *in vitro* and *in vivo* validation studies. Results were even validated in human *in vitro* experiments. Furthermore, we applied scDrugPrio to human Crohn\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriatic arthritis and achieve high prediction precision for known drug-disease pairs. Individual drug predictions on Crohn\u2019s disease patients revealed that scDrugPrio was able to distinguish individual Crohn\u2019s patients that did or did not respond to anti-TNF treatment. \n\nIn the underlying [publication](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-024-01314-7) we exemplify the following case-of-use scenarios for scDrugPrio:\n-\tDrug repurposing predictions\n-\tDrug prioritisation for pooled patient data\n-\tDrug prioritisation for individual patient data\n-\tIn a clinical trial setting in which two treatments are being compared, scDrugPrio might be used for retrospective prediction of which patients responded to treatments. Since scDrugPrio includes several relevant biological models of disease, this holds the potential to gain a better pathophysiological understanding of the patient at hand.\n\nAdditionally, it is imaginable that scDrugPrio might be used in a basket clinical trial with a finite set of possible treatments, for prospective assignment of patients to treatments, or for other drug related research questions.\n\n"
