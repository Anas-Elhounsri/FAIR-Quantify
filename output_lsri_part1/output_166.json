        "value": "The list of annotation (or base) species describes the attributes of each unit that serves as a building block for a molecular species. For example, in a simple dimer reaction system where molecules ```A + B -> AB```, molecules BASH2* and BASH3* are comprised of a single unit of species BASH2* and BASH3* respectively. BASH4* is a molecule that is formed by one unit of BASH2* and one unit of BASH3*. This section describes the properties of these units, including their species type (discrete particle vs bulk molecule), diffusion constant, displayed color, a list of valid spatial compartments, and optional modification sites and binding sites. \nThere are two ways to model molecules in Cell4D: they can be simulated as discrete dimensionless point particles, or as local concentrations of molecules within a c-voxel. The particle approach should be used for most cases, as it is the most fine-grain method to simulate molecules and their interactions with one another. However, for molecules that are particularly high in concentration, such as ions, it would be more efficient to simulate them as local concentrations using the \"bulk molecule\" approach, which reduces the number of computations required to simulate the diffusion and reactions of that molecule type. \nSpecies binding sites are additional optional parameters for the species definition. each site consists of a binding site name and optional binding state parameters \nSites with no site states will be considered \"binding sites\" with two possible states: ```bound``` and BASH6*. These are flags indicating if a site is in use for molecule complexes with multiple species bound together.  \nSite states can also be filled with multiple BASH7*, which indicate the modification state of the species. For example, a species that can be phosphorylated can have the BASH8* and BASH9* site states, representing the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states respectively. Binding sites can have as many sites as the user would like, but it is recommended that modification sites have at least 2 states.  \n \n"

Interaction reactions can be set to reversible, which will require an additional reaction rate input. \nThe units of the reaction rate constant depends on the number of reactants.
