Many methods have been proposed to classify viruses, some of\nwhich are designed for a specific family of organisms and some of which are more general. But still,\nespecially for certain categories such as Influenza and HIV, classification is facing performance\nchallenges as well as processing and memory bottlenecks. In this way, we designed an automated\nclassifier, called PC-mer, that is based on k-mer and physicochemical characteristics of nucleotides,\nwhich reduces the number of features about 2 k times compared to the alternative methods based on k-mer,\nand compared to integer and one-hot encoding methods, it is possible to keep the number of features\nconstant despite the growth of the sequence length. In this way, it also increases the training speed by an\naverage of 88%. This improvement in processing complexity is provided while PC-mer can also improve\nthe classifying performance for a variety of virus families.</p>\n"

        "value": "It is worth mentioning that PC-mer encoding allows usage of larger k-mers by reducing the size of encoded data. Specifically, PC-mer encoding is designed to reduce the computational overhead of k-mers, as well as the volume of the generated data from O(4^k) to O(3\u00d72^k). For example, assuming k=7 in the FCGR method, a vector of size 16,384 is generated for each genome sequence, while PC-mer encoding generates a vector of size 12,288 for each genomic sequence, assuming k=12, which is much smaller than that of the FCGR\u2019s generated data for k=7. It should be mentioned that assuming k-mers of size 12 in the FCGR method leads to a vector of size 16,777,216 per genome sequence. As a key superiority, PC-mer encoding with k = 7 (that produces vectors of size 384 for each genome sequence) achieves equal or higher accuracy, compared to the MLDSP tool with k-mers of size 12. We can conclude that the data compression achieved by the PC-mer encoding not only increases the classification accuracy and the feasibility of using larger k-mers, but also it leads to significant reduction in preprocessing, training, and testing times.\nMemory Consumption (PC-mer VS.
