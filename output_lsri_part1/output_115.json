If you have a feature or improvement you'd like to add, here's how you can initiate a pull request on GitHub: \n1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the sRNAfrag repository to your own GitHub account. \n3. **Develop Your Feature**:\n   - **New Python File**: Develop your feature in a new Python file. Ensure that the code is well-commented and adheres to the project's coding standards.\n   - **README for Your Feature**: Create a README file specifically for your feature. This README should include:\n     - The purpose of the feature.\n     - Any new packages or dependencies required for your feature.\n     - An example command or usage guide demonstrating how to use the feature. \n4. **Test Your Code**: Before submitting a pull request, thoroughly test your code to ensure it works as expected and does not introduce any new bugs. \n5. **Update Documentation**: If your feature adds new functionality, update the main `README.md` or the wiki to reflect this change. \n6. **Create a Pull Request**:\n   - Commit your changes to your branch and push them to your forked repository.\n   - Navigate to the original sRNAfrag repository on GitHub.\n   - Click on the 'Pull Requests' tab and then the 'New Pull Request' button.\n   - Choose your fork and branch, and then submit the pull request. \n7. **Code Review**:\n   - Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by the repository maintainers.\n   - Engage in the review process, addressing any feedback or changes requested by the maintainers. \n"
