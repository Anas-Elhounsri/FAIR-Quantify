        "value": "The objective of [MMD-MA](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34632462/) is to\nmatch points coming from two different spaces in a lower dimensional space. To\nthis end, two sets of points are projected, from two different spaces endowed\nwith a positive definite kernel, to a shared Euclidean space of lower dimension\n`low_dim`. The mappings from high to low dimensional space are\nobtained using functions belonging to the respective RKHS. To obtain the\nmappings, we minimise a [loss function](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/train.py#L173) that is composed of three terms:\n- an MMD term between the low dimensional representations of the two views,\nwhich encourages them to have the same distribution. The RBF kernel is used\nto compute MMD.\n- two non-collapsing penalty terms (corresponding to the `pen_dual` or\n`pen_primal` functions), one for each view. These terms ensure that\nthe low dimensional representations are mutually orthogonal, preventing\ncollapsing.\n- two distortion penalties (corresponding to the `dis_dual` or\n`dis_primal` functions), one for each view. These terms encourage the\nlow dimensional representation to obtain the same pairwise structure as\nthe original views. \nMMD-MA can be formulated using either the primal (when we use the linear\nkernel in the input spaces) or the dual problem. Each has\nadvantages or disadvantages depending on the input data. For each view,\nwhen the number of features `p` is larger than the number of samples `n`\n`p >> n`, then the dual formulation is beneficial in terms\nof runtime and memory, while if `n >> p`, the primal\nformulation is favorable. \nAdditionally, in order to scale the computation of MMD to a large number of\nsamples, we propose either to use the\n[KeOps](https://www.kernel-operations.io/keops/index.html) library which\nlets you compute large kernel operations on GPUs without memory overflow.\n \n"

        "value": "A set of flags is available to determine the IO, the model, the hyperparameters\nand the seed. \n\n**Input/Output** It is possible to give as input either a path and filenames pointing to the\nuser input or to choose to generate data with the [data_pipeline.generate_data](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/data/data_pipeline.py#L13) function. In the\ncase one wants to generate simulation data, the input flags are:\n- `--data`: str, it can be either 'branch', 'triangle' or '' (default). The\nsimulated data is described in the pydoc of [data_pipeline.generate_data](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/data/data_pipeline.py#L13). ''\nmeans that simulated data is not used.\n- `--n`: int (default 300), number of samples for both views.\n- `--p`: int (default 1000), number of features for both views. \nFor data given by the user, the input flags are:\n- `--input_dir`: str (default None), input directory.\n- `--input_fv`: str (default None), filename of the array (n1 x p1 or n1 x n1)\nthat serves as first set of points.\n- `--input_sv`: str (default None), filename of the array (n2 x p2 or n2 x n2)\nthat serves as second set of points.\n- `--rd_vec`: str (default None), filename of the vector that contains the indices\nof the samples from the first view that match (ground truth) the samples from\nthe second view. This is only used at evaluation time. If `--rd_vec` is not\nused, we assume that the samples of both views follow the same ordering.\n- `--labels_fv`: str (default None), filename of the vector that contains the\nlabels of the samples from the first view. Must match the order of the samples\nin `input_fv`.\n- `--labels_sv`: str (default None), filename of the vector that contains the\nlabels of the samples from the second view, following the same ordering. \nIn both cases, two other flags are also available:\n- `--kernel`: bool (default False), whether the input data given by the user is\na kernel (n x n instead of n x p). This parameter can only be set to True when\n`--m` is 'dual'.\n- `--output_dir`: str (default None), output directory. \n**Model** The flags allow you to choose between four algorithms, using either\nthe 'primal' or 'dual' formulation, and using KeOps or not.\n- `--m`: str, either 'primal' or 'dual' (default).\n- `--keops`: integer, either 1 (use keops), 0 (not not use keops) or -1 (automatic, uses keops\nfrom 4000 samples onwards) (default).\n- `--use_unbiased_mmd`: bool (default True), determines whether or not to use\nthe unbiased version of MMD (see [Gretton et al. 2012](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/gretton12a/gretton12a.pdf) Lemma 6). \n**Seeds** The seed for the training phase, and for generating the data when\n`--data` is not '', is fixed with the flag `--seed` (int, default value is 0).\nIf one wishes to use multipe starts when training (X seeds and selection\nof the best one based on the value of the loss), it is possible to also define\nthe number of seeds to try with: `--ns` (int, default value is 1). \n**Model hyperparameters** Several hyperparameters ought to be fixed in advance:\n- `--d`: int (default 5), dimension of the latent space.\n- `--init`: str (default 'uniform,0.,0.1'), initialisation for the learned\nparameters. It can be sampled from a 'uniform', 'normal', 'xavier_uniform' or\n'xavier_normal' distributions. The parameters of the initialisation functions\nare passed to the same flag separated by a coma. See [initializers.py](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/initializers.py) and [train.py](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/train.py#L138).\n- `--l1`: float (default 1e-4), hyperparameter in front of both penalty terms. Note that\n  the penalty terms are automatically scaled by 1/sqrt(p).\n- `--l2`: float (default 1e-4), hyperparameter in front of both distortion terms. Note that\n  the distortion terms are automatically scaled by 1/(n*sqrt(p)).\n- `--lr`: float (default 1e-5), learning rate.\n- `--s`: float (default 1.0), scale parameter of the RBF kernel in MMD. \n**Training and evaluation** Several flags structure the training loop:\n- `--e`: int (default 5001), number of epochs for the training process.\n- `--ne`: int (default 100), regular interval at which the evaluation (call to\n[metrics.Evaluation](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/metrics.py))\nis done, every 'ne' epochs. 0 means that the results are never evaluated.\n- `--nr`: int (default 100), regular interval at which the components\nof the loss are recorded, every 'ne' epochs. 0 means that they are never\nrecorded. The loss is recorded every epoch nonetheless.\n- `--pca`: int (default 100), regular interval at which PCA is performed on the\nembeddings, every 'pca' epochs. 0 means that PCA is not used on the output.\n- `--short_eval`: bool (default True), whether or not to compute all the metrics\n(False) or only a set of them (True) (see [metrics.py](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/metrics.py)).\n- `--nn`: int (default 5), number of neighbours taken into account in\nthe computation of the Label Transfer Accuracy metrics. \n**Stopping criterion** Two flags enable to control the [stopping criterion](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/train.py#L293):\n- `--ws`: int (default 0), window size on which the loss is averaged for the stopping criterion. If set to 0, the algorithm stops at the last epoch without loss-based stopping criterion.\n- `--threshold`: float (default 1e-3), threshold for the stopping criterion. \n**Timing** Timing the method is possible when the flag `--time` is set to True\n(default False). \n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

To run the algorithm on simulated data from [data_pipeline.py](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/data/data_pipeline.py),\na minimal set of commands is:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m lsmmdma.main --output_dir outdir \\\n--data branch --n 300 --p 400 \\\n--e 1001 --d 5 --keops False --m dual\n```\n\n2. To run the algorithm on simulated data from [data_pipeline.py](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/lsmmdma/data/data_pipeline.py), one can\nalso choose when to record the intermediate results, to set the hyperparameters\nand to allow for 5 multiple starts:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m lsmmdma.main --output_dir outdir \\\n--data branch --n 300 --p 400 \\\n--seed 4 --ns 5 \\\n--keops False --m dual \\\n--e 1001 --nr 100 --ne 100 --pca 100 \\\n--d 5 --lr 1e-5 --l1 1e-4 --l2 1e-4 --s 1.0 --init 'uniform,0,0.1'\n```\n\n3. To run the algorithm on user input data, in the form n_sample x p_feature.\n`--data` should be '' (default) and `--kernel` should be False (default). The\nargument `--keops` can be True or False, `--m` can be 'dual' or 'primal'.\n\n```bash\npython3 -m lsmmdma.main --input_dir datadir --output_dir outdir \\\n--input_fv my_data_1 --input_sv my_data_2 --kernel False \\\n--seed 4 --ns 5 \\\n--keops True --m dual \\\n--e 1001 --nr 100 --ne 100 --pca 100 \\\n--d 5 --lr 1e-5 --l1 1e-4 --l2 1e-4 --s 1.0 --init 'uniform,0,0.1'\n```\n\n4. To run the algorithm on user kernel data, in the form n_sample x n_sample.\n`--data` should be '' (default) and `--kernel` should be True. The\nargument `--keops` can be True or False, `--m` can only be 'dual'.\n\n```bash\npython3 -m lsmmdma.main --input_dir datadir --output_dir outdir \\\n--input_fv my_data_1 --input_sv my_data_2 --kernel True \\\n--seed 4 --ns 5 \\\n--keops True --m dual \\\n--e 1001 --nr 100 --ne 100 --pca 100 \\\n--d 5 --lr 1e-5 --l1 1e-4 --l2 1e-4 --s 1.0 --init 'uniform,0,0.1'\n```\n\nA [tutorial](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/examples/tutorial101.ipynb) and a [benchmark](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/blob/master/examples/benchmark.ipynb) notebooks are also available in [examples/](https://github.com/google-research/large_scale_mmdma/tree/master/examples).\n"
