See example [output](example/example_results_control.csv). \nAlternatively, a pin-tab format that is readable by Percolator (K\u00e4ll *et al.*, 2007) can be produced, listing the same scores as features. To obtain this output format, the user needs to specify the output path (*-o*) during mistle-search with the file extension *.pin*. Note that the library label needs to be set correctly at index construction (1: target, -1: decoy libary) and the *results.pin* files of target and decoy search need to be concatenated or merged before using Percolator. It's recommended to use the this python [script](scripts/merge_pin_output.py) to merge the query results and correctly update delta scores.\n \n"

A *bias* measurement highlights how biased the *similarity* is on a few matching peaks, and a *delta_similarity* score describes the *similarity* difference between the top hit and second-best hit. Additionally, an *annotation_similarity* version of these scores exists, which accounts only for peak intensities matching reference peaks. This is useful when the library consists of fewer annotated or predicted peaks and is less noisy than the query spectra.  \nAs a high-quality discriminant scoring function we suggest the *avg_bias_adjusted_similarity*, which is composed equally of the *similarity* and *annotation similarity* metrics. Specifically, a *bias-adjusted similarity* (*sim2*) is calculated by the product of *similarity* and *(1-bias)* and is averaged between standard and annotation version. This scoring function provides excellent discrimination between target and decoy matches. \n"
