        "value": "Here's a step-by-step guide to install A-SOiD:\n\n### Step 0: Required for some Mac Users (e.g., M1 Max and M2 MacBooks)\n\nInstall Xcode Command Line Tools by running the following command in a terminal:\n\n```bash\nxcode-select --install\n```\nContinue with the steps below.\n\n### Step 1: Install Anaconda or Miniconda\nFirst, ensure you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system.\n\n- **Anaconda**: Download and install from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).\n- **Miniconda**: Download and install from [Miniconda's website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n\n> **Note**: If you already have Anaconda or Miniconda installed, you can skip this step.\n\nThe following steps assume you have Anaconda or Miniconda installed and are using a terminal or command prompt.\n\n> How to start a terminal or command prompt: [Link to Anaconda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html)\n\n### Step 2: Download the GitHub Repository\n> Step 2a and 2b are two different ways to download the repository. Choose one of the two options.\n\n#### Step 2a: Download the GitHub Repository\nEither download the GitHub repository to your local machine by clicking the green \"Code\" button and selecting \"Download ZIP\" in the \"Local\" tab.\n\n![Download ZIP](./img/download_repo.png)\n\nThen, unzip the downloaded file in your desired location.\n\n#### Step 2b: Clone the GitHub Repository\nOR use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/YttriLab/A-SOID.git\ncd repository\n```\n\n### Step 3: Navigate to the Repository Directory\nAfter cloning or unzipping, navigate to the repository directory by using the `cd` command.\nFor example, if the repository is located in `path/to/repository`, use the following command:\n\n```bash\ncd path/to/repository\n```\n> **Note**: Replace `path/to/repository` with the actual path to the repository.\n\n### Step 4: Create a Conda Environment Using the `.yml` File\nUse Conda to create an environment from the `.yml` file. \n\nThis will install the package and its dependencies into a new environment called `asoid`.\n\n```bash\nconda env create -f asoid.yml\n```\n> **Note**: This may take a few minutes to complete.\n\n> Some users (windows) might experience this [issue](https://github.com/YttriLab/A-SOID/issues/59) with building hdbscan if they have not installed C++ build tools on their machine previously. The solution is to install Microsoft C++ build tools (see link) and restart this step. This might include removing the environment and recreating it ([How to remove a conda environment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49127834/removing-conda-environment))\n\n### Step 5: Activate the New Environment\nOnce the environment is created, activate it.\n\n```bash\nconda activate asoid\n```\n> **Note**: You will need to activate the environment in each terminal in which you want to use it.\n\n### Step 7: Start A-SOiD\nStart A-SOiD by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nasoid app\n```\n\n> **Note**: This will open a new tab in your default browser. If it does not, copy the URL from the terminal and paste it into your browser.\n\n#### Expected Output\n\n```bash\n(asoid) C:\\Users\\JSchw\\PycharmProjects\\A-SOID>conda activate asoid\n\n(asoid) C:\\Users\\JSchw\\PycharmProjects\\A-SOID>asoid app\n\n  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.\n\n  Local URL: http://localhost:8501\n  Network URL: http://172.26.33.62:8501\n\n```\n\nYour browser should open to the following page (or something similar):\n![A-SOiD](./img/open_asoid_app.png)\n\n> **Note**: The first time you run A-SOiD, it may take a few seconds to load.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Updating the Environment**: If the `.yml` file is updated, you can update your environment using `conda env update -f environment.yml`.\n- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter issues, check the repository's `README` or GitHub issues for specific instructions or troubleshooting tips.\n"

No additional requirements. \n## Installation \n> **Note**: This is a quick guide to get you started. For a more detailed guide, see [Installation](docs/installation_stepbystep.md). \n### Download repository and install locally as python package within a new environment \nClone this repository and create a new environment in which A-SOiD will be installed automatically (recommended) [Anaconda/Python3](https://www.anaconda.com/). \n#### Change your current working directory to the location where you want the directory to be made.\n````\ncd path/to/A-SOiD\n````\nClone it directly from GitHub\nBASH2*\nor download ZIP and unpack where you want.  \n### Install A-SOiD using conda (recommended) \n## How to start A-SOiD: \n1.

Click on 'Preprocess' and follow the remaining workflow of the app. After successful importing the data set, you can now run the CalMS21 project as any other project in A-SOiD. \n\nThe overall runtime depends on your setup and parameters set during training, but should be completed within 1h of starting the project.\nTested on: AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX 3.30 GHz and 16 GB RAM; Windows 11 Home\n\n---"
