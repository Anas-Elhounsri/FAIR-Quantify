Be aware that BRAKER contains several parts where random variables are used, i.e.\u00a0results that you obtain when running the tests may not be exactly identical.

        "value": "-   In order to predict genes accurately in a novel genome, the genome should be masked for repeats. This will avoid the prediction of false positive gene structures in repetitive and low complexitiy regions. Repeat masking is also essential for mapping RNA-Seq data to a genome with some tools (other RNA-Seq mappers, such as HISAT2, ignore masking information). In case of GeneMark-ES/ET/EP/ETP and AUGUSTUS, softmasking (i.e.\u00a0putting repeat regions into lower case letters and all other regions into upper case letters) leads to better results than hardmasking (i.e.\u00a0replacing letters in repetitive regions by the letter `N` for unknown nucleotide). \n-   Many genomes have gene structures that will be predicted accurately with standard parameters of GeneMark-ES/ET/EP/ETP and AUGUSTUS within BRAKER. However, some genomes have clade-specific features, i.e.\u00a0special branch point model in fungi, or non-standard splice-site patterns. Please read the options section \\[options\\] in order to determine whether any of the custom options may improve gene prediction accuracy in the genome of your target species. \n-   Always check gene prediction results before further usage! You can e.g.\u00a0use a genome browser for visual inspection of gene models in context with extrinsic evidence data. BRAKER supports the generation of track data hubs for the UCSC Genome Browser with MakeHub for this purpose.\n \n"

        "value": "---------------\n\n-   *BRAKER complains that the RNA-Seq file does not correspond to the provided genome file, but I am sure the files correspond to each other!*\n\n    Please check the headers of the genome FASTA file. If the headers are long and contain whitespaces, some RNA-Seq alignment tools will truncate sequence names in the BAM file. This leads to an error with BRAKER. Solution: shorten/simplify FASTA headers in the genome file before running the RNA-Seq alignment and BRAKER.\n\n-   *GeneMark fails!*\n\n    (a) GeneMark by default only uses contigs longer than 50k for training. If you have a highly fragmented assembly, this might lead to \"no data\" for training. You can override the default minimal length by setting the BRAKER argument `--min_contig=10000`.\n\n    (b) see \"[something] failed to execute\" below.\n\n-   *[something] failed to execute!*\n\n    When providing paths to software to BRAKER, please use absolute, non-abbreviated paths. For example, BRAKER might have problems with `--SAMTOOLS_PATH=./samtools/` or `--SAMTOOLS_PATH=~/samtools/`. Please use `SAMTOOLS_PATH=/full/absolute/path/to/samtools/`, instead. This applies to all path specifications as command line options to `braker.pl`. Relative paths and absolute paths will not pose problems if you export a bash variable, instead, or if you append the location of tools to your $PATH variable.\n\n-   *GeneMark-ETP in BRAKER dies with '/scratch/11232323': No such file or directory.*\n\n    This appears to be related to sorting large files, and it's a system configuration depending problem. Solve it with `export TMPDIR=/tmp/` before calling BRAKER via Singularity.\n\n-   *BRAKER cannot find the Augustus script XYZ...*\n\n    Update Augustus from github with `git clone https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus.git`. Do not use Augustus from other sources. BRAKER is highly dependent on an up-to-date Augustus. Augustus releases happen rather rarely, updates to the Augustus scripts folder occur rather frequently.\n\n-   *Does BRAKER depend on Python3?*\n\n    It does. The python scripts employed by BRAKER are not compatible with Python2.\n\n-   *Why does BRAKER predict more genes than I expected?*\n\n    If transposable elements (or similar) have not been masked appropriately, AUGUSTUS tends to predict those elements as protein coding genes. This can lead to a huge number genes. You can check whether this is the case for your project by BLASTing (or DIAMONDing) the predicted protein sequences against themselves (all vs. all) and counting how many of the proteins have a high number of high quality matches. You can use the output of this analysis to divide your gene set into two groups: the protein coding genes that you want to find and the repetitive elements that were additionally predicted.\n\n-   *I am running BRAKER in Anaconda and something fails...*\n\n    Update AUGUSTUS and BRAKER from github with `git clone https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/Augustus.git` and `git clone https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER.git`. The Anaconda installation is great, but it relies on releases of AUGUSTUS and BRAKER - which are often lagging behind. Please use the current GitHub code, instead.\n\n-   *Why and where is the GenomeThreader support gone?*\n\n     BRAKER is a joint project between teams from University of Greifswald and Georgia Tech. While the group of Mark Bordovsky from Georgia Tech contributes GeneMark expertise, the group of Mario Stanke from University of Greifswald contributes AUGUSTUS expertise. Using GenomeThreader to build training genes for AUGUSTUS in BRAKER circumvents execution of GeneMark. Thus, the GenomeThreader mode is strictly speaking not part of the BRAKER project. The previous functionality of BRAKER with GenomeThreader has been moved to GALBA at <https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/GALBA>. Note that GALBA has also undergone extension for using Miniprot instead of GenomeThreader.\n\n-   *My BRAKER gene set has too many BUSCO duplicates!*\n\n    AUGUSTUS within BRAKER can predict alternative splicing isoforms. Also the merge of the AUGUSTUS and GeneMark gene set by TSEBRA within BRAKER may result in additional isoforms for a single gene. The BUSCO duplicates usually come from alternative splicing isoforms, i.e. they are expected.\n\n-   *Augustus and/or etraining within BRAKER complain that the file `aug_cmdln_parameters.json` is missing. Even though I am using the latest Singularity container!*\n\n    BRAKER copies the AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH folder to a writable location. In older versions of Augustus, that file was indeed not existing. If the local writable copy of a folder already exists, BRAKER will not re-copy it. Simply delete the old folder. (It is often `~/.augustus`, so you can simply do `rm -rf ~/.augustus`; the folder might be residing in $PWD if your home directory was not writable).\n\n-   *I sit behind a firewall, compleasm cannot download the BUSCO files, what can I do?* See Issue https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER/issues/785#issuecomment-2079787188\n"

Sources are located in `Augustus/auxprogs/bam2hints`. Make sure that you compile `bam2hints` on your system (it should be automatically compiled when AUGUSTUS is compiled, but in case of problems with `bam2hints`, please read troubleshooting instructions in `Augustus/auxprogs/bam2hints/README`).\n\nSince BRAKER is a pipeline that trains AUGUSTUS, i.e.\u00a0writes species specific parameter files, BRAKER needs writing access to the configuration directory of AUGUSTUS that contains such files (`Augustus/config/`). If you install AUGUSTUS globally on your system, the `config` folder will typically not be writable by all users. Either make the directory where `config` resides recursively writable to users of AUGUSTUS, or copy the `config/` folder (recursively) to a location where users have writing permission.\n\nAUGUSTUS will locate the `config` folder by looking for an environment variable `$AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH`. If the `$AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH`\nenvironment variable is not set, then BRAKER will look in the path `../config` relative to the directory in which it finds an AUGUSTUS\nexecutable. Alternatively, you can supply the variable as a command line argument to BRAKER (`--AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/your_path_to_AUGUSTUS/Augustus/config/`). We recommend that you export the variable e.g.\u00a0for your current bash\nsession:\n\n```\n    export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/your_path_to_AUGUSTUS/Augustus/config/\n```\n\nIn order to make the variable available to all Bash sessions, add the above line to a startup script, e.g.\u00a0`~/.bashrc`.\n\nPlease have a look at the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in case you want to install AUGUSTUS as Debian package. A number of scripts needs to be patched, then.\n"

BRAKER highly depends in particular on an up-to-date Augustus/scripts directory, and other sources are often lagging behind.***\n\nYou should compile AUGUSTUS on your own system in order to avoid problems with versions of libraries used by AUGUSTUS. Compilation instructions are provided in the AUGUSTUS `README.TXT` file (`Augustus/README.txt`).\n\nAUGUSTUS consists of `augustus`, the gene prediction tool, additional C++ tools located in `Augustus/auxprogs` and Perl scripts located in `Augustus/scripts`. Perl scripts must be executable (see instructions in section [BRAKER components](#executability).\n\nThe C++ tool `bam2hints` is an essential component of BRAKER when run with RNA-Seq. Sources are located in `Augustus/auxprogs/bam2hints`. Make sure that you compile `bam2hints` on your system (it should be automatically compiled when AUGUSTUS is compiled, but in case of problems with `bam2hints`, please read troubleshooting instructions in `Augustus/auxprogs/bam2hints/README`).\n\nSince BRAKER is a pipeline that trains AUGUSTUS, i.e.\u00a0writes species specific parameter files, BRAKER needs writing access to the configuration directory of AUGUSTUS that contains such files (`Augustus/config/`). If you install AUGUSTUS globally on your system, the `config` folder will typically not be writable by all users. Either make the directory where `config` resides recursively writable to users of AUGUSTUS, or copy the `config/` folder (recursively) to a location where users have writing permission.\n\nAUGUSTUS will locate the `config` folder by looking for an environment variable `$AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH`. If the `$AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH`\nenvironment variable is not set, then BRAKER will look in the path `../config` relative to the directory in which it finds an AUGUSTUS\nexecutable. Alternatively, you can supply the variable as a command line argument to BRAKER (`--AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/your_path_to_AUGUSTUS/Augustus/config/`). We recommend that you export the variable e.g.\u00a0for your current bash\nsession:\n\n```\n    export AUGUSTUS_CONFIG_PATH=/your_path_to_AUGUSTUS/Augustus/config/\n```\n\nIn order to make the variable available to all Bash sessions, add the above line to a startup script, e.g.\u00a0`~/.bashrc`.\n\nPlease have a look at the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) in case you want to install AUGUSTUS as Debian package. A number of scripts needs to be patched, then.\n"

However, there are now a number of additional pipelines included in BRAKER. In the following, we give an overview of possible input files and pipelines:\n\n-   Genome file, only. In this mode, GeneMark-ES is trained on the genome sequence, alone. Long genes predicted by GeneMark-ES are selected for training AUGUSTUS. Final predictions by AUGUSTUS are *ab initio*. This approach will likely yield lower prediction accuracy than all other here described pipelines. (see Figure [2](#fig1)),\n\n\n![braker2-main-a\\[fig1\\]](docs/figs/braker-es.png)\n\nFigure 2: BRAKER pipeline A: training GeneMark-ES on genome data, only; *ab initio* gene prediction withAUGUSTUS\n\n\n-   Genome and RNA-Seq file from the same species (see figure [3](#fig2)); this approach is suitable for short read RNA-Seq libraries with a good coverage of the transcriptome, **important:** this approach requires that each intron is covered by many alignments, i.e.\u00a0it does not work with assembled transcriptome mappings. In principle, also alignments of long read RNA-Seq data may lead to sufficient data for running BRAKER, but only if each transcript that will go into training was sequenced and aligned to the genome multiple times. Please be aware that at the current point in time, BRAKER does not officially support the integration of long read RNA-Seq data, yet.\n\n![braker2-main-b\\[fig2\\]](docs/figs/braker1.png)\n\nFigure 3: BRAKER pipeline B: training GeneMark-ET supported by RNA-Seq spliced alignment information, prediction with AUGUSTUS with that same spliced alignment information.\n\n\n-   Genome file and database of proteins that may be of **unknown** evolutionary distance to the target species (see Figure [4](#fig3)); this approach is particularly suitable if no RNA-Seq data is available. This method will work better with proteins from species that are rather close to the target species, but accuracy will drop only very little if the reference proteins are more distant from the target species. **Important:** This approach requires a database of protein families, i.e.\u00a0many representatives of each protein family must be present in the database.

        "value": "This approach is suitable for genomes of species for which RNA-Seq libraries with good transcriptome coverage are available and for which protein data is not at hand. The pipeline is illustrated in Figure [2](#fig1).\n\nBRAKER has several ways to receive RNA-Seq data as input:\n\n-   You can provide ID(s) of RNA-Seq libraries from SRA (in case of multiple IDs, separate them by comma) as argument to `--rnaseq_sets_ids`. The libraries belonging to the IDs are then downloaded automatically by BRAKER, e.g.:\n\n    ```\n        braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \\\n           --rnaseq_sets_ids=SRA_ID1,SRA_ID2\n    ```\n\n-   You can use local `FASTQ` file(s) of unaligned reads as input. In this case, you have to provide BRAKER with the ID(s) of the RNA-Seq set(s) as argument to `--rnaseq_sets_ids` and the path(s) to the directories, where the `FASTQ` files are located as argument to `--rnaseq_sets_dirs`. For each ID `ID`, BRAKER will search in these directories for one `FASTQ` file named `ID.fastq` if the reads are unpaired, or for two `FASTQ` files named `ID_1.fastq` and `ID_2.fastq` if they are paired.\n\n    For example, if you have a paired library called 'SRA_ID1' and an unpaired library named 'SRA_ID2', you have to have a directory `/path/to/local/fastq/files/`, where the files `SRA_ID1_1.fastq`, `SRA_ID1_2.fastq`, and `SRA_ID2.fastq` reside. Then, you could run BRAKER with following command:\n\n    ```\n        braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \\\n           --rnaseq_sets_ids=SRA_ID1,SRA_ID2 \\\n           --rnaseq_sets_dirs=/path/to/local/fastq/files/\n    ```\n\n-   There are two ways of supplying BRAKER with RNA-Seq data as `bam` file(s). First, you can do it in the same way as you would supply `FASTQ` file(s): Provide the ID(s)/name(s) of your `bam` file(s) as argument to `--rnaseq_sets_ids` and specify directories where the `bam` files reside with `--rnaseq_sets_dirs`. BRAKER will automatically detect that these ID(s) are `bam` and not `FASTQ` file(s), e.g.:\n    ```\n        braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \\\n           --rnaseq_sets_ids=BAM_ID1,BAM_ID2 \\\n           --rnaseq_sets_dirs=/path/to/local/bam/files/\n    ```\n    Second, you can specify the paths to your `bam` file(s) directly, e.g.\ncan either extract RNA-Seq spliced alignment information from `bam` files, or it can use such extracted information, directly.\n    ```\n        braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \\\n           --bam=file1.bam,file2.bam\n    ```\n\n    Please note that we generally assume that bam files were generated with HiSat2 because that is the aligner that would also be executed by BRAKER3 with fastq input. If you want for some reason to generate the bam files with STAR, use the option `--outSAMstrandField intronMotif` of STAR to produce files that are compatible wiht StringTie in BRAKER3.\n\n-   In order to run BRAKER with RNA-Seq spliced alignment information that has already been extracted, run:\n\n    ```\n        braker.pl --species=yourSpecies --genome=genome.fasta \\\n           --hints=hints1.gff,hints2.gff\n    ```\n    The format of such a hints file must be as follows (tabulator separated file):\n    ```\n        chrName b2h intron  6591    8003    1   +   .   pri=4;src=E\n        chrName b2h intron  6136    9084    11  +   .   mult=11;pri=4;src=E\n        ...\n    ```\n    The source `b2h` in the second column and the source tag `src=E` in the last column are essential for BRAKER to determine whether a hint has been generated from RNA-Seq data.\n\nIt is also possible to provide RNA-Seq sets in different ways for the same BRAKER run, any combination of above options is possible. It is not recommended to provide RNA-Seq data with `--hints` if you run BRAKER in ETPmode (RNA-Seq *and* protein data), because GeneMark-ETP won't use these hints!  \n"

The instructions on how to prepare the input OrthoDB proteins are documented here: https://github.com/gatech-genemark/ProtHint#protein-database-preparation.\n\nYou can of course add additional protein sequences to that file, or try with a completely different database. Any database will need several representatives for each protein, though.\n\nInstead of having BRAKER run ProtHint, you can also start BRAKER with hints already produced by ProtHint, by providing ProtHint's `prothint_augustus.gff` output:\n\n    braker.pl --genome=genome.fa --hints=prothint_augustus.gff\n\nThe format of `prothint_augustus.gff` in this mode looks like this:\n\n```\n2R ProtHint intron 11506230 11506648 4 + . src=M;mult=4;pri=4\n2R ProtHint intron 9563406  9563473  1 + . grp=69004_0:001de1_702_g;src=C;pri=4;\n2R ProtHint intron 8446312  8446371  1 + . grp=43151_0:001cae_473_g;src=C;pri=4;\n2R ProtHint intron 8011796  8011865  2 - . src=P;mult=1;pri=4;al_score=0.12;\n2R ProtHint start  234524   234526   1 + . src=P;mult=1;pri=4;al_score=0.08;\n```\n\nThe prediction of all hints with `src=M` will be enforced. Hints with `src=C` are 'chained evidence', i.e. they will only be incorporated if all members of the group (grp=...) can be incorporated in a single transcript.

In a last step, the predictions of AUGUSTUS and GeneMark-ETP are combined using TSEBRA.\n\n**Alignment of RNA-Seq reads**\n\nGeneMark-ETP utilizes Stringtie2 to assemble RNA-Seq data, which requires that the aligned reads (BAM files) contain the XS (strand) tag for spliced reads. Therefore, if you align your reads with HISAT2, you must enable the --dta option, or if you use STAR, you must use the --outSAMstrandField intronMotif option. TopHat alignments include this tag by default.\n\nTo call the pipeline in this mode, you have to provide it with a protein database using `--prot_seq` (as described in [BRAKER with protein data](#braker-with-protein-data)), and RNA-Seq data either by their SRA ID so that they are downloaded by BRAKER, as unaligned reads in `FASTQ` format, and/or as aligned reads in `bam` format (as described in [BRAKER with RNA-Seq data](#braker-with-rna-seq-data)).

If not, the following decision schema is applied to re-run TSEBRA to minimize the missing BUSCOs in the final output of BRAKER (always braker.gtf). If an alternative and better gene set is created, the original braker.gtf gene set is moved to a directory called braker_original.
