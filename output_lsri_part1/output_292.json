We recommend using https://cov2tree.org/?treenomeEnabled=true (developed by [Theo Sanderson](https://github.com/theosanderson/taxodium) and Alexander Kramer) to visualize this tree and its genotypes.** \nUShER is now a package consisting of a family of programs for rapid phylogenetic analyses, particularly suitable for the SARS-CoV-2 genomes.  \n* **UShER** is a program that rapidly places new samples onto an existing phylogeny using maximum parsimony. It is particularly helpful in understanding the relationships of newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes with each other and with previously sequenced genomes in a global phylogeny. This has emerged as an important challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic for enabling *genomic contact tracing* since the viral phylogeny is already very large (>2M sequences) and is expected to grow by many fold in the coming months. UShER is much faster than existing tools with similar functionality and has now also been integrated in the [UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace), which does not require UShER installation and usage know-how as described below for SARS-CoV-2 applications. If you have sensitive data that cannot be shared over the Internet, consider using [ShUShER](https://shusher.gi.ucsc.edu/), developed by Alex Kramer (https://github.com/amkram/shusher), as an alternative to the Genome Browser. UShER uses the mutation-annotated tree (MAT) data format, which is a phylogenetic tree in which the branches are annotated with the mutations that have been inferred to have occurred on them. \n* **matUtils** is a toolkit for querying, interpreting and manipulating the mutation-annotated trees (MATs). Using matUtils, common operations in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and contact tracing efforts, including annotating a MAT with new clades, extracting subtrees of the most closely-related samples, or converting the MAT to standard Newick or VCF format can be performed in a matter of seconds to minutes even on a laptop. \n* **matOptimize** is a program to rapidly and effectively optimize a mutation-annotated tree (MAT) for parsimony using subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) moves within a user-defined radius.\n* **RIPPLES** is a program that uses a phylogenomic technique to rapidly and sensitively detect recombinant nodes and their ancestors in a mutation-annotated tree (MAT).   \n\nPlease refer to our [wiki](https://usher-wiki.readthedocs.io/) for detailed instructions on installing and using the UShER package. \n \n"

        "description": "Major changes:\r\n* Introducing `matUtils`utility with the following functionality\r\n  - `summary` provides a summary information for an input MAT, such as the number of nodes, leaves, parsimony score, clades etc.\r\n  - `extract` takes an input MAT and can extract a subset (such as a mutation-annotated subtree of user-specified input samples) and produces an output MAT, Newick tree, VCF or JSON. It also contains a long list of commands to extract other useful information from a MAT such as mutation paths for a set of samples. \r\n  - `annotate` can be used to annotate internal nodes of an input MAT with clade names \r\n  -  `uncertainty`can be used to calculate uncertainty metrics, such as the number of equally parsimonious placements for a given sample\r\n* Introducing a preliminary version of `matOptimize` that can be used to optimize the parsimony score of an input MAT using tree moves\r\n* Protobuf format changed to accommodate the above two changes. `matToVcf` function has been moved to `matUtils extract`\r\n* `Fasta2UShER` has been replaced by a set of bash commands\r\n* Several performance optimizations",
