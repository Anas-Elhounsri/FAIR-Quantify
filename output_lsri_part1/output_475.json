Running this shell script can be automated using Watchtower's [lifecycle hooks](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/lifecycle-hooks/). Previously, a sysadmin would have to manually run `docker exec` to execute these commands.\r\n\r\n",

Ok, so we are not great at acronyms; but like a flavorful rice pilaf that combines many ingredients, this RicePilaf combines information from multiple rice databases to provide insights into your QTL/GWAS loci.\r\n\r\n ## Installation and Usage \r\nPlease visit the [wiki](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/rice-pilaf/wiki).\r\n\r\n ## Changelog\r\n- Rewrote the (data preparation) workflow Dockerfile. Previously, R 4.3 and Bioconductor 3.17 were installed on top of the `python:3.10-bullseye` base image. For reproducibility, it is imperative to use these versions of R and Bioconductor. However, the most recent version of Bioconductor (3.19) requires R 4.4, while attempting to install Bioconductor 3.17 packages from source leads to dependency issues. \r\n\r\n   As a solution, we rewrote the Dockerfile to use the [`bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_17-R-4.3.0`](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) base image instead. Aside from simplifying the installation of R packages, this change also reduced the image building time from ~24 minutes to ~8 minutes.\r\n\r\n- Simplified the logic for deciding on whether to fetch the Bootstrap and Font Awesome stylesheets and sprites via the jsDelivr CDN or to use the self-hosted versions\r\n\r\n- Added more code documentation, as well as GitHub Actions workflow documentation",

Note that these cron jobs are triggered only in the version of the app intended for deployment. Moreover, sending app usage logs is entirely optional and requires express consent from the organization deploying RicePilaf and an authorized service key from us. The logs will be used only to help us improve RicePilaf.

Ok, so we are not great at acronyms; but like a flavorful rice pilaf that combines many ingredients, this RicePilaf combines information from multiple rice databases to provide insights into your QTL/GWAS loci.\r\n\r\n ## Installation and Usage \r\nPlease visit the [wiki](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/rice-pilaf/wiki).\r\n\r\n ## Changelog\r\n- Enforced distinction between locally installed version and deployed version. For example, a locally installed version should display the \"Clear Cache\" button, while the deployed version should not display it\r\n- Edited the Dockerfile for the locally installed version (`app`) so as to not use uwsgi and nginx and instead just use Flask's built-in server. This resulted in a ~360 MB decrease in the size of the image\r\n- Created a separate Dockerfile for the deployed version (`deploy`), which uses uwsgi and nginx. Previously, this was the Dockerfile for the locally installed version (`app`), with the addition of an extra command for specifying that the app should run in deployed mode\r\n- Incorporated the Dockerization of the deployed version into the GitHub Actions workflow. There are now three images in the GitHub Container Registry (`app`, `workflow`, and `deploy`)\r\n- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to include information on raising issues, contributing to the codebase, license, code of covenant, and contact",
