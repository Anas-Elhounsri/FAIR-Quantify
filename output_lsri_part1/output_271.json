The core algorithm of both programs involves gene calling, mapping of predicted ORFs against a protein database, and voting-based classification of the entire contig / MAG based on classification of the individual ORFs. CAT and BAT can be run from intermediate steps if files are formated appropriately.\n\nA paper describing the algorithm together with extensive benchmarks can be found at https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1817-x.

        "value": "When we want to confidently go down to the lowest taxonomic level possible for a classification, an important assumption is that on that level conflict between classifications could have arisen. Namely, if there were conflicting classifications, the algorithm would have made the classification more conservative by moving up a level. Since it did not, we can trust the low-level classification. However, it is not always possible for conflict to arise, because in some cases no other sequences from the clade are present in the database. This is true for example for the family Dehalococcoidaceae, which in our databases is the sole representative of the order Dehalococcoidales. Thus, here we cannot confidently state that an classification on the family level is more correct than an classification on the order level. For these cases, CAT and BAT mark the lineage with asterisks, starting from the lowest level classification up to the level where conflict could have arisen because the clade contains multiple taxa with database entries. The user is advised to examine starred taxa more carefully, for example by analysing sequence identity between predicted ORFs and hits, or move up the lineage to a confident classification (i.e. the first classification without an asterisk). \nIf you do not want the asterisks in your output files, you can add the `--no_stars` flag to CAT or BAT.\n \n"

        "value": "RAT estimates the taxonomic composition of metagenomes by integrating taxonomic signals from MAGs, contigs, and reads. RAT has been added to the CAT pack from version 6.0.\nTo use RAT, you need the CAT pack database files (see [Getting started](#getting-started) for more information). \nRAT makes an integrated profile using MAGs/bins, contigs, and reads. To specify which elements should be integrated, use the `--mode` argument. Possible letters for `--mode` are `m` (for MAGs), `c` (for contigs), and `r` (for reads). All combinations of the three letters are possible, except `r` alone.\nTo run RAT's complete workflow, specify the mode, read files, contig files, bin folder, and database files:\n```\n$ CAT_pack reads --mode mcr -b bin_folder/ -c contigs.fasta -1 forward_reads.fq.gz -2 reverse_reads.fq.gz -d db/ -t tax/\n```\nCurrently, RAT supports single read files as well as paired-end read files. Interlaced read files are currently not supported. RAT will run CAT and BAT on the contigs and MAGs, will map the reads back to the contigs, and then try to annotate any unmapped reads separately.\nIf you already have a sorted mapping file, you can supply it and RAT will skip the mapping step:\n```\n\n$ CAT_pack reads --mode mcr -b bin_folder/ -c contigs.fasta --bam1 mapping_file_sorted.bam -1 forward_reads.fq.gz -2 reverse_reads.fq.gz -d db/ -t tax/\n```\nIf CAT and/or BAT have already been run on your data, you can supply the output files to RAT to skip the CAT and BAT runs:\n```\n\n$ CAT_pack reads --mode mcr -b bin_folder/ -c contigs.fasta -1 forward_reads.fq.gz -2 reverse_reads.fq.gz -d db/ -t tax/ --c2c CAT_contig2classification_file.txt --b2c BAT_bin2classification_file.txt\n```\nSimilarly, if a previous RAT run crashed after the unmapped reads have already been aligned to the database with diamond, you can supply the intermediate files to continue the run:\n```\n\n$ CAT_pack reads --mode mcr -b bin_folder/ -c contigs.fasta -1 forward_reads.fq.gz -2 reverse_reads.fq.gz -d db/ -t tax/ --c2c CAT_contig2classification_file.txt --b2c BAT_bin2classification_file.txt --alignment_unmapped unmapped_alignment_file.diamond\n```\nAfter a RAT run is finished, you can run add_names on the abundance files (only for RAT runs with nr database):\n```\n\n$ CAT_pack add_names -i RAT.completete_abundance_file.txt -o RAT.completete_abundance_file_with_names.txt -t tax/ \n```\nSimilar to CAT and BAT, the paths to all dependencies can be supplied via an argument:\n```\n\n$ CAT_pack reads --mode mcr -b bin_folder/ -c contigs.fasta -1 forward_reads.fq.gz -2 reverse_reads.fq.gz -d db/ -t tax/ --path_to_samtools /path/to/samtools\n```\n \n"

A big shout-out to NCBI for picking up our bug report and combining information from multiple resources into a single mapping file!\r\n* Another update to `CAT prepare`: file integrity of downloads is assessed based on md5 checksums.\r\n* **Change to the output files:** the ORF2LCA output file contains a new column for the number of hits the classification is based on.\r\n* **Change to the output files:** the 'classification' column in the output files previously contained the verdicts `classified` and `unclassified`. These two options are now called `taxid assigned` and `no taxid assigned`, respectively, in order to prevent confusion about cases where a contig or bin is classified but does not have a classification up to rank superkingdom.\r\n* **Change to the output files:** while converting to official ranks with `CAT add_names`, if a classification does not go to lower ranks this is now called `no support` as opposed to the previous `not classified`. This should prevent confusion about the meaning of 'classified' even further!",

        "description": "The publication of the CAT/BAT paper is near, we celebrate this with a brand new release!\r\n\r\n# Notable changes\r\n* **WARNING:** We have simplified the output table format! The old `number of ORFs on contig / in a bin` and `number of ORFs a classification is based on` are now replaced by one `reason` column. In case of an unclassified sequence, the reason for this is shown in this column as well. Simple is nice! Just make sure you're parsing the new output format correctly...\r\n* Per request, `add_names` now has an option to *not* show the bit-score support scores in the lineage! You can enable it with the `--exclude_scores` flag.\r\n\r\n     This means that your output can look like this (default, with scores included):\r\n\r\n     `... Thermaceae: 1.00_____Thermus: 1.00_____Thermus thermophilus: 0.91`\r\n\r\n     or like this (with the `--exclude_scores` flag):\r\n\r\n     `...

The familiar `./CAT bins` is still the go-to option if you want to classify multiple MAGs, but if it's only one MAG you are interested in try out `./CAT bin` (notice the bin is singular)! An added benefit of single bin mode is that you can use the alignment and predicted protein files of the BAT run to classify individual contigs within the MAG with CAT, or the other way around. Thus, you will only have to do the most time consuming and disk space clogging steps (protein prediction and alignment) once to classify both the entire MAG and the contigs within! Pretty neat, isn't it?",

This will increase sensitivity but will make alignment considerably slower.\n- Setting the `--block_size` parameter lower will decrease memory and temporary disk space usage. Setting it higher will increase performance.\n- For high memory machines, it is adviced to set `--index_chunks` to 1 (currently the default).

A 2-column, tab-separated file containing the mapping of each sequence in the fasta file to a taxid in the taxonomy.\nThis file must contain the header `accession.version\ttaxid`.\n\nAn example looks like this\n\n```\naccession.version\ttaxid\nprotein_1\t562\nprotein_2\t123456\n```\n\nOnce all of the above requirements are met you can run `CAT_pack prepare`.\nAll the input  needs to be explicitly specified for `CAT_pack prepare` to work, for example:\n\n```\n$ CAT_pack prepare \\\n--db_fasta path/to/fasta \\\n--names path/to/names.dmp \\\n--nodes path/to/nodes.dmp \\\n--acc2tax path/to/acc2taxid.txt.gz \\\n--db_dir path/to/output_dir\n```\n\nwill create an `output_dir` that will look like this\n\n```\noutput_dir\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 2023-11-05_CAT_pack.log\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 db\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2023-11-05_CAT_pack.dmnd\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 2023-11-05_CAT_pack.fastaid2LCAtaxid\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 2023-11-05_CAT_pack.taxids_with_multiple_offspring\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tax\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 names.dmp\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 nodes.dmp\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- The two subdirs `db` and `tax` are created that contain all necessary files.\n- The `nodes.dmp` and `names.dmp` in the `tax` directory are copied from their original location.\nThis is to ensure that the `-t` flag of CAT, BAT, and RAT work.\n- The default prefix is `<YYYY-MM-DD>_CAT_pack`.

This will increase sensitivity but will make alignment considerably slower.\n- Setting the `--block_size` parameter lower will decrease memory and temporary disk space usage. Setting it higher will increase performance.\n- For high memory machines, it is adviced to set `--index_chunks` to 1 (currently the default). This parameter has no effect on temprary disk space usage.\n- You can specify the location of temporary DIAMOND files with the `--tmpdir` argument.\n"
