Navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiPhase/releases/latest) and download the tarball file (e.g. `hiphase-{version}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`).\n2. Decompress the tar file.\n3. (Optional) Verify the md5 checksum.\n4. Test the binary file by running it with the help option (`-h`).\n5. Visit the [User guide](./user_guide.md) for details on running HiPhase.\n\n### Example with v0.7.2\n```bash\n# modify this to update the version\nVERSION=\"v0.7.2\"\n# get the release file\nwget https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/HiPhase/releases/download/${VERSION}/hiphase-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\n# decompress the file into folder ${VERSION}\ntar -xzvf hiphase-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\ncd hiphase-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\n# optional, check the md5 sum\nmd5sum -c hiphase.md5\n# execute help instructions\n./hiphase -h\n```"

        "description": "## Changes\r\n* **Major changes to dual-mode allele assignment:** Prior to this version, global realignment would revert to local realignment if the CPU cost (in seconds) exceeded a user provided threshold. While this was useful for fast-tracking noisy phase blocks, it could lead to non-deterministic output as CPU costs can vary. The thresholding has been reworked such that global realignment will revert to local realignment *for an individual mapping* if the edit distance exceeds a user provided threshold (default: 500). Additionally, global realignment will revert to local realignment *for the remainder of a putative phase block* if too many reads have reverted to local realignment (default: 50%, minimum number of failures: 50 mappings). This has the following downstream impact on results:\r\n  * All results from HiPhase are **fully deterministic** from run to run.\r\n  * Baseline quality scores for local realignment have been adjusted to scale at the same relative ratios as those from global realignment. \r\n    * When running HiPhase on _only_ small variants (e.g., local realignment mode only), this tended to slightly increase the number of switch flip errors relative to v1.3.0.\r\n    * When running HiPhase on small, structural, and tandem repeat variants (recommended), we observed a small decrease in switch flip errors relative to v1.3.0.\r\n  * Relative to v1.3.0, we observed reduced run-time costs for all tests (~25% reduction in both CPU time and wall-clock time, on average).\r\n  * The number of mappings processed through global/local realignment are now tracked in the `--stats-file`.\r\n* **Global realignment is now on by default**, reflecting our overall recommended usage of HiPhase. This can be disabled with the `--disable-global-realignment` option.\r\n* **CLI changes:** The CLI has been updated to reflect the above algorithmic changes. These new CLI options have been added to reflect the changes:\r\n  * `--disable-global-realignment` - This option will disable all global realignments; it is recommended if only small variant files are available for phasing\r\n  * `--global-realignment-max-ed <DISTANCE>` - Controls the maximum allowed edit distance before reverting an individual mapping to local realignment (default: 500)\r\n  * `--max-global-failure-ratio <FRAC>` - Controls the maximum allowed failure rates for global realignment before reverting the rest of the phase block to local realignment (default: 50%)\r\n  * `--global-failure-count <COUNT>` - Controls the minimum number of failures required before the failure rate check is enabled (default: 50)\r\n  * `--global-realignment-cputime <SECONDS>` - **Deprecated**, this option is now hidden on the CLI. It will produce a warning if used but has no impact on the downstream results.",

Instead of unphased singletons, these are now grouped into larger unphased blocks. Phased variants are unaffected by this change.\r\n  - This has a major impact on I/O churning, especially in centromeric and telomeric regions. Internal tests show up to 60% reduction in wall clock time with 16 threads accompanied by up to 30% reduction in CPU time depending on the phasing mode.\r\n  - There are now fewer total phase blocks reported due to the singleton collapse. This primarily impacts the statistic tracking optional outputs of HiPhase.\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n- Fixed a related issue where unphased singleton blocks were falsely tagged with `TR_OVERLAP`\r\n- Fixed an issue where the default `--io-threads` frequently caused issues on long-running jobs. This now defaults to `min(--threads, 4)`, but can still be specified with `--io-threads`.",
