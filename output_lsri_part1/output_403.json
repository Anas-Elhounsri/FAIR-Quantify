In Ubuntu:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip \nsudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit  # This will install the latest version of CUDA. Read below before proceed\n```\nFor CUDA installation, refer to the documentation [\\[LINK\\]](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) to install a specific version.\n\nThen, to install `homs-tc`:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tycheyoung/homs-tc.git\ncd homs-tc\n./install.sh\n```\n"

All parameters should be defined.\n* preprocessing\n  - min_spectra_ref: the minimum number of referenece spectra required for each charge. If it is below the threshold, the reference spectra with the corresponding charge are excluded from the search.\n  - min_spectra_query: the minimum number of query spectra required for each charge. If it is below the threshold, the query spectra with the corresponding charge are excluded from the search.\n  - resolution: the number of decimal places to round the `m/z`\n  - bin_size: the bin width (in `Da`) for raw spectra to spectrum vector conversion\n  - min_mz: the min m/z value to consider (inclusive) during preprocessing\n  - max_mz: the max m/z value to consider (inclusive) during preprocessing\n  - remove_precursor: a flag (boolean) to eliminate peaks near the precursor mass. Can be either `true` or `false`\n  - remove_precursor_tolerance: a `m/z` window to eliminate peaks near the precursor mass\n  - min_intensity: remove peaks with a lower intensity relative to the base peak intensity\n  - min_peaks: a cutoff for discarding spectra with with fewer peaks\n  - min_mz_range: a threshold to discard low-quality spectra with narrow mass range\n  - max_peaks_used: the specified limit of the most intense peaks to retain for query spectra\n  - max_peaks_used_library: the specified limit of the most intense peaks to retain for reference spectra\n  - scaling: the method of scaling peak intensities, either square root (\"sqrt\") or rank-based (\"rank\")\n\n* search\n  - precursor_tolerance_mass_ppm: narrow window size (standard search - 1st stage of cascade search)\n  - precursor_tolerance_mass_open_da: wide window size (open search - 2nd stage of cascade search)\n  - max_ref_batch_size: batch size for reference hypervectors during the search stage\n  - max_query_batch_size: batch size for query hypervectors during the search stage\n  - hv_quantize_level: the quantization level of hypervector during the encoding stage\n  - hv_dimensionality: the hypervector dimensionality\n  - hv_precision: the hypervector precision. Can be either `fp32` or `fp16` or `int8`\n  - use_precomputed_ref_hvs: a flag (boolean) to use dumped reference HVs. If there are no existing dump files, it will generate dump first. Can be either `true` or `false`. Usually, generating reference on-the-fly is faster than loading precomputed HVs.\n\n* fdr\n  - fdr_threshold: the FDR threshold for each stage of the cascade search\n  - fdr_tolerance_mass: the bin width to group SSMs for subgroup FDR calculation during the second stage of the cascade search.\n  - fdr_tolerance_mode: the unit of `fdr_tolerance_mass`. Can be either `Da` or `ppm`\n  - fdr_min_group_size: the minimum group size to perform FDR control individually for that subgroup.\n"
