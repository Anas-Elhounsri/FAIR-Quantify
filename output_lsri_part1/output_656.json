Specifically:\n\n1. pull the latest changes from the master branch\n```bash\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n```\n\n2. create your branch\n```bash\ngit checkout -b your-branch\n```\n\n3. make changes, run `devtools::test()` and/or `devtools::check()` and commit\n\n4. push changes to the remote\n```bash\ngit push -u origin your-branch\n```\n\n5. open a pull request in the github UI to the master branch.\n\n**Make sure your branch can be fast-forwarded or cleanly rebased onto the master branch.**  In the case that this cannot be done automatically in the github UI, you can do this by rebasing locally and resolving any conflicts, then force-pushing your changes to your branch:\n\n1. pull the latest changes from the master branch\n```bash\ngit checkout master\ngit pull\n```\n\n2. rebase your branch onto the master branch\n```bash\ngit checkout your-branch\ngit rebase -i master\n```\n\nThe -i flag gives some control over how you want to rebase.  You can squash commits, edit commit messages, etc.  Omit the -i flag if you just want to do a default rebase attempt.  If you have conflicts, you will need to resolve them and then continue the rebase process.\n\n3. run `devtools::test()` and/or `devtools::check()`\n\n4. force push your branch to the remote\n```bash\ngit push origin your-branch --force\n```\n\nWe prefer using rebase to merge, as merge can create very messy, unintuitive history.  We are also assuming people are all branching off of master, so no one will have branched off of your branch before you rewrite the history with rebase.\n\n### Outside pmartR team\n\n*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"pmartR/pmartR\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n## Testing and Deployment\n\n### Local Checks\n\nWhenever making significant code changes, run `devtools::test()` and ensure that all tests pass.  A more complete check of the code can be run using `devtools::check()`.\n\n### Running Automatic Checks\n\nWe use automatic checks via github actions to make sure code is formatted correctly, tests pass, examples run, etc.  These run when a pull request to master is created/edited or a manual run is triggered.  See the documentation for [github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more info and the `.github/workflows` folder for the yaml files that specify the actions to be performed and when they will be run.  Manual triggers of workflows can be done as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow)\n\nWe include a github actions workflow to optionally run `rhub` (https://github.com/r-hub/rhub) checks.  Depending on where the branch you want to test is, you can run:\n\n```r\nrhub::rhub_check(gh_url = 'https://github.com/pmartR/pmartR', branch = 'your-branch')\n```\n\nWhere you can replace the `gh_url` with the address of your fork if you are working from one.  This will prompt you to, among other things, select several environments/containers (e.g. ubuntu, arm64 mac) to run CRAN-like checks on.  Once completed, a series of jobs will spin up under the 'Actions' tab of the pmartR github repo or your fork if you ran it there.\n\n### pkgdown deploy site\nPull requests and pushes to branches specified in .github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml will trigger a build of a web page containing function documentation and rendered vignettes.  This requires obviously that your vignettes build without error, and that your documentation is valid.  The site will **deploy** only when we do a release on github.\n\n## Documentation and tests\n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n*  Vignettes should be put under `/vignettes` and should be written in `Rmarkdown`.\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n"

See these posts that try to explain the issue:  [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64992467/mac-clang-installation-seems-to-override-gcc-install) [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29992066/rcpp-warning-directory-not-found-for-option-l-usr-local-cellar-gfortran-4-8/29993906#29993906) [3](https://forum.posit.co/t/setting-up-travis-ci-on-linux-with-an-r-package-that-uses-rcpparmadillo/53910/3).  The simplest solution if you are on Mac/Windows and have a recent R version is to install from pre-built binaries (see installation section).  If you cannot install from binaries, two solutions we have found are:\n\n1.  Install gfortran from a recommended source (not homebrew): \n    - [This CRAN-approved resource for build tools on mac](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/) lists two versions of gfortran and how to install them.\n    - On Catalina 10.15.7 I downloaded and installed gfortran 8.2 from the link provided in [this blog post](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/#google_vignette)  \n2.  When using the homebrew gfortran installation, add the line **FLIBS = -L\\`gfortran -print-file-name=libgfortran.dylib | xargs dirname\\`** to ~/.R/Makevars (a plain text file with no extention)\n"

See the [updated \"Statistical Analysis with the pmartR Package\" article.](https://pmartr.github.io/pmartR/articles/Statistical_Analysis_with_pmartR.html)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed `imd_anova` not handling imbalanced covariates correctly #290 \r\n- The proteomics filter now has an order to it:  First the degenerate peptides are removed, then proteins without `min_num_peps` peptides mapping to them are removed.  This matters since the removal of degenerate peptides may affect which proteins pass the `min_num_peps` threshold. #291\r\n- Fixed G-test heatmap plot (option `plot_type = 'gheatmap'` in `plot.statRes`) incorrectly ordering axes. #289 \r\n- Fixed problem with volcano plots #285 \r\n- Various fixes to trelliscope functionality #284 \r\n- Fix sample id issue with `plot.dimRes` #280 ",
