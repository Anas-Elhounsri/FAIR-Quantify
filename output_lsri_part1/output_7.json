It takes 10 minutes and you are done!\n\n**If you just want to use PTXQC (and maybe even modify) it:**\n\n*First*, install [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases) (see bottom of linked page). Pandoc is required in order to locally build the package vignettes (documentation),\nbut you can also read the [vignettes][Ref_Vign] online from the PTXQC GitHub page. More importantly, Pandoc enables PTXQC to write QC reports in HTML format (which come\nwith a help text for each plot and are interactive). PDF reports only contain plots!\nThe reports are printed as PDF by default and additionally as HTML if Pandoc is found.\n**If you install Pandoc later while your R session is already open, you need to close and re-open R in order to make R aware of Pandoc!**\n   \nYou can grab PTXQC from either [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PTXQC) *or* [GitHub](https://github.com/cbielow/PTXQC#installation).\nGitHub installation will give you the latest package; the CRAN version might be a little older, but is faster to install. Check the [NEWS][News_File] file for CRAN submissions and version.\n> For the code blocks below: Run **each line** separately in your R console, i.e. do not copy and paste the whole block.\n> If an error should occur, this allows to track it down more easily. See [FAQ - Installation][Ref_VignFAQ]\n> how to resolve them.\n\n    ## CRAN\n    install.packages(\"PTXQC\")\nor\n\n    ## GitHub\n    if (!require(devtools, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(\"devtools\")\n    library(\"devtools\")             ## this might give a warning like 'WARNING: Rtools is required ...'.
