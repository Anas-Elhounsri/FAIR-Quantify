Markers are separated by ';', values in brackets represent the quality call from Mykrobe, followed by the read depth at the alternate / reference alleles. The lowest read support amongst these markers is reported in the previous column.\n  * In the example table above, lineage3.6.1.1.2 (0.5, 84/22) is a poorly supported marker for sampleC. The lineage3.6.1.1.2 marker has a Mykrobe quality of 0.5, with a read depth at the marker locus of 84 for the marker allele vs 22 for the reference (wild-type) allele. If no read depth is indicated and only (0) is printed after the marker, this indicates that no kmers matching the marker locus were found in the genome.\n* **max support for additional markers**: For any markers detected that are incongruent with the finall genotype call, this column reports the percentage of reads supporting the marker allele at the best supported additional marker.\n  * In the example above, sample sampleB is being called as genotype 3.6.1.1 - compatible markers supporting this are 3, 3.6, 3.6.1, 3.6.1.1. However Mykrobe also detected an additional marker (3.7.20, details reported in the 'additional markers' column), with 0.9% read support.\n* **additional markers**: Lists any markers that are incongruent with the final genotype call. Markers are separated by ';', and the format is identical to column _poorly supported markers_. The highest read support for any such marker is reported in the previous column.\n  * For sampleB, Mykrobe has detected a lineage3.7.20 marker, with quality 0.5. The number of reads matching the marker allele is 1, vs 105 reads matching the reference allele, hence reported as \"lineage3.7.20 (0.5, 1/105)\".\n* **node support**: A list of all markers in the final genotype call with their Mykrobe quality calls (1, 0.5, or 0) and the read depths at the marker allele / reference allele (as per _poorly supported markers_ and _additional markers_). Note there is no marker for lineage5.1, as all lineage 5 strains cluster into the same clade (5.1), therefore full support for genotype 5.1.1 = markers for lineage5 and lineage5.1.1.\n"

Therefore if you see anything reported in the \"additional markers\" column, it is worth investigating further whether you have contaminated sequence data (which would produce low-quality calls with low read support at additional markers) or a genuine recombination (with would produce high-quality calls with high read support at additional markers). In such cases it may also be illuminating to investigate the Mykrobe output file for further information, details of the JSON output can be found in the [Mykrobe documentation here](https://github.com/Mykrobe-tools/mykrobe/wiki/AMR-prediction-output#json-file).\n"
