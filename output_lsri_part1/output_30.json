        "value": "This tool requires a CSV-file containing multiple observed cross-linking interactions. Two columns have to contain \nuniprot ids for each interacting residue, two columns have the observed peptides for each interacting residue\nand two columns the crosslinked residue's position within the full sequence (alternative: fill these \nwith Nans, but add two columns with the residue's positions in the respective peptides).\n1. The input file should then be specified as such with the \"-i / --input-filepath\"-parameter.\n2. If you intend to run CLAUDIO on separate datasets simultaneously, or want to split your dataset into smaller ones,\nyou have to specify the parameter \"-it / --input-temppath\". CLAUDIO generates multiple temporary files during its\ncomputation, most of which are in- or outputs of the third-party tools used. If parallel executions of CLAUDIO are run\nwith the same tempfile path, conflicts may be caused disrupting or falsifying some results. Thereby make sure to specify\ndifferent paths here, if you run the tool in parallel.\n3. It is important to customize the parameter \"-p / --projections\". This parameter requires a comma separated list\nas input, which maps the column names of your dataset to the ones used in the tool.\n4. You need to specify the paths to the local external tool installations (BLASTP and TopoLink).\nThe parameters for this are \"-bl / --blast-bin\" for the binary directory of blast, \"-bldb / --blast-db\" for the database\ndirectory containing the *pdbaa* database files, and \"-tl / --topolink-bin\" for the binary directory of TopoLink.\n5. Make sure you customize the settings pertaining the cross-linking experiments specifications, e.g. \n\"-x / --xl-residues\" for the aminoacids which may be cross-linked, and both \"-lmin / --linker-minimum\" and \n\"-lmax / --linker-maximum\" for the cross-linker's range capability. Besides this specify the amino acids the used cross-\nlinker is able to bind to. For this specify a tiny comma-separated list of possibly crosslinked residues, as \none-letter-code symbols. Optionally you may add two colon-symbols, if they wish to specify the position of the \nresidue in the sequence and/or the atom in the residue used for the distance computation. After the first colon-symbol \nthey may place the atom type for the distance computation, e.g. 'CB', 'CA', or 'N', etc. . If no value is set here 'CB'\nwill be used by default. After the second colon-symbol they may place one of three position values: 0 if the residue\nmay occur anywhere in the protein, 1 if the residue has to be at the N-terminus, or -1 if the residue has to be at the\nC-terminus (ex.: use \"K:CB:0\" to calculate the cross-link distance between lysin C-beta-atoms at any position in the\nchain). If you want to specify multiple possible positions for the same symbol you have to add them\nindividually (ex.: \"M::1,M::-1\" for methionine at either the beginning or end of the chain). By default, 0 is set here,\ne.g. the residue may be placed anywhere.\\\nNote: If the position or the atom type is specified there have to be two colon-symbols (ex.: \"K,M:1\" will not be\naccepted as input). You can leave the respective specification empty though, if you wish to use the default here (ex.:\n\"K::1\" is equal to \"K:CB:1\", \"M:N:0\" is equal to \"M:N:\", \"K:CB:0\" is equal to \"K::\" and also to just \"K\"). \nWith this the relevant settings are defined. You may choose to further specify the structure searche's settings in terms\nof coverage, sequence identity, and e-value, as well as the resolution cutoff during the structure selection, or even \nthe advanced settings. \nYou may see examples for all parameters in the [example configuration-file](https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/CLAUDIO/tree/main/config/config.txt),\nwhich also serves as an alternative to supply all parameter inputs. \n"
