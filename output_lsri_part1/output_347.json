But in some cases the constraints may be more relaxed for certain residues, in which case one needs to also search for mutated versions of the motif. pyScoMotif's `motif-search` command comes with this capability built-in.\n\nIn this section we showcase the search of the [alcohol dehydrogenase](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/m-csa/entry/256/) catalytic site, which can tolerate different mutations at different positions.\n\nThere are two options that control the search for mutated versions of a reference motif:\n- The `--residue_type_policy` option, for which there are 4 possibilities:\n    - \"strict\" (default): no mutations allowed, only search for motifs that have <ins>exactly</ins> the same residue types as the reference motif.\n    - \"relaxed\": residues can mutate according to their residue type group, which are: non-polar (GAVLI), polar (STPNQ), sulfur (MC), positives (KRH), negatives (DE), aromatic (FYW).\n    - \"fully_relaxed\": residues can be mutated to any of the other 19 possible residues.\n    - A custom position specific exchange in JSON format. This allows complete control over the possible mutations of each residue. The format takes residue IDs as keys and a string of possible mutations as values (e.g: '{\"A1\":\"KR\", \"A2\":\"YW\", \"A5\":\"D\"}'. Note the use of single and double quotes).\n\n- The `--max_n_mutated_residues` option, which controls the maximum number of combinations of mutations that should be allowed when generating mutated motifs. This option can be very useful if you want to search for similar motifs carrying multiple mutations. It is set to 1 by default.\n\nHere we use PDB 1hso and residues A46, A48, A51, A67 and A174 as our reference motif, and take advantage of the fully_relaxed option to search for all the possible mutated versions carrying 1 mutation, so our search command would be:\n\n```\npyscomotif motif-search --residue_type_policy=fully_relaxed --results_output_path=/home/user/Downloads/alcohol_dehydrogenase_pyScoMotif_result.csv --n_cores=6 /home/user/Downloads/UP000005640_9606_HUMAN_v3/pyScoMotif_index /home/user/Downloads/1hso.pdb A46 A48 A51 A67 A174\n```\n"
