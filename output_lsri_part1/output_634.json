It enables ROC curve-based statistics analysis for assessing the performance of methods in terms of AUC (area under ROC curve), partial AUCs, Youden's best p-value threshold, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, precision and recall. It is flexible to incorporate custom methods and currently integrates the state-of-the-art SPIA, ROntoTools (PE and pDIS), PADOG, GSA, GESA and SAFE. A benchmark dataset of mouse 10 KO GEO datasets is embedded for demo. The PathwayKO package provides a novel solution to the knock-out pathway enrichment analysis.\n \n"

[(here's how)](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#How-can-R-be-installed_003f).\n\nTo install this package from source code (and in this case, source code from Github), [devtools](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html) should be installed once R is in place. Also, you need to have [BiocManager](http://bioconductor.org/install/) installed so that all R package dependencies are kept consistent under BioConductor. PathwayKO was built under **R version 4.0.2** and **BioConductor version 3.11**, older versions of R and BioConductor may still work but were not tested.\n\nAfterwards having installed R and BioConductor, launch your R session, and use the following commands to install PathwayKO (\"**pathwayko**\" is the package name identifier used in R):\n\n```R\nlibrary(devtools)\n# If installing from Github\ndevtools::install_github(\"allenaigit/pathwayko\") \n```\n\nIf there is any missing dependencies, you will be prompted during installation and your installation may fail. Just update/install any missing packages following the prompt then try again. You may need more than one try to take care of all dependencies.\n\n**Note**: under \\*nix systems, default path for R package installation is \"/usr/local/lib/R\" which usually requires root access to write into it. Alternatively you can install packages under your home directory (e.g. \"\\~/R/\"), which makes such packages only available to you and not other users.\n"
