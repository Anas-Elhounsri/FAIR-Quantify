        "value": "TALAIA can be used for MD trajectories aswell. To exemplify how to do it we are going to use a trajectory where [insulin is interacting with oxaliplatin](https://doi.org/10.1039/c8mt00341f). Due to this interaction one of the disulphide bridges of the insulin is broken, thus allowing structural changes to the protein structure. With TALAIA we can visualize the forces driving the conformational change along the trajectory. \nTo use TALAIA for MD trajectories: \n- Load the trajectory selecting the specific format you are using. In this example we have a prmtop and a dcd files. \nIn this example, as the trajectory moves forward we will see represented the residues near the ligand at each frame. We will be able to identify interatctions between the ligand and the protein and their evolution through time. \nAs the trajectory advances we can see how the apolar moiety of oxaliplatin tends to establish hydrophobic interactions with non-polar residues by exposing the hydrophobic core of the insulin. \n"

You need UCSF Chimera installed if not download it from https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html. \nIf it is your first time using UCSF Chimera you can find information here: https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/Outreach/Tutorials/GettingStarted.html. There is also plenty of tutorials.\n\nBeware, that TALAIA has been developed under UCSF Chimera (which stands on Python 2). Deployments for ChimeraX (Python 3) are not yet finalized.\n\n2. Download TALAIA from the insilichem's Github repository. You can either clone it or download it as ZIP.\n\n![install_download_talaia_fro github_marcat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63212606/234835874-5e6f2524-4ad3-41fb-ae4e-2794bbbf46a4.png)\n\n\n3. To install TALAIA for the first time, open UCSF Chimera and go to the menu Favorites -> Add to Favorites/Toolbar...\n![menu_favourites](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63212606/234820955-c83f2c35-323d-4cec-b83c-eda7264dc63e.PNG)\n\n4. Add a new third-party plugin location. Here you have to make sure to select the directory where Talaia's directory is located (not the contents of the directory themselves). Save.\n\n![install_add_location_marcat_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63212606/234833893-e21aafaa-caad-4f70-8db9-de7b057933d6.PNG)\n\n5. As TALAIA only works through command line, you will need to activate it if it does not appear at the bottom of the Chimera window. In order to do so you have to go to Favorites -> Command line.\n![install_step5_command_line](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63212606/234821003-8ff69e87-90b1-4834-b593-8617575e319b.PNG)\n\nNow you are ready to use TALAIA!\n"

Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA \u201cCombined Work\u201d is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user\u2019s computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\n    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n"
