        "value": "An R package for the tidy-ing, post processing and analysis of quantitative proteomic data. \nProteomics analysis software, available either through a paid subscription or as an open-source tool, fail to output data in a well conceived tidy format. A majority of these tools generate output formats that have either mixed wide- and long-format data structures, columns headers with messy names and added symbols, and often confusing variable names. This leads researchers to create one-off scripts for cleaning and importing data from various formats, often creating an environment of unmaintained, bespoke code. This package attempts to solve that problem by creating a flexible import tool to unify multiple formats and create an new tidy R object for proteomics analysis. \nThis package supports at a high level: \n-   data importing\n-   data filtering\n-   data visualization\n-   quantitative normalization & imputation\n-   two-sample expression & term enrichment analysis\n-   protein inference, sequence coverage and visualization\n \n"

All of the effort of standardizing the variable names in the tidyproteomics data object is done upfront when importing the data. See `vignette(\"importing\")`. \nThis package divides data into tables similar to those in SQL, making it easy to organize and analyze data. This table structure offers a convenient way to explore relationships between different variables and to filter data according to specific criteria.\n \n"
