BayesKAT can implement a kernel-based association test that automatically selects the optimum kernel using the Bayesian approach and returns an interpretable result by incorporating prior knowledge based on biological experiments or known biological mechanisms.   \n"

        "value": "Multiple genetic variants often regulate complex diseases or phenotypes. In that case, an individual variant might be weakly associated with a phenotype, but a group of SNPs with a weak marginal signal might jointly regulate some crucial biological process. In that situation, set-based tests using the kernel-based testing (KBT) framework have proven helpful in practice. KBT framework jointly models the group effect of genetic variants controlling for other demographic covariate effects on a phenotype. It measures the similarity between genetic variants through a kernel function and then compares it with the phenotype similarity. Generally, a specific kernel function would be optimum for specific association types between the genetic variants and the phenotype. However, knowing the true functional relationship between the variants and phenotype is impossible, so choosing the optimum kernel beforehand is also tricky. Our method, \"BayesKAT,\" overcomes this kernel specification issue by selecting the optimum kernel based on the dataset while testing for the association. There are two alternative strategies (BayesKAT-MCMC and BayesKAT-MAP) to implement the BayesKAT methodology. BayesKAT-MCMC is a MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) sampling-based strategy and BayesKAT-MAP is a more flexible and fast optimization based strategy. Here we provide the code for each of the strategy as functions which takes input datasets and return the posterior probability of association. \n"

But  If the genotype data is available in PED format, which is common, code available in Create_genotype_matrix.R can be used to convert it to genotype matrix and save it in .csv format. Also, given a genotype data and a set of specified group of SNPs, user can create the appropriate genotype matrix Z using the fn_Z() function.  \n\nNote 2: If the genotype matrix Z has a small number of missing values, the fn_impute() function can be used for imputation. \n"
