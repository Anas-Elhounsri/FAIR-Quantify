DandD can be used to addresses how much new sequence is gained when a sequence collection grows and describe how much structural variation is discovered in each new human genome assembly allowing prediction of when discoveries will level off in the future. DandD uses a measure called $\\delta$ (\u201cdelta\u201d), developed initially for data compression and chiefly dependent on k-mer counts. DandD rapidly estimates $\\delta$ using genomic sketches. Further information about the use of delta to address sequence similarity and how it is implemented in DandD can be found in the associated publication in iScience Volume 27, Issue 3, 15 March 2024, 109054. \n"

(Meaning that cardinalities and pathing information will not be saved if DandD is terminated prematurely.)  \n`--safe`: Double check all sketch hashes to make sure they match the sums of the fasta hashes. This is time consuming, but is recommended if you have any suspicion that the fasta files have changed.  \n`--verbose`: Un-supress messages from DandD about progress.

It creates a pickle with the structure DandD will expect to receive for the other commands in order to answer questions downstream. It **requires** either a file containing full filepaths to fastas (`--fastas <path>`, `-f <path>`) or a data directory (`--datadir <path>`) containing all fastas of interest.  \n`--outdir <path>` or `-o <path>` : output directory (default current working directory)  \n`--sketchdir <sketchdb path>` or `-c <sketchdb path>` : path to sketch directory. If the sketches for `tree` already exist in a `sketchdb` directory other than inside `outdir`, the `sketchdir` can be provided in order to take maximum advantage of previous work in terms of time/space. This is especially important for the sketches in `sketchdb/ngen1` which take the most time and space when using Dashing.  \nAdditionally:  \n`-s <string>` or `--tag <string>` : string used in file name prefixes to name the non-sketch output files for a particular experiment. If no tag is provided, `\"dandd\"` will be used by default.  \n`-k <int>` : set the starting value in search for optimal `k` for delta. As demonstrated in the DandD paper, the optimal k-mer length for delta changes based on characteristics of the data. Therefore, it is beneficial to adjust the starting value of k based on prior information to avoid searching excessively high or low values.  \n`--exact` : use KMC for k-mer counting (instead of estimation through Dashing sketching) to calculate delta.   \n`--non-canon` : disable canonicalization. By default, DandD will canonicalize the k-mers (i.e. treat reverse complements as equivalent to the original k-mer string).  \n`--nchildren <int>` or `-n <int>` : maximum number of children for each union. By default, DandD will build trees with a single layer of child nodes and one single union of all inputs (nicknamed 'spiders'). With `--nchildren` the tree can be built by calculating delta for a series of smaller unions by indicating the maximum number of children for each union.  \n`--registers <int>` : adjust number of registers used during sketching. For information about the implementation and trade-offs of adjusting this value, see Dashing's documentation.  \n`--lowmem` : delete union sketches/databases after storing their cardinalities and use stored values even when the sketch is missing. The path information etc. for the sketch will remain stored in the internal files such as dandd_fastahex and dandd_sketchinfo as well as the sketchdb.txt for the experiment.  **Note:** It is not recommended to use this command the first time the databases are initialized.   \n"

If you want to sweep higher `k`s, you must use KMC via the `--exact` flag. If `--ksweep` is set, the progressive output will not seek or produce the delta values for each union, but instead provide the *possible delta* values (output field: delta_pos) for each union at each specified k in the range. \n#### Result Files\nResult files are named using a **prefix** composed of: the provided `tag` string, the total number of fasta files used to produce them, progu<the number of orderings (from `--norder` or zero if entirety of default ordering file is used)>, and the `tool` used (kmc or dashing).  \n**<prefix>.csv**  \nIf `--ksweep` is **not** included, this file will contain the `progressive` outputs of the deltas for the component fastas for each union in each ordering permutation.
