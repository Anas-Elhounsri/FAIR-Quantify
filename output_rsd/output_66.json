See also the [installation notes](https://github.com/dalesteam/dales/wiki/Installation-notes) in the DALES wiki for further notes on specific systems.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n------------\n\nDependencies of DALES are\n1) MPI \n2) NetCDF (optional)\n3) CMake\n4) FFTW version 3.x (optional) \n5) HYPRE (optional) for the iterative Poisson solver.\n6) Doxygen, DOT and LaTeX for building the documentation\n\nCompiling\n---------\n\nPackages are available at <https://github.com/dalesteam/dales>\nIf git is installed, the best way to obtain DALES is with:\n\n`git clone https://github.com/dalesteam/dales.git`\nFor updates you can then just use the command \n```\ngit pull origin master\n```\n\nThen follow the following instructions:\n```\ncd dales \n# git checkout <branch>  optionally switch to another branch\nmkdir build \ncd build \ncmake ..\nmake\n# make install # optional\n```\nThis should provide the dales4 binary in the build/src directory. New builds can be made by `make` in the build directory. The documentation is built by typing `make docs` in the build directory.\n\nCompiling with HYPRE or FFTW\n----------------------------\n\nTo compile DALES with support for HYPRE and/or FFTW, add the following flags on the cmake command line.\nFor HYPRE:\n```\ncmake .. -DUSE_HYPRE=True -DHYPRE_LIB=path-to-libHYPRE.so\n```\nwhere -DHYPRE_LIB is needed if the library is not automatically found.\nFor FFTW:\n```\ncmake .. -DUSE_FFTW=True -DFFTW_LIB=path-to-libfftw3.so\n```\nwhere the path again is needed only if the library is not automatically found.\n\nEven when compiled with these libraries, DALES will use the traditional FFT-based Poisson solver unless\none of the alternatives are specified in the namelist, e.g. to use FFTW:\n\n```\n&SOLVER\nsolver_id = 100\n/\n```\nSee the [Wiki](https://github.com/dalesteam/dales/wiki/Alternative-Poisson-solvers) for the options for the iterative solver.\n\nOptimization and tuning\n-----------------------\n\nBefore `cmake`, one can execute\n```\nexport SYST=gnu-fast\n```\nwhich triggers compilation with more aggressive optimization options, in particular `-Ofast` and `-march=native`. Other pre-defined sets of compilation options are included in the file `CMakeLists.txt`.\n\nChoosing debug or release builds\n--------------------------------\n\nOne can change between release and debug options by invoking commandline options of cmake:\n```\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=\"DEBUG\" ..\n```\nor `\"RELEASE\"`, if that is the build-type desired.  `\"RELEASE\"` is the default.\nVarious case specific routines can be found in de dales/case/<casename> and are built by invoking\n```\ncmake -DCASE=\"<casename>\"\n```\nwhere `<casename>` could be something like \"rico\". Regardless of the case built, the standard DALES runs are always possible (and default).\n\n\n\n\n\n"
