Based on this domain model and a specification of the available workflow inputs, the intended workflow outputs and possibly additional constraints, APE then computes possible workflows.\n\n  Internally, APE uses a component-based program synthesis approach. It translates the domain knowledge and workflow specification into logical formulas that are then fed to a SAT solver to compute satisfying instances. These solutions are then translated into the actual candidate workflows.\nkeywords:\n  - automated workflow composition\n  - workflow synthesis\nlicense: Apache-2.0\ncommit: 8d13cb975dacf7e757cd5faf2276449bea16f93c\nversion: 2.2.0\ndate-released: '2023-11-14'\n"
