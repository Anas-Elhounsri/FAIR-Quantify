To not split requests by year, add `--splitmonths False`.\r\n\r\n**Fixed:**\r\n\r\n - Added support for the beta-CDS\r\n - For authentication, the new `cads-api-client` is used, instead of a dummy request. This should avoid the dummy requests appearing in the user's queue.\r\n\r\n**Removed:**\r\n\r\n - the deprecated `orography` variable. Use `geopotential` instead.\r\n - the deprecated `--prelimbe` argument. This one has not been required anymore, as the back-extension is part of the normal dataset now.\r\n\r\n**Dev changes:**\r\n\r\n - The pre-commit hook has been removed. Pre-commit does not play well with hatch: it would need to be installed system-wide. No hatch-specific hooks are available.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "With this `era5cli` release comes a new documentation and some quality-of-life improvements!\r\nFor details see the lists below:\r\n\r\n**Added:**\r\n\r\n - Add validator for user's CDS keys. This should provide better feedback to users and reduce user error ([#138](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/138)).\r\n - Added `--splitmonths` argument for `era5cli hourly`. This allows users to avoid a Request Too Large error ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).\r\n - When a request would encounter a Request Too Large error in the CDS API, they are warned, and given a suggestion to use the new `--splitmonths` argument ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).\r\n - Added -`-dashed-varname` argument, to produce file names where the variable name is separated using dashes. For example: `soil-type` vs. `soil_type`. For the ongoing discussion, see [#53](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/issues/53).\r\n\r\n**Changed:**\r\n\r\n - Change CDS keys from cdsapi default `.cdsapirc` file to `.config/era5cli/cds_key.txt` file ([#138](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/138)).\r\n   - This will avoid conflict with e.g. ADS keys\r\n   - The user can configure the keys using `era5cli config`, no need to create a file in the right location.\r\n - When a request would encounter a Request Too Large error in the CDS API, they are warned, and given a suggestion to use `--splitmonths` ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).\r\n - If a user makes a request without `--splitmonths` they are warned that the behavior will change in the future, and that they have to choose between `--splitmonths False` and `--splitmonths True`\r\n - When a file already exists and would be overwritten, the user is prompted for confirmation. This should prevent accidental overwriting of files. This check can be skipped with the `--overwrite` flag ([#143](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/143)).\r\n - The earliest valid start year of ERA5 requests has been updated to 1940 (for ERA5-land it is still 1950) ([#146](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/146)).\r\n - Usage of `--prelimbe` now raises a deprecation warning. It will be deprecated in a future release, as all the back extension years are now included in the main products ([#147](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/147)).\r\n - The documentation has been fully overhauled, and now uses Markdown files & MkDocs ([#142](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/142), [#144](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/144)).\r\n\r\n**Dev changes:**\r\n\r\n - `cli.py` has been refactored to make the structure more clear. Seperate argument builders are now in their own modules ([#139](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/era5cli/pull/139)).",
