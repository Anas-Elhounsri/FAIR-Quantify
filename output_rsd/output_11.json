        "description": "Parcels v3.0.0 is a major update to v2.4.2. The most important change is that the kernel loop has been changed, to support vectorial summing of particle displacements, in #1402.

Parcels has a parallel MPI version! While working on multiple processors, the particles are spread over the processors for an efficient integration. (#625). See https://oceanparcels.org#parallel_install for instructions on how to install.\r\n2. For an efficient loading of the `Fieldset`, the `Field` objects are now loaded by chunks, controlled by the parameter `field_chunksize` (#632). This results in lower memory usage and faster simulation. It is also a fundamental part of the parallel implementation, since for low number of particles per processor, the computation time is dominated by the loading of the data. A more efficient parallel version will be dynamically balancing the particles between the processors such to minimise the number of chunks loaded per processor. See [this document](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/parcels/examples/documentation_MPI.ipynb) for further background on the implementation.\r\n3. An efficient writing of the particleset. For a quicker export of the data, particles are now dumped into npy files during simulation. The pickles are gathered into one single file at the end of the simulation.  (#614)\r\n4. A proper management of `particle.dt` modified by the kernel. If the kernel modifies `particle.dt`, the kernel will automatically be restarted with the updated `dt`. If you want to simply updates the `dt` for next kernel call, use `particle.update_next_dt(new_dt)`. (#657)\r\n5. New particles can now be added to the `ParticleSet` only via a temporary `ParticleSet` object. This enables a proper control of the `particle.id` in parallel (#629)\r\n6. `Field.gradient()` function is not available anymore. This functionality was providing spurious results on curvilinear grids and was conflicting with the use of chunked fields. Users can still obtain easily an accurate field gradient (see example proposed in #633) \r\n7. Using the `time_periodic` flag in `FieldSet` creation now requires the length of the period (#659)\r\n8. Numerous bug fixes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that Parcels v2.1.1 is the last version to officially support Python 2.7. While all functionalities currently work with both Python 2 and 3, new development and code dependencies will progressively lead to incompatibility with Python 2. We strongly advice the users to switch to Python 3.",

        "description": "Parcels v2.1.0 builds on previous versions v2.0.0. The major changes of v2.1.0 are:\r\n\r\n1. Parcels has a parallel MPI version! While working on multiple processors, the particles are spread over the processors for an efficient integration. (#625). See https://oceanparcels.org#parallel_install for instructions on how to install.\r\n2. For an efficient loading of the `Fieldset`, the `Field` objects are now loaded by chunks, controlled by the parameter `field_chunksize` (#632). This results in lower memory usage and faster simulation. It is also a fundamental part of the parallel implementation, since for low number of particles per processor, the computation time is dominated by the loading of the data. A more efficient parallel version will be dynamically balancing the particles between the processors such to minimise the number of chunks loaded per processor. See [this document](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/OceanParcels/parcels/blob/master/parcels/examples/documentation_MPI.ipynb) for further background on the implementation.\r\n3. An efficient writing of the particleset. For a quicker export of the data, particles are now dumped into npy files during simulation. The pickles are gathered into one single file at the end of the simulation.  (#614)\r\n4. A proper management of `particle.dt` modified by the kernel. If the kernel modifies `particle.dt`, the kernel will automatically be restarted with the updated `dt`. If you want to simply updates the `dt` for next kernel call, use `particle.update_next_dt(new_dt)`. (#657)\r\n5. New particles can now be added to the `ParticleSet` only via a temporary `ParticleSet` object. This enables a proper control of the `particle.id` in parallel (#629)\r\n6. `Field.gradient()` function is not available anymore. This functionality was providing spurious results on curvilinear grids and was conflicting with the use of chunked fields. Users can still obtain easily an accurate field gradient (see example proposed in #633) \r\n7. Using the `time_periodic` flag in `FieldSet` creation now requires the length of the period (#659)\r\n8. Numerous bug fixes\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that Parcels v2.1.0 is the last version to officially support Python 2.7. While all functionalities currently work with both Python 2 and 3, new development and code dependencies will progressively lead to incompatibility with Python 2. We strongly advice the users to switch to Python 3.",

        "description": "Parcels v1.1.1 builds on the previous v1.1.0 release. Major changes since then:\r\n\r\n- In `Fieldset.from_netcdf()`, the format of `filenames` argument has been enriched (#463). \r\n  As before, `filenames` can be:\r\n  - list of files\r\n  - dictionaries of list of files, where the dictionary keys are field names\r\n\r\n  On top of that, `filenames` can now be:\r\n  - dictionaries of lists of files, where the dictionary keys are dimension names: `filenames[dimension_name] = [files]`\r\n  - dictionaries of dictionaries of lists of files: `filenames[field_name][dimension_name] = [files]`\r\n  \r\n  This particularly affects the function `Fieldset.from_nemo()`:\r\n  \r\n  New `filenames` looks like:\r\n  ```\r\n  filenames = {'U': {'lon': data_path + 'mesh_mask.nc4',\r\n                     'lat': data_path + 'mesh_mask.nc4',\r\n                     'data': data_path + 'U_purely_zonal-ORCA025_grid_U.nc4'},\r\n               'V': {'lon': data_path + 'mesh_mask.nc4',\r\n                     'lat': data_path + 'mesh_mask.nc4',\r\n                     'data': data_path + 'V_purely_zonal-ORCA025_grid_V.nc4'}}\r\n  ```\r\n  instead of:\r\n  \r\n  ```\r\n  filenames = {'U': data_path + 'U_purely_zonal-ORCA025_grid_U.nc4',\r\n               'V': data_path + 'V_purely_zonal-ORCA025_grid_V.nc4',\r\n               'mesh_mask': data_path + 'mesh_mask.nc4'}\r\n  ```\r\n  This modification enables to easily read 3d curvilinear NEMO fields, when the depth dimension is in the data-files.\r\n\r\n- A new `TimeConverter` class converts between dates and the number of seconds that Parcels uses under the hood. This enables to read netcdf files with less common time formats, such as NOLEAP. (#456)\r\n- New `netcdf_engine` as argument for `Fieldset.from_netcdf()`, enables to open netcdf files with a different engine when the default netcdf4 engine does not work. (#460)\r\n- Improved error messages for C-kernel generator (#457)\r\n- Minor bug fixes\r\n\r\nNote that it is now recommended to use a recent version of xarray (>=0.10.8) together with Parcels, since it better parses some netcdf files used by common OGCMs.\r\n",

        "description": "Parcels v1.0.2 builds on the previous v1.0.1 release. Major changes since then:\r\n- Parcels is now also Python3-compatible\r\n- No need anymore for `FieldSet.advancetime()`, as advancing of time for large datasets is now dealt with under the hood. For datasets that have more than 3 time snapshots, Parcels runs in 'defer_load' mode, where the actual reading of NetCDF files is only performed when required. This means that longer lists of filenames in `FieldSet.from_netcdf()` (and `FieldSet.from_nemo()`) don't require more memory. If you still require the entire dataset to be loaded in one go, you can use `full_load=True` as an option to `FieldSet.from_netcdf()`.\r\n- The`ParticleFile` class now always writes particle data in `array` format. See also http://oceanparcels.org/faq.html#outputformat\r\n- The website has been revamped at http://oceanparcels.org, with repository at https://github.com/OceanParcels/oceanparcels_website",
