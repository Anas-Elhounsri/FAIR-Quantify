Install the Tizen extensions for native development for version 2.3.1 (tab: Main SDK)\n3. Install the Tizen extension for Certificates (tab: Extension SDK)\n4. Make a Samsung developer account: https://developer.samsung.com/sa/signIn.do\n5. Run package manager (Tizen Studio -> tools), go through the wizard steps.\n6. Set up the Mobile hotspot of Windows (part of Network & Internet settings), switch Wifi on.\n7. Take a Watch, put it in debug mode, switch on Wifi and connect to the Hotspot (pass word is shown).\n8. Run device manager (Tizen Studio -> tools), press middle button on right top (\"remote device manager\"\"), add a watch to the list (plus sign). You can either add the info manually or use a button to \"scan\" for devices. Switch connection to \"on\". If a watch is connected for the first time: confirm connection on the watch, too. \n9. After a while the device manager tool shows connection activity.\n\nNotes:\nInstallation guide of the Tizen Studio development environment can be found in https://developer.samsung.com/tizen/Galaxy-Watch/certificate/creating-certificate.html and then hover up to > installation.\n\nTip Windows Installations: \nIn case you cannot run the Device Manager and get a message that msvcr120dll is missing, you will have to load an extension for your OS:\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/msvcr120dll-is-missing-or-error/aafe820f-4dbb-4043-aba2-e4ac2dcf69c1\n\nIn case you cannot run the Device Manager and get a message that msvcp120dll is missing, you will have to load an extension for your OS:\nhttps://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/missing-msvcp120dll-file/f0a14d55-73f0-4a21-879e-1cbacf05e906\n\nThe watches have version 2.3.1:13 of the Tizen OS, so choose to install the 2.3.1 SDK together with the certificate SDK.\n"

Download from the main branch the software project sensor application and sensor service. Click on \"code\" and download zip file.\n4. Open the project files one by one with the Tizen Studio 4.1\n5. Open the device manager, make connection to the watch (step 8 + 9 of installation Tizen Studio environment).\nFor the next steps, you will need to get certificates to run the app on the watches. Check \"Certificates\" for more information. \n6. Select the sensor application project, click on the right button of your mouse, choose run-as, choose native device. The software is now downloaded to the watch.\n7. Select the sensor service project, click on the right button of your mouse, choose run-as, choose native device.\n8. The sensor application is found at the bottom of all applications.\n9. Put watch in debug mode, switch all app off with settings only switch on wifi.\n10. Push - with the device manager - a configuration file with name \"configuration.dat\" on folder \"/opt/var/tmp/\".\nNotes about the configuration file: \nWrite timer can be set to a higher frequency than the data is collected to miss fewer signals\nThe privacy circle has a max range of 10000 mt, anything higher sets the privacy circle to 100 mt\n11. Do a zero measurement (for calibration offline) for 15 minutes, upload the sensor + con files.\n\nNOTE: You can also use the sdb (Smart Development Bridge) tool which come with Tizen Studio instead of the Device Manager. See the HOW-TO-USE-SDB.md.\n"

Click on the RESTART button.\n7. Put the watch around the wrist / upper arm / ankle of the patient.\n8. Write down watch identifier (last 4 characters name of watch in Mobile hotspot, see picture below), patient identifier, date + time in Excel (shadow administration).\n9. After 3 hours / 15 hours collect the watch and put another watch around the wrist of the patient which went through step 1-6.\n10. Switch the collected watch off (power off) and charge to 100% (so charging time is very low).\n11. After battery 100%, switch on the watch and wifi to make connection with the laptop.\n12. Pull the sensor files (aag + bar + gps) and con file to the laptop from \"/opt/usr/apps/liacs.sensorservice/data/\". This can be done with the Device Manager but better with the sdb tool (see HOW-TO-USE-SDB.md).\n13. Remove the sensor- and con files from the watch if it exceeds 500 MB by pressing the CLEAN button 3x (sensor app).\n14. Switch the wifi off and continu with step 2. \n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37830964/117474773-931d7c80-af5b-11eb-9624-5701e7d59c19.png)\n"
