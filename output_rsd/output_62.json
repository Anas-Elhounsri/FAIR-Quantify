See the rest of this\n[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for different ways to help and details\nabout how this project handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant\nsection before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us\nmaintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks\nforward to your contributions. \ud83c\udf89\n\n> And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's\n> fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your\n> appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:\n>\n> - Star the project\n> - Tweet about it\n> - Refer this project in your project's readme\n> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [I Have a Question](#i-have-a-question)\n- [I Want To Contribute](#i-want-to-contribute)\n  - [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n  - [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)\n\n## I Have a Question\n\n> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available\n> [Documentation](https://astro-informatics.github.io/sleplet).\n\nBefore you ask a question, it is best to search for existing\n[Issues](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/issues) that might help\nyou. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you\ncan write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the\ninternet for answers first.\n\nIf you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we\nrecommend the following:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/issues/new).\n- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.\n- Provide project and platform versions (python etc.), depending on what seems\n  relevant.\n\nWe will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n## I Want To Contribute\n\n> ### Legal Notice\n>\n> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100%\n> of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the\n> content you contribute may be provided under the project licence.\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\n#### Before Submitting a Bug Report\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more\ninformation. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information\nand describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following\nsteps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using\n  incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the\n  [documentation](https://astro-informatics.github.io/sleplet). If you are\n  looking for support, you might want to check\n  [this section](#i-have-a-question)).\n- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the\n  same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing\n  for your bug or error in the\n  [bug tracker](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/issues?q=label%3Abug).\n- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if\n  users outside the GitHub community have discussed the issue.\n- Collect information about the bug:\n  - Stack trace (Traceback)\n  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)\n  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package\n    manager, depending on what seems relevant.\n  - Possibly your input and the output\n  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with\n    older versions?\n\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?\n\n> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs\n> including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.\n> Instead, sensitive bugs must be sent by email to\n> <patrickjamesroddy@gmail.com>.\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the\nproject:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/issues/new).\n  (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you\n  not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)\n- Explain the behaviour you would expect and the actual behaviour.\n- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction_\n  _steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This\n  usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the\n  problem and create a reduced test case.\n- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.\n\nOnce it's filed:\n\n- The project team will label the issue accordingly.\n- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If\n  there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the\n  team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs\n  with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.\n- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as\n  well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left\n  to be implemented by someone.\n\n### Suggesting Enhancements\n\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for\n`SLEPLET`, **including completely new features and minor improvements to\nexisting** **functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers\nand the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n\n#### Before Submitting an Enhancement\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Read the [documentation](https://astro-informatics.github.io/sleplet)\n  carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an\n  individual configuration.\n- Perform a [search](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/issues) to see\n  if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the\n  existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's\n  up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the\n  merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful\n  to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just\n  targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.\n\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?\n\nEnhancement suggestions are tracked as\n[GitHub issues](https://github.com/astro-informatics/sleplet/issues).\n\n- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the\n  suggestion.\n- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many\n  details as possible.\n- **Describe the current behaviour** and **explain which behaviour you\n  expected** **to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which\n  alternatives do not work for you.\n- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most `SLEPLET` users. You\n  may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which\n  could serve as inspiration.\n"
