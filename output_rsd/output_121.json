Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation);\n1. you want to make a new release of the code base.\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/AI4S2S/ai4s2s/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n3. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/AI4S2S/ai4s2s/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the SHA hashcode of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository;\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``hatch run test``;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with change;\n1. push your feature branch to (your fork of) the s2s repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request.\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n\n## You want to make a release\nThis section is for maintainers of the package.\n\n1. Checkout ``HEAD`` of ``main`` branch with ``git checkout main`` and ``git pull``.\n2. Determine what new version (major, minor or patch) to use. Package uses `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`.\n3. Run ``bump2version <major|minor|patch>`` to update version in package files.\n4. Update CHANGELOG.md with changes between current and new version.\n5. Make sure pre-commit hooks are green for all files by running ``pre-commit run --all-files``.\n6. Commit & push changes to GitHub.\n7. Wait for [GitHub\n    actions](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy/actions?query=branch%3Amain+)\n    to be completed and green.\n\n8. Create a [GitHub release](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy/releases/new)\n\n    - Use version as title and tag version.\n    - As description use intro text from README.md (to give context to\n        Zenodo record) and changes from CHANGELOG.md\n\n9. Create a PyPI release.\n\n    1. Create distribution archives with `hatch build`.\n    2. Upload archives to PyPI with `hatch publish` (use your\n        personal PyPI account).\n\n10. Verify\n\n    1. Has [new Zenodo record](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=s2spy) been created?\n    2. Has [stable](https://ai4s2s.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ReadTheDocs been updated?\n    3. Can new version be installed with pip using\n        `python3 -m pip install s2spy==<new version>`?\n\n11.

Currently, these data-driven S2S forecasts generally suffer from a lack of trust because of:\n- Intransparent data processing and poorly reproducible scientific outcomes\n- Technical pitfalls related to machine learning-based predictability (e.g. overfitting)\n- Black-box methods without sufficient explanation \nTo tackle these challenges, we build `s2spy` which is an open-source, high-level python package. It provides an interface between artificial intelligence and expert knowledge, to boost predictability and physical understanding of S2S processes. By implementing optimal data-handling and parallel-computing packages, it can efficiently run across different Big Climate Data platforms. Key components will be explainable AI and causal discovery, which will support the classical scientific interplay between theory, hypothesis-generation and data-driven hypothesis-testing, enabling knowledge-mining from data. \nDeveloping this tool will be a community effort. It helps us achieve trustworthy data-driven forecasts by providing:\n- Transparent and reproducible analyses\n- Best practices in model verifications\n- Understanding the sources of predictability\n \n"

Users now need to fully specify their RGDR setup ([#133](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy/pull/133)).\r\n- The RGDR visualization plots are now called using `RGDR.preview_correlation` and `RGDR.preview_clusters` ([#106](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy/pull/106)).\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- Calendar, resampling, and traintest modules have been moved to a separate package named [Lilio](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio) ([#158](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy/pull/158)).\r\n\r\n### Dev changes\r\n- Use `hatch` as the project manager, and `ruff` as the linter ([#159](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy/pull/159)).\r\n- Notebooks have been moved to the docs folder, to be included in ReadtheDocs in the future ([#159](https://github.com/AI4S2S/s2spy/pull/159)).\r\n",

For instance, a user is looking for predictors for winter climate at seasonal timescales (~180 days). First, a `Calendar` object is created using `daily_calendar`:\n\n```py\n>>> calendar = lilio.daily_calendar(anchor=\"11-30\", length='180d')\n>>> calendar = calendar.map_years(2020, 2021)\n>>> calendar.show()\ni_interval                         -1                         1\nanchor_year\n2021         [2021-06-03, 2021-11-30)  [2021-11-30, 2022-05-29)\n2020         [2020-06-03, 2020-11-30)  [2020-11-30, 2021-05-29)\n```\n\nNow, the user can load the data `input_data` (e.g. `pandas` `DataFrame`) and resample it to the desired timescales configured in the calendar:\n\n```py\n>>> calendar = calendar.map_to_data(input_data)\n>>> bins = lilio.resample(calendar, input_data)\n>>> bins\n  anchor_year  i_interval                  interval  mean_data  target\n0        2020          -1  [2020-06-03, 2020-11-30)      275.5    True\n1        2020           1  [2020-11-30, 2021-05-29)       95.5   False\n2        2021          -1  [2021-06-03, 2021-11-30)      640.5    True\n3        2021           1  [2021-11-30, 2022-05-29)      460.5   False\n```\n\nDepending on data preparations, we can choose different types of calendars.
