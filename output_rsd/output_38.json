Its goal is to make the capture and analysis of data\nfrom these platforms accessible to people through a web interface, without\nrequiring any programming or web scraping skills. Our target audience is\nresearchers, students and journalists interested using Digital Methods in their\nwork. \nIn 4CAT, you create a dataset from a given platform according to a given set of\nparameters; the result of this (usually a CSV or JSON file containing matching items)\ncan then be downloaded or analysed further with a suite of analytical\n'processors', which range from simple frequency charts to more advanced analyses\nsuch as the generation and visualisation of word embedding models. \n4CAT has a (growing) number of supported data sources corresponding to popular\nplatforms that are part of the tool, but you can also [add additional data\nsources](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/wiki/How-to-make-a-data-source)\nusing 4CAT's Python API. The following data sources are currently supported\nactively and can be used to collect data with 4CAT directly: \n* 4chan and 8kun\n* Telegram\n* Tumblr \nThe following platforms are supported through \n[Zeeschuimer](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/zeeschuimer), with \nwhich you can collect data to import into 4CAT for analysis: \n* Instagram (posts)\n* TikTok (posts and comments)\n* 9gag\n* Imgur\n* LinkedIn\n* Gab\n* Douyin\n* X/Twitter \nIt is also possible to upload data collected with other tools as CSV files. The\nfollowing tools are explicitly supported but other data can also be uploaded as\nlong as it is formatted as CSV: \nA number of other platforms have built-in support that is untested, or requires\ne.g. special API access. You can view the [data sources in our wiki](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/wiki/Available-data-sources) or review [the data\nsources' code](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/tree/master/datasources)\nin the GitHub repository.\n \n"

If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

We have updated 4CAT's dependency list to resolve this. Otherwise this release is identical to the previous one, save for this one additional feature:\r\n\r\n* Added a progress bar to the list of active workers on the control panel's front page for workers where progress information is available.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat/compare/v1.43...v1.44",

        "description": "This release of 4CAT fixes the following bugs that were introduced in the previous release, v1.34:\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue when upgrading from an older version where the datasets table would not correctly be upgraded to the new scheme\r\n* Fixed an issue where a dataset's parent key could be `NULL` or an empty string; it should now always be an empty string\r\n* Fixed an issue where filtering datasets by user would have no effect\r\n* Fixed an issue where datasets made with a filter processor would not have the same ownership as the original dataset\r\n* Fixed an issue where deleting a child dataset would redirect to the dataset overview page instead of the parent dataset result page\r\n* Fixed an issue where the CLIP image processor would not read the correct configuration values\r\n* Fixed permalinks to processor results\r\n* Fixed crash in the worker that deletes expired datasets and users\r\n* Fixed the link to Gephi Lite in network previews\r\n* Added POSTGRES_TAG to .env allowing users to choose which Postgres database image they wish to use. The Postgres 15 Docker image is incompatible with Postgres 14 and users may wish to set POSTGRES_TAG=14 to continue using version 14 or otherwise follow Postgres instructions on how to upgrade. This should not be an issue if you are upgrading 4CAT through the web interface.\r\n\r\nThis release changes the way dataset expiration works, to avoid situations where it is ambiguous whether a dataset should 'expire' and be deleted automatically. Expiration can now only be configured per data source, not globally. To make this easier controls have been added to the control panel to set expiration time for multiple data sources at once, and to 'keep' or 'expire' datasets in bulk.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f **If you are upgrading 4CAT and had datasets or data sources set to expire, 4CAT will automatically disable all expiration** \u26a0\ufe0f  to avoid datasets expiring inadvertently. Please inspect the relevant settings and adjust as needed after upgrading. You can find the controls at the 'Data sources' tab in the 4CAT settings and the 'Dataset bulk management' page, both in the control panel.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this release of 4CAT incorporates the following new features and fixes:\r\n* Added a page to the control panel that shows the latest 250 lines of the backend log files\r\n* Added a page to the control panel where datasets can be managed in bulk\r\n* Added a column `link_url` to the CSV export of LinkedIn datasets containing the link embedded in a post\r\n* Added a column `is_withheld` to the CSV export of Twitter datasets imported with Zeeschuimer indicating if a tweet was withheld (withheld tweets could previously crash data exports)\r\n* Added a user privilege which controls whether users can manipulate datasets they do not own (disabled by default, enabled for admins)\r\n* Added Explorer styling for Douyin datasets\r\n* Added a setting controlling how many images the PixPlot processor can process\r\n* Fixed an issue with the TikTok URLs downloader which would erroneously try to capture posts behind a login wall\r\n* Streamlined annotating data via the Explorer and subsequent usage of annotations\r\n* The co-link network processor will now no longer add redundant loops\r\n* The 'data sources' setting in the control panel is now easier to manipulate and has more explanatory information",
