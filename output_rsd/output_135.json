It is developed as a component of the FAIR Workbench, as part of the FAIR is FAIR project. The focus is on description of workflows consisting of manual and computational steps using semantic technology, such as the ontology described in the publication: Celebi, R., Moreira, J. R., Hassan, A. A., Ayyar, S., Ridder, L., Kuhn, T., & Dumontier, M. (2019). Towards FAIR protocols and workflows: The OpenPREDICT case study. arXiv:1911.09531. The goals of the project are: 1. To facilitate the construction of RDF descriptions of a variety of scientific 'workflows', in the most general sense. This includes experimental procedures, ipython notebooks, computational analysis of results, etc.  2. To allow validation and publication of the resultant RDF (for example, by means of nanopublications).  3. Re-use of previously published steps, in new workflows.  4. FAIR data flow from end-to-end.. The fairworkflows library seeks to provide an easy-to-use python interface for achieving these goals.\"\n\n\nauthors:\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Netherlands eScience Center\"\n    family-names: Richardson\n    given-names: Robin\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Netherlands eScience Center\"\n    family-names: Burg\n    given-names: Sven\n    name-particle: \"van der\"\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Netherlands eScience Center\"\n    family-names: Smits\n    given-names: Djura\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Maastricht University\"\n    family-names: Celebi\n    given-names: Remzi\n  -\n    affiliation: \"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\"\n    family-names: Kuhn\n    given-names: Tobias\ncff-version: \"1.0.3\"\nkeywords:\n  - \"semantic\"\n  - \"RDF\"\n  - \"FAIR\"\n  - \"workflows\"\n  - \"nanopublications\"\nlicense: \"Apache-2.0\"\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it using these metadata.\"\ntitle: \"fairworkflows: A python library for handling semantically described scientific workflows\"\nversion: \"0.3.0\"\n"

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation).\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/fair-workflows/fairworkflows/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n1. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/fair-workflows/fairworkflows/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community _before you start working_. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. install the dependencies required to run `fairworkflows` in development:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``pytest``. Note that any pull requests to the fairworkflows repository on github will automatically trigger running of the test suite;\n1. check that the code is in accordance with the PEP8 style guide, by running ``flake8 . --count --show-source --statistics``,\nconfiguration is in `tox.ini`.\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to (your fork of) the fairworkflows repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n"

To facilitate the construction of RDF descriptions of a variety of scientific 'workflows', in the most general sense. This includes experimental procedures, ipython notebooks, computational analysis of results, etc.\n2. To allow validation and publication of the resultant RDF (for example, by means of nanopublications).\n3. Re-use of previously published steps, in new workflows.\n4. FAIR data flow from end-to-end.\n\nWe seek to provide an easy-to-use python interface for achieving the above.\n\n## Documentation\nCheckout the [user documentation](https://fairworkflows.readthedocs.io/).\n\n## Installation\n\nThe most recent release can be installed from the python package index using ```pip```:\n\n```\npip install fairworkflows\n```\n\nTo publish workflows to the nanopub server you need to setup your nanopub profile. This\nallows the nanopub server to identify you. Run the following in the terminal after installation:\n```\nsetup_nanopub_profile\n```\nThis will add and store RSA keys to sign your nanopublications, publish a\nnanopublication with your name and ORCID iD to declare that you are\nusing using these RSA keys, and store your ORCID iD to automatically add\nas author to the provenance of any nanopublication you will publish\nusing this library.\n\n## Quick demo\nTry out the library in this online executable notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fair-workflows/fairworkflows/main?filepath=examples%2Ffairworkflows-quick-start.ipynb)\n\n## Quick Start\n### Import from `fairworkflows` library\n```python\nfrom fairworkflows import is_fairworkflow, is_fairstep, FairWorkflow\n```\n\n### Define a step for your workflow\nMark a function as a FAIR step using the `is_fairstep` decorator.\nUse keyword arguments to semantically annotate the step. \nIn this example to provide a label and describe that this is a script task.\n```python\n@is_fairstep(label='Addition', is_script_task=True)\ndef add(x: float, y: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Adding up numbers.\"\"\"\n    return x + y\n```\n### Define your workflow\nDefine your workflow by calling previously defined step functions. \nMark the function as a workflow using the `is_fairworkflow` decorator.\n```python\n@is_fairworkflow(label='My Workflow')\ndef my_workflow(in1, in2):\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple workflow\n    \"\"\"\n    t1 = add(in1, in2)\n    return t1\n```\n### Construct and publish a workflow\nConstruct a FairWorkflow object from the function defining the workflow and publish as nanopublication.\n```python\nworkflow = FairWorkflow.from_function(my_workflow)\nworkflow.publish_as_nanopub(use_test_server=True, publish_steps=True)\n```\n\n### Execute the workflow\nExecute the workflow and inspect the prospective provenance\n```python\nresult, prov = workflow.execute(1, 4)\nprint(prov)\n```\n\n### Example notebook\n* See [examples/fairworkflows-quick-start.ipynb](examples/fairworkflows-quick-start.ipynb) for a current example of using the fairworkflows library to build a workflow using plex rdf\n\n## How is the ```fairworkflows``` library expected to be used?\nWhile this library could be used as a standalone tool to build/publish RDF workflows,\nit is intended more as a component to be used in a variety of other tools that seek to add FAIR elements to workflows. At present the library is used in the following tools:\n\n* [FAIRWorkflowsExtension](https://github.com/fair-workflows/FAIRWorkflowsExtension): A Jupyter Lab extension that adds a widget for searching for previously published FairSteps or FairWorkflows. These can then be loaded into the notebook for modification or combination into new workflows.\n\nIt is expected that the library will soon interact with FAIR Data Points as well e.g. [fairdatapoint](https://github.com/NLeSC/fairdatapoint).\n\n## Relation to existing workflow formats/engines (e.g. CWL, WDL, Snakemake etc)\nThis library is not intended to replace or compete with the hundreds of existing computational workflow formats, but rather to aid in RDF description and comparison of workflows in the most general sense of the term (including manual experiemental steps, notebooks, and so on). Steps in a FAIRWorkflow may very well be 'run this CWL workflow' or 'run this script', so such workflows are expected to sit more on a meta-level, describing the before-and-after of running one of these fully automated computational workflows as well."

At present the library is used in the following tools:\n\n* [FAIRWorkflowsExtension](https://github.com/fair-workflows/FAIRWorkflowsExtension): A Jupyter Lab extension that adds a widget for searching for previously published FairSteps or FairWorkflows. These can then be loaded into the notebook for modification or combination into new workflows.\n\nIt is expected that the library will soon interact with FAIR Data Points as well e.g. [fairdatapoint](https://github.com/NLeSC/fairdatapoint).\n\n## Relation to existing workflow formats/engines (e.g. CWL, WDL, Snakemake etc)\nThis library is not intended to replace or compete with the hundreds of existing computational workflow formats, but rather to aid in RDF description and comparison of workflows in the most general sense of the term (including manual experiemental steps, notebooks, and so on). Steps in a FAIRWorkflow may very well be 'run this CWL workflow' or 'run this script', so such workflows are expected to sit more on a meta-level, describing the before-and-after of running one of these fully automated computational workflows as well.\n"
