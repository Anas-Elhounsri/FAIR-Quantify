A small host library allows an application to determine its own energy efficiency. The high time resolution provides much better insight into energy usage than low-resolution built-in power meters (if available at all), as PowerSensor enables analysis of individual compute kernels.\n"

When both are completed succesfully, install the host library with [this guide](INSTALLATION_HOST.md) and get to know the device with the [user guide](USERGUIDE.md).\n\n## Installing the PowerSensor\nBefore starting, turn off and unplug the power of the host system. In the case of a GPU, a PCI-e riser card or cable is needed to be able to measure the 3.3 V and 12 V power coming from the PCI-e slot of the motherboard. 12 V power coming directly from the PSU can be connected to a PowerSensor3 sensor board. A second ATX power cable should be used to connect the PowerSensor3 sensor board to the GPU. Take care to use sensor boards with appropiate voltage and current sensors, taking into account the maximum voltage and current:\n\nConnection  | Voltage (V) | Maximum power (W) | Maximum current (A)\n------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------\nPCI-e 3.3 V | 3.3         | 10                | 3.0\nPCI-e 12 V  | 12          | 65                | 5.4\nATX 6-pin   | 12          | 75                | 6.3\nATX 8-pin   | 12          | 150               | 12.5\n\nAfter connecting all relevant power cable, connect the microcontroller to a USB port on the host. After making sure that everything is connected correctly, turn on the host system.\n\n## Building the firmware\nWe provide pre-built binaries [here](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/PowerSensor3/releases) for default configurations using either any of the supported microcontrollers. For non-default settings or other customizations, the firmware can be built with the Arduino toolkit as outlined in this section. Note that the pre-built binaries use a modified USB transmit buffer size, see the [USB Buffer size](#usb-buffer-size) section.\n\n\nThe firmware is dependent on a few Arduino tools, these should be installed before continueing. First the [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) package can be installed on Linux via:\n\n    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sh\n\nNext, the [stm32duino](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32) package should be installed, this ensures that STM32 boards can be used in combination with arduino. Start by updating the arduino core:\n\n    arduino-cli core update-index\n\nThen, if there is not already a config file at `~/.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml`, create a config file with:\n\n    arduino-cli config init\n\nOpen the configuration file in any editor and add new board manager URL to:\n\n    board_manager:\n      additional_urls:\n        [https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json]\n\nUpdate the core again:\n\n    arduino-cli core update-index\n\narduino-cli will automatically install the STM32 core when building the firmware.  \n**NOTE**, the current latest version (2.5.0) does not work with PowerSensor3. See [this Github issue](https://github.com/nlesc-recruit/PowerSensor3/issues/125) for details and a workaround.\n\nThen run the following command in the device folder to build the firmware with default flags:\n\n    make device\n\nFor an STM32F401 or STM32F411 Black Pill, the fimware will be written to `PowerSensor/build/STMicroelectronics.stm32.GenF4/PowerSensor.ino.bin`, for the STM32F407 Discovery, the file location is `PowerSensor/build/STMicroelectronics.stm32.Disco/PowerSensor.ino.bin`.\n\n### Uploading the firmware\nFirst make sure the device is booted in DFU mode. This is typically achieved by holding down the BOOT0 button and pressing the RESET button. Confirm that the device has entered DFU mode with either:\n\n    lsusb\n    dfu-util -l\n\nThe firmware can be uploaded with `dfu-util` or `arduino-cli`. The latter can only be used when compiling the firmware yourself.\nTo upload with `dfu-util` run the following command, adapting the -a and -i options as necessary to match the output of `dfu-util -l`:\n\n    dfu-util -a 0 -i 0 -s 0x08000000:leave -D /path/to/PowerSensor3/firmware.bin\n\nTo upload with `arduino-cli`, first make sure you can build the firmware as outlined in the previous section.\nThen run the following command in the device folder, adding any flags in the same way as with the `make device` command.\n\n    make upload\n\nIf the firmware is uploaded successfully, the device will be reset and start running the PowerSensor3 firmware.\n\n### Build customization\nThere are several options available to customize the firmware build. These options can be append to the `make device` and `make upload` commands.\n\n## Target microcontroller\nA flag is provided to set whether the firmware is built for an STM32F401, STM32F411 (default) or STM32F407 microcontroller.  \nOption name: DEV  \nAllowed values: F401, F411, F407  \nExample:\n\n    make upload DEV=\"F401\"\n\n\n## Extra flags\nDefines that would usually be given to the compiler with the `-D` option can be set with `make` using the `FLAGS` option.\nCurrently supported flags relate to the display:\n`-DNODISPLAY` disables the display completely. This also means that the external libraries, located in `PowerSensor/Libraries` are not used.\n`-DTFT_BLUE` changes the display type from the default green tab to a blue tab. Effectively, this only inverts the display colours.\n`-DDEMO` enables updating the display during measurements, meant for demos. Updating the display interferes with the measurement interval, so this mode should not be used when accurate measurements are required.\nMultiple flags should be separated by a space.\nExample command:\n\n    make upload FLAGS=\"-DTFT_BLUE\"\n\n## USB buffer size\nThe STM32 USB library has a default transmit buffer size that is too small to handle the high data rate used in PowerSensor3. When using the default buffer size, you will most likely see dropped data. The buffer size is set in the `cdc_queue.h` file, part of stm32duino. This file is usually located at `<Arduino folder>/packages/STMicroelectronics/hardware/stm32/2.3.0/cores/arduino/stm32/usb/cdc/cdc_queue.h`\n\nWe provide a patch file to increase the buffer size (tested with version 2.3.0 of stm32duino), as well as a Python script to locate the stm32duino folder. To automatically update the `cdc_queue.h` file, run something like this from the root of the PowerSensor3 repository:\n\n    REPO_ROOT=$PWD\n    STM32_DIR=$(python/get_arduino_stm32_directory.py)\n    cd ${STM32_DIR}/cores/arduino/stm32/usb/cdc\n    patch < ${REPO_ROOT}/patch/cdc_queue.patch\n\nThen proceed with building the firmware with `arduino-cli` as usual.\n\n## Next steps\nAfter installing the device, proceed with installing the host library with [this guide](INSTALLATION_HOST.md).\n"

When finished, get to know the device with the [user guide](USERGUIDE.md).\n\n## Installation\nThe PowerSensor host library can be built with cmake. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed and run the following commands in the `host` directory to build and install to the default location (typically `/usr/local/`):\n\n    cmake -S . -B build\n    make\n    make install\n\nTo install to a different location, use the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option of cmake.\n\n## Python bindings\nPython bindings were created with Pybind11. To use these, make sure you have a recent version of Python3 and install Pybind11, typically with\n\n    pip install pybind11\n\nTo compile the PowerSensor Python bindings, add `-DPYTHON_BINDINGS=ON` to the cmake command. You may need to point cmake to the Pybind11 directory with `-Dpybind11_DIR=$(pybind11-config --cmakedir)`. This generates a shared library under `build/python`, which you can copy to any folder where Python can find it, or you can add the folder with the library to `PYTHONPATH`.\n\n## Next steps\nTo test your installation and get familiar with using PowerSensor have a look at the [user guide](USERGUIDE.md)."
