These\nparameters are required to generate estimates of `theta`, `phi topics`, and\n`phi opionions`.\n\nSet the `nTopics`, `sampleEstimateStart`, and `sampleEstimateEnd` parameters in\nthe experiment configuration file. Next, generate esitmates of `theta`,\n`phi topics`, and `phi opionions`:\n\n    python cptm/experiment_get_results.py /path/to/experiment.json\n\nNow you can go back to the iPython notebook to have a look at the topics and\nopinions.\n\nThe notebook prints the top 5 topic words for all topics and the top 5 of\ncorresponding opinion words for each perspective. By default, the topics are\nordered by topic number. They can also be ordered by Jensen-Shannon divergence\nof the opinions. That requires calculating the Jensen-Shannon divergences:\n\n    python cptm/experiment_jsd_opinions.py /path/to/experiment.json\n\n[Fang et al. 2012] describes contrastive opinion modeling, a method to\ndetermine opinions for individual topic words. To do contrastive opinion\nmodeling for all topic words (and save the results on disk), run:\n\n    python cptm/experiment_find_contrastive_opinions.py /path/to/experiment.json\n    [-p <list of perspectives>] [-o /path/to/output]\n\nThe `<list of perspectives>` should be formatted like: `\"['Kok II-ChristenUnie',\n'Kok II-CDA', 'Kok II-LPF', 'Kok II-PvdA', 'Kok II-SGP', 'Kok II-D66',\n'Kok II-GroenLinks', 'Kok II-VVD', 'Kok II-SP']\"` (including the double quotes).\n\nThere are some additional scripts:\n\n* `experiment_calculate_perspective_jsd.py`\ncalculates the pairwise average jsd between perspectives for all topics:\n\n    python experiment_calculate_perspective_jsd.py experiment.json\n\n* `experiment_prune_samples.py` removes saved parameter samples (generated by the\nGibbs sampler) for certain iterations. Before, the Gibbs sampler saved estimates\nfor all iterations. However, because this took to much disk space, now the\nsampler only saves every tenth estimate. The `experiment_prune_samples` script\nremoves samples for results generated with an old version of the sampler:\n\n    python experiment_prune_samples.py /path/to/experiment.json\n\n* `experiment_manifesto.py` calculates opinion word perplexity per document for\na set of text documents. The corpus is not divided in perspectives. (This script\nis used to estimate the likelihood of party manifestos given opinions for the\ndifferent perspectives (party manifestos come from the manifesto project)) First\nrun `manifestoproject2cptm_input.py` to create a cptm corpus that can be used\nas input:\n\n    python experiment_manifesto.py <experiment.json> \\<input dir> \\<output dir>\n\n* `experiment_theta_for_texts_perspectives.py` extracts a document/topic\nmatrix for a set of text documents. The corpus is not divided in perspectives.\nThis script is used to calculate theta for the CAP vragenuurtje data. First\nrun `tabular2cptm_input.py` to create a cptm corpus that can be used\nas input:\n\n    python experiment_theta_for_texts_perspectives.py <experiment.json> \\<input dir> \\<output dir>\n\n* `experiment_corr_pca_ches.py` calculate correlations between PCA projections\nand CHES rankings:\n\n    python experiment_corr_pca_ches.py <experiment.json> <inpt ches data> [-o /path/to/output]\n\n\n* `experiment_cptcorpus_count_words.py` counts the number of topic and opinion\nwords in the corpus:\n\n    python experiment_cptcorpus_count_words.py <experiment.json>\n\n"
