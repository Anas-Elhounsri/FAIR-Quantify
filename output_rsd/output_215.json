Check the help of a\nsubcommand with `--help` or `-h` for short, e.g.:\n```text\nasreview simulation clr-logistic --help\n```\nThe above command will print:\n \n```text\nUsage: asreview simulation clr-logistic [OPTIONS]\n\n  Configure the simulation to use Logistic Regression classifier.\n\nOptions:\n  --c FLOAT             Parameter inverse to the regularization strength of\n                        the model.  [default: 1.0]\n  --class_weight FLOAT  Class weight of the inclusions.  [default: 1.0]\n  -f, --force           Force setting the querier configuration, even if that\n                        means overwriting a previous configuration.\n  -h, --help            Show this message and exit.\n\n  This command is chainable with other commands. Chained commands are\n  evaluated left to right; make sure to end the chain with the 'start'\n  command, otherwise it may appear like nothing is happening.\n\n  Please report any issues at:\n\n  https://github.com/asreview-simulation/asreview-simulation/issues.\n``` \nPassing parameters to a subcommand goes like this:\n```text\nasreview simulation \\\n    clr-logistic --class_weight 1.1 \\\n    start --benchmark benchmark:van_de_Schoot_2017 --out ./project.asreview\n```\nBy using individually parameterized, chained subcommands we can compose a\nvariety of configurations, e.g.:\n```text\nasreview simulation \\\n    sam-random --n_included 10 --n_excluded 15            \\\n    fex-tfidf --ngram_max 2                               \\\n    clr-nb --alpha 3.823                                  \\\n    qry-max-random --fraction_max 0.90 --n_instances 10   \\\n    bal-double --a 2.156 --alpha 0.95 --b 0.79 --beta 1.1 \\\n    stp-nq --n_queries 20                                 \\\n    start --benchmark benchmark:van_de_Schoot_2017 --out ./project.asreview\n```\n \n"
