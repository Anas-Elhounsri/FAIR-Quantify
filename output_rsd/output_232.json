It is not\n  trivial to define which countries should do more. This is\n  a matter of fairness. But what is fair in this context?\n  Should rich countries mitigate more, because they have the\n  means to do so? Or the countries that have emitted a lot\n  in the past? Clearly, there is no single answer, because\n  it depends on what you think is fair. However, these\n  principles can be quantified. The Carbon Budget Explorer\n  allows navigating through the implications of different\n  views on fairness.\nkeywords:\n  - Climate change\n  - Carbon budget\n  - Fair shares\n  - Climate policy\nlicense: Apache-2.0\nidentifiers:\n  - type: doi\n    value: 10.5281/zenodo.11120650\n    description: Initial release\n"

        "description": "Web application to visualize countries' carbon emission pathways under various views on fairness.\r\n\r\nMany countries commit to rapid climate action, but their ambitions don't add up to reach the Paris goals. It is not trivial to define which countries should do more. This is a matter of fairness. But what is fair in this context? Should rich countries mitigate more, because they have the means to do so? Or the countries that have emitted a lot in the past? Clearly, there is no single answer, because it depends on what you think is fair. However, these principles can be quantified. The Carbon Budget Explorer allows navigating through the implications of different views on fairness.\r\n\r\n",
