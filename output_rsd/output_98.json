Please read and follow our Code of Conduct [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n- you have a question;\n- you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n- you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation).\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n- use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-initializer-javascript/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n- if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n- use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cff-initializer-javascript/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n- if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the version of cffinit (bottom right in the app);\n    - if you are using a development version, the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n- (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n- (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being implemented;\n- if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest main commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the main branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/);\n- read the [developer documentation](README.dev.md);\n- make sure the existing tests still work;\n- add your own tests (if necessary);\n- update or expand the developer documentation;\n- [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to (your fork of) the cff-initializer-javascript repository on GitHub;\n- create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/);\n- verify that the GitHub workflows passed (if they don't, mark the PR as a draft while you fix it);\n- don't request reviews, the reviewer will assign them themselves. \n\nIf you don't know how to write or run tests or generate documentation, don't let this discourage you; we can help! Ask for help on the relevant issue so we can decide how to proceed.\n"

        "description": "Main changes:\r\n- Remove the concept of basic/advanced. All steps are visible on the screen, with the required and optional marked.\r\n- Add more paragraphs to each screen, explaining the form better.\r\n- Change visual feedback on the stepper to only show errors on previous screens.\r\n- Keep the state of visited screen, and mark passing visited screens with done, even if they are ahead of the current screen. This means that going forward and then going back won't \"unmark\" the screen as done.\r\n- Limit navigation based on validation. Don't allow clicking next if the screen has errors. Don't allow clicking download or finish if there are any errors. Don't allow clicking on the stepper to bypass erroring screens.\r\n- Create a screen to add any extra information to the CITATION.cff file. This will be parsed and validated as CFF as well, but the errors are not treated.\r\n- Create a screen to paste existing CFF files and parse them. The parsing requirements are defined in the README.dev.md file. The objective is to allow updating existing CFF.",

        "description": "Summary of changes:\r\n\r\n- Change the appearance (UI) of the app. It aligns with the landing page now and is visually more pleasant than before. This involves many small changes, which I won\u2019t go into detail.\r\n- Fix the usage of headings (h1, h2, etc.). Now, we use the correct ones and change their size globally.\r\n- Fix label and aria-label usage in inputs, buttons, and other elements.\r\n- Add alt to images and set explicit `alt=\u201d\u201d` for images that are just decorative.\r\n- Add hidden skip links for accessibility purposes. The first TAB on a page leads to a \u201cskip to main content\u201d link that jumps to the `#form-title` and next there is a \u201cskip to stepper navigation\u201d that jumps to the stepper. The mechanism allows adding more links.\r\n- Update Quasar to 2.10.1 to fix a bug related to ORCID.\r\n- Include a link to the landing page.\r\n- Improve keyboard usage experience.\r\n- Use roles and landmark tags.\r\n\r\nInternal changes:\r\n\r\n- Refactor preview, stepper, and large chunks of the LayoutStepper.\r\n- Remove unnecessary classes, and try to use most of the Quasar classes and elements. This is more in accordance with the purpose of a CSS framework.",

This replaced the link to the guide, which was just a link to the CFF schema. The new dialog includes a brief description, examples if applicable, and URLs.\r\n1. With the change in the dialogs, we now have an example and some description for the most confusing fields (name-particle and repository-* being the famous cases). This resolves a few of the common pain points in our feedback sessions.\r\n1. We improved the responsiveness on mobile, small screens, and very large screens.\r\n1. We changed the last screen of the app, which has a \"Download\" and \"reset\" buttons, to make the \"reset\" less prominent.\r\n1. We gave better feedback below the Preview. If one of the required fields are missing, the message is different.\r\n1. We fixed a bug with trailing white spaces on URLs.\r\n1. You can now remove authors and identifiers without clicking on edit first.\r\n1. The ORCID field has a mask now.\r\n1. Clicking on \"Reset\" asks for confirmation.\r\n\r\nDeveloper important changes:\r\n\r\n1. We have end-to-end testing with Cypress.\r\n1. We added CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files, which should help with future maintainers.",
