Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation).\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/ci-for-research/self-hosted-runners/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n1. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/ci-for-research/self-hosted-runners/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community _before you start working_. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``python setup.py test``;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to (your fork of) the Fortran_Davidson repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n"

This can be useful when the code you want to test has special requirements, for example if\n\n- it needs a GPU to run ([CUDA installation with ansible instructions](/install-cuda/README.md))\n- it needs multiple nodes\n- testing requires data that needs to stay on-premises for privacy reasons or legal reasons\n- testing requires data that is too big to move\n- testing requires specific software\n\nThis guide distinguishes between the _client_ and the _server_; the client is your own machine; the server is whichever\nmachine runs the tests. For either side, we'll explain what configuration needs to be done. For people who just want to\ntry out the instructions but don't have access to remote hardware, we included a few alternatives for running the server\nlocally as well, through the use of virtualization (with VirtualBox) and containerization (with Docker).\n\nFor the client, we included instructions for Linux Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows; the server-side instructions all assume\nLinux Ubuntu.\n\n| Status | Client OS | Server hardware | Runner |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| :heavy_check_mark: Completed | Linux Ubuntu | local machine via Docker           | [link](/ubuntu-docker/README.md)          |\n| :heavy_check_mark: Completed | Linux Ubuntu | local machine via Singularity      | [link](/ubuntu-singularity/README.md)     |\n| :heavy_check_mark: Completed | Linux Ubuntu | local machine via Vagrant          | [link](/ubuntu-vagrant/README.md)         |\n| :heavy_check_mark: Completed | Linux Ubuntu | local machine via VirtualBox       | [link](/ubuntu-virtualbox/README.md)      |\n| :heavy_check_mark: Completed | Linux Ubuntu | remote machine at [SURF HPC Cloud] | [link](/ubuntu-surf-hpc-cloud/README.md)  |\n| :hourglass_flowing_sand: WIP | Mac          | local machine via Docker           | -                                         |\n| :hourglass_flowing_sand: WIP | Mac          | local machine via Vagrant          | -                                         |\n| :hourglass_flowing_sand: WIP | Mac          | local machine via VirtualBox       | -                                         |\n| :hourglass_flowing_sand: WIP | Mac          | remote machine at [SURF HPC Cloud] | -                                         |\n| :hourglass_flowing_sand: WIP | Windows      | local machine via Docker           | -                                         |\n| :heavy_check_mark: Completed | Windows      | local machine via Vagrant          | [link](windows-vagrant/README.md)         |\n| :hourglass_flowing_sand: WIP | Windows      | local machine via VirtualBox       | -                                         |\n| :heavy_check_mark: Completed | Windows      | remote machine at [SURF HPC Cloud] | [link](/windows-surf-hpc-cloud/README.md) |\n"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
