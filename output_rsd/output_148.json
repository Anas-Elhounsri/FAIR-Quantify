Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community _before you start working_. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of concensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest main commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the main branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. see [developer documentation](README.dev.md) for hints how to make changes;\n1. make sure the existing unit tests still work by running ``npm test``;\n1. make sure that no lint errors are present work by running ``npm lint``;\n1. add your own unit tests and integration tests (if necessary);\n1. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to (your fork of) the this repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request (have a look at some of our old pull requests to see how this works).\n"
