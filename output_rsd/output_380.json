The\n  toolbox facilitates the detection and analysis of sensor\n  data, focusing on key gait and photoplethysmography (PPG)\n  features that are critical for PD research. By leveraging\n  the Time Series Data Format (TSDF), a unified and\n  user-friendly format for handling both numerical data and\n  metadata, Paradigma simplifies the process of working with\n  raw binary sensor measurements alongside JSON-based\n  metadata. The toolbox enables researchers to efficiently\n  extract PD biomarkers, aiding in early diagnosis and\n  monitoring. Future updates will introduce tremor detection\n  and expanded feature extraction capabilities, further\n  enhancing its utility for PD research and clinical\n  applications.\nkeywords:\n  - parkinson's disease\n  - digital biomarkers\n  - gait analysis\n  - ppg signal\n  - imu data\nlicense: Apache-2.0\n"
