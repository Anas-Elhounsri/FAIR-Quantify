        "value": "# Contributing to Loris\n\nWe'd love to have you contribute to Loris. The first thing you should\ndo before contributing is probably sign up for the [LORIS developers'\nmailing list](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/mailman/listinfo/loris-dev).\n\nYour next step before issuing a pull request is to review our\n[Coding Standards](./docs/CodingStandards.md). If you are doing\nfront-end development you should also check out our [React\nguidelines](./docs/wiki/99_Developers/ReactJS_Guidelines.md).\n\nYou can also learn about our code\nreview process by perusing our [Code Review\nChecklist](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Code-Review-Checklist)\nin the [LORIS Wiki](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki). These will be\nsome of the factors we'll consider when reviewing your code.\n\n## Development branches\n\nFor the most part, changes to the codebase should be sent to the `main`\nbranch, which is the default.\n\nSmall bug fixes for a given version of LORIS should be sent to the branch named\nfor that version. For example, fixing a bug in LORIS version 22 should be sent\nto the `22.0-release` branch.\n\n## Pull Request Title and Description\n\nTo make it easier for reviewers to locate pull requests with which they have\nexpertise, we request that new pull requests follow a few conventions.\n\n#### Title\n\nThe title should begin with square brackets enclosing the name of the\nmodule that you are changing followed by a brief description.\n\ne.g. This is a well-formed title. \n\n> [Imaging Uploader / Server Process Manager] Fix invalid upload state\n\nIf you are instead editing the `Core` libraries or the `tools` directory,\netc., you can supply these values in place of a module name.\n\nThere should be plenty of other examples in the list of pull requests\nin the main code repository.\n\n#### Description\n\nWhen opening a pull request on GitHub you will see a pull request\ntemplate. Please fill out each heading with detailed information on your\ncode changes, suggested testing instructions, and links to open GitHub\nissues and/or Redmine tickets (if applicable).\n\n## Some Things To Keep In Mind\n\n* If your changes require any table modifications:\n    1. Review our [SQL standard](./docs/SQLModelingStandard.md).\n    2. Modify the `SQL/0000*.sql` file(s) with your changes. These patches\n    are applied during the LORIS install.  \n    3. Include a patch to be used by existing projects. These should go in the \n    `SQL/New_patches/` directory.\n    4. For SQL patches that are _optional_ (e.g. those that perform some \n            cleanup), place them in `SQL/Cleanup_patches/`.\n    5. The files for our test database (Raisinbread) must be updated if they were modified.\n        Detailed instructions for this step can be found in the Raisin Bread [README.md](./raisinbread/README.md#exporting-rb).\n* Include a test for any new module in the `modules/MODULENAME/test/`\n  directory. You can look at other modules for examples of how to\n  write tests.\n* Before sending any pull request, make sure you run our static analysis tools \nlocally. More information can be found in the [testing guide](./docs/wiki/99_Developers/Automated_Testing.md). \n* Try and make all changes backwards-compatible with existing installations.  \n* If you must change something in a non-backwards-compatible way - or if it \nwould affect the data or custom code of a study - document this in your pull \nrequest description and tag it with **Caveat for Existing Projects**. \nThis helps us to document our release notes.\n* You can run the command `make checklanguage` to ensure that documentation\nyou've contributed contains language that is friendly and accessible.\n* Be sure to modify the `CHANGELOG.md` file.\n\nIf you're unsure about any of the above, feel free to ask us for\nclarification via the mailing list.\n\n## Git Best Practices\n- Any changes should be done on a branch based on the current development branch and contain only the changes which are applicable for that branch. (ie don't merge the `main` branch back into your branch, and don't include commits that are unrelated) so that if someone merges the branch into their repository, they only get that branch's changes.\n- Commits should be atomic (self contained) and contain only the changes described by the commit message. The commit message should be a sentence that describes the goal of the change as a whole.\n- Avoid changing unrelated code in the same commit, even if it is an improvement.\nWe prefer that you create two separate pull requests A and B rather than add a\n'quick bonus fix' to pull request A.\n- ALWAYS do a diff before committing (after doing \"git add file1 file2\" when you're planning on doing `git commit`, you can use `git diff --staged` to see a diff of what will be committed). Ensure that nothing unexpected is included.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you're looking for ideas for a way to contribute but don't know where\nto begin, here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n* You can browse some of our public\n[Issues](https://github.com/aces/Loris/issues). Issues tagged with **Beginner\nFriendly** are good ones to tackle if you are new to LORIS development.\n* You can help improve our documentation if you find any parts of it\nconfusing or lacking.\n* You can track down bugs by browsing the application and reviewing the\nPHP error log.\n"

        "value": "## Installation\n\nThe steps for installing a LORIS instrument depend on the instrument format \nchosen (**PHP** or **LINST**) and the data storage type selected (**SQL** table \nor **JSON**). This document details different installation options for all types \nof instruments. \n\n### OPTION 1: SQL Table Storage\n#### LINST Instruments - The Instrument Manager \n**The Instrument Manager** module is available to users with the appropriate \npermissions. This module allows front-end users to upload LINST instruments into \nthe web browser which will then be automatically installed. This module only \nfunctions with LINST instruments which are set to use a dedicated SQL table in \nthe database. \n\nFollow the steps below in order to use the Instrument Manager for your instrument.\n\n  1. Navigate to the Instrument Manager module under the **Admin** menu.\n  2. Navigate to the upload tab within the module\n  3. Choose browse and select the file you have saved from the Instrument Builder \n  (the file must have a `.linst` extension)\n  4. Click \"Install\" to submit your instrument.\n\nAfter installing your instrument, you can load it in a timepoint to test it. For \ninstructions on populating instruments in a timepoint navigate directly to the \n[Test Battery](./07_clinical_test_battery.md) section directly or continue \nfollowing the documentation.\n\n> _**Note:** The instrument manager requires some special configurations to \n>function properly. Make sure to read the module's [spec sheet](../../../../modules/instrument_manager/README.md) \n>before attempting your first instrument install._\n\n#### PHP Instruments\n**PHP instruments** behave slightly differently than LINST instruments and \nrequire more manual steps for installation. In order to be able to generate the \nSQL table for PHP instruments, they must first be parsed. The LORIS codebase \nincludes a tool under the `tools/` directory called the `lorisform_parser.php` \nallowing for a PHP instrument to be parsed into an intermediary serialized format \nand automatically stored in the `tools/ip_output.txt` file.\n\nThe intermediary state is necessary for the generation of the SQL `CREATE TABLE` \npatch which, in turn, is necessary for the install process when using dedicated \nSQL table storage. In order to get from the intermediary serialized format to an \nSQL table, the `generate_tables_sql.php` tool is then used on the `ip_output.txt` file.\n\nFollow the steps below to install a new PHP instrument.\n\n  1. Move your newly created instrument `NDB_BVL_Instrument_TEST_NAME.class.inc` \n  into the `project/instruments/` directory.\n  2. Navigate to the LORIS `tools/` directory.\n  3. Run the instrument through the `lorisform_parser.php` to parse the PHP \n  instrument into the intermediary serialed format.\n  \t\t```\n  \t\tls ../project/instruments/NDB_BVL_Instrument_TEST_NAME.class.inc | php lorisform_parser.php\n  \t\t```\n  4. Run the `generate_tables_sql.php` tool to converted the serialized format \n  into an SQL `CREATE TABLE` SQL patch. The patch will be created in the `project/` \n  directory by default.\n  \t\t```\n  \t\tphp generate_tables_sql.php\n  \t\t```\n  5. Source the newly generated SQL patch `project/TEST_NAME.sql` into your SQL \n  database to create the table.\n  6. Register the instrument in the `test_names` table of the database by running \n  the following command. Make sure to replace the `'TEST_NAME'` value with the \n  actual test name used in your instrument. \n  \n  \t```\n  \tINSERT INTO test_names (Test_name,Sub_group) SELECT 'TEST_NAME', ID FROM test_subgroups WHERE Subgroup_name='Instruments';\n  \t```\n  \t\n  > _**Note:** The `Sub_group` entry in the query above is necessary for the \n  > instrument registration. See the [Instrument Grouping](#instrument-grouping) \n  > section below for additional details._\n  \t\t\nBy completing these steps the instrument should be installed and ready to be \nassigned to a battery; only instruments assigned to a behavioural test battery \nare available for data entry For more information about test batteries, navigate \nto the [Test Battery](./07_clinical_test_battery.md) section directly or continue \nfollowing the documentation.\n\n> _**Note:** Each PHP tool mentioned above contains documentation at the top of \n>the file in case additional details are required._\n\n\n### OPTION 2: JSON Data Storage\n**PHP and LINST instruments using JSON data storage** do not require a dedicated \nSQL table on the database thus making their installation much simpler. Once your \ninstrument is finalized, save it and move it to the `project/instruments/` directory \n(this is the same location the Instrument Manager stores installed instruments). \nOnce the instrument is in the correct location, you must add it manually to the \n`test_names` table of the database to register it. The following query can be used \nas a template for the registration.\n  \n ```\n  \tINSERT INTO test_names (Test_name,Sub_group) SELECT 'TEST_NAME', ID FROM test_subgroups WHERE Subgroup_name='Instruments';\n ```\n> _**Note:** The `Sub_group` entry in the query above is necessary for the \n>instrument registration. See See the [Instrument Grouping](#instrument-grouping) \n>section below for additional details._\n  \t\t\nBy completing these steps the instrument should be installed and ready to be \nassigned to a battery; only instruments assigned to a behavioural test battery \nare available for data entry For more information about test batteries, navigate \nto the [Test Battery](./07_clinical_test_battery.md) section directly or continue \nfollowing the documentation.\n\n> _**Note:** The `TEST_NAME` value in the SQL statement must match exactly the \n>LINST file name  without the extension or the `testname` value in PHP instruments \n>(i.e. The `TEST_NAME` value for `bmi.linst` is `bmi`)._\n\n## Instrument Grouping\n\nIn the interest of organization, LORIS allows for instruments to be categorized \non the User interface when displayed in the web browser. This categorization \nis made possible by the `test_subgroups` database table. Instruments are then \nassigned to categories and sorted accordingly on the user's interface. \n\nNew entries can be added to the `test_subgroups` table to create new categories\n and instruments can be assigned a category by updating the `Sub_group` column \n in the `test_names` table with the desired `ID` from the `test_subgroups` table.\n\n\n\n\n"

[Running the Install Script and Web-based Database Installer](#running-the-install-script-and-web-based-database-installer)\n3. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n\n***\n\n## Notes on Operating systems and Dependencies \n\n### Ubuntu \n* The install script should install Composer and dependencies including smarty3.  There is no need to install these dependencies before running the install script.  \n* Note that PHP 7 and MySQL 5.7 are recommended for LORIS 17.0 (Fall 2016)\n\n### CentOS\n\n* There aren't exact 17.0 instructions for CentOS but most of the next section will work with CentOS. The information [here](https://github.com/aces/Loris/blob/master/README.CentOS6.md) may help with your install process until instructions are written.\n\n## Running the Install Script and Web-based Database Installer\nThe Install script and web-based database installer is designed to be run on Ubuntu (14+) or CentOS systems. \n\nThe new instructions may be found [here](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Installing-Loris-(After-Installing-Prerequisites))\n\n## Troubleshooting \n\nIf re-running the Install script, remove (rename) the config.xml file stored in the project/ directory.  If this file exists, the install script will abort. \n\nFor Ubuntu installations, if any difficulties are encountered in the install script, [[Composer|https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx]] can be manually installed thus: \nTo manually install [[Composer|https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx]]\n```bash\n  curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php;\n  sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer\n  composer install\n```\n\nRunning _composer install_ may fail if you do not have a project/libraries directory created: \n```\n   cd /var/www/loris/\n   mkdir -p project/libraries\n   composer install # try again\n```\n\n``` \nNOTE: Smarty 3 is installed by Composer. For Ubuntu the recommended smarty3 package can be manually installed using: \n> apt-get install smarty3\n```\n\nOnce your install script has finished running, **if your Loris does not load**:\n* Check your apache logs.  e.g. Ubuntu: /var/log/apache2/_$project_-error.log and _$project_-access.log\n\n* If you see a PHP Fatal error about DateTime -- set your timezone in your php.ini file.  The error usually looks like this:\n\n> PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'DateTime::__construct() ...\n\n* Verify your Loris Configuration settings in the database -- see [[Troubleshooting Configuration|Project-Customization#troubleshooting-configuration-settings]] notes\n\n**[[NEXT: (2) Project Customization|Project Customization]]**"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

https://github.com/aces/Loris/compare/v24.1.4...v25.0.0\r\n\r\n### Notes For Existing Projects\r\n- API: Modified in v0.0.4-dev the candidate instrument data format returned by a GET request or provided as the body of a PUT/PATCH request. The values of all fields are now defined by the `Data` key instead of `$InstrumentName` (PR #7857)\r\n\r\n### Notes For Developers\r\n- Require jsodc comments to have correct `@return` and `@param` values in javascript (PR #8266)\r\n- Disable ESLint on build (prod instances) (PR #8229)\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Process\r\n### 24.1.x to 25\r\n1. Get the 25.0.0 source code\r\n2. Source the `SQL/Release_patches/24.1_To_25.0_upgrade.sql` SQL file into your database.\r\n\r\n4. Run the following scripts:\r\n    1. `php tools/configuration_check.php `\r\n         _This script is used to validate the configuration of LORIS. It checks configuration settings and server paths to make sure that the application and underlying architecture are set up to allow LORIS to run properly._\r\n    2. `php tools/single_use/migrate_instrument_permissions.php`\r\n        _This script migrates instrument permissions from the config.xml to the new database tables that now store them._\r\n    2. `php tools/single_use/update_violations_resolved_hashes.sql.php`\r\n         _This script is intended for a one-time use only to update the hasing of the violations_resolved table. Not doing so will result in duplication of data in the `violations_resolved` tale when users update a resolution status for a violation._\r\n4. Run `make all` from the LORIS root directory.\r\n5. OPTIONAL: Run any cleanup patches in `SQL/Archive/25.0/Cleanup/`\r\n6. OPTIONAL: Remove the `<instrumentPermissions>` tag from your config.xml which is no longer used after running the migration script.",

The instructions in those releases should be disregarded._\r\n\r\n### 23.x.y to 24.0.0\r\n1. Get the 24.1.2 source code\r\n2. Source the `SQL/Release_patches/23.0_To_24.0_upgrade_A.sql` SQL file into your database.\r\n3. Run the following scripts:\r\n    1. `php tools/configuration_check.php `\r\n         _This script is used to validate the configuration of LORIS. It checks configuration settings and server paths to make sure that the application and underlying architecture are set up to allow LORIS to run properly._\r\n    2. `php tools/single_use/SaveUserIDToInstrumentData.php confirm`\r\n         _This script is intended for a one-time use only to restore the value of the `UserID` column of instrument tables and the `UserID` key of the instrument JSON `Data` in the flag table._\r\n    4. `php tools/single_use/remove_publication_users_edit_perm_rel_duplicates.php`\r\n         _This script deletes duplicate rows in publication_users_edit_perm_rel to make sure the patch '2020-01-07-publication_users_edit_perm_rel_pk.sql' will execute successfully_\r\n    5. `php tools/single_use/Cleanup_Special_Chars_Document_Repository.php`\r\n         _This script is written to clean up the files with special characters from the document repository data table as well as clean up the quotes appearing as %22 in the file names in the file system_\r\n    6. `php tools/single_use/Cleanup_Special_Chars_Media.php`\r\n         _This script is written to clean up the files with special characters from the media data table as well as clean up the quotes appearing as %22 in the file names in the file system_\r\n    7. `php tools/single_use/Remove_duplicate_examiners.php`\r\n         _This script is written to clean up duplicate userIDs in the examiners table_\r\n3. Make sure the `RegistrationProjectID` column in the `candidate` table of the dataabse does not contain any NULL values. If it does, either assign an existing project to the candidate/scanner or create a new project for these entries before running the release patch (see \"Notes for existing projects\" for more details).\r\n4. Source the `SQL/Release_patches/23.0_To_24.0_upgrade_B.sql` SQL file into your database.\r\n5. Run the following scripts:\r\n    1. `php tools/single_use/populate_visits.php`\r\n        _This script populates the `visits` table based on the config.xml, `session` table and `Visit_Windows` table._\r\n    2. `php tools/single_use/Set_Required_elements_completed_flag.php confirm`\r\n        _This script is written to migrate the `Data_entry_completion_status` field from the instrument table (or Data column of the flag table) to it's own column in the flag table called `Required_elements_completed`. Note that this script can take a long time to complete on large projects._\r\n6. Run `make all` on the LORIS root directory\r\n8. OPTIONAL: Source SQL patches from the `SQL/Archive/24.0/Cleanup` directory at your discretion to remove superfluous or deprecated entries in the database.\r\n9. OPTIONAL: Run the `tools/single_use/Remove_Data_entry_completion_status_instr_column.php` PHP script to generate an SQL patch containing all  `DROP COLUMN` statements for the now unused `Data_entry_completion_status` field in instruments. This script will generate the SQL patch and store it in the `SQL/Archive/autogenerated/single_use/` directory under the name `Remove_Data_entry_completion_status.sql`.\r\n10. OPTIONAL: Remove the `<visitLabel subprojectID=\"X\">` tags in the Config.xml file\r\n\r\n***NOTE:** The `tools/single_use/SaveUserIDToInstrumentData.php` can take several hours up to a day to run depending on the size and age of the databse and number of instruments used*\r\n\r\n### 24.0.0 to 24.1.2\r\n11. Source the `SQL/Release_patches/24.0_To_24.1_upgrade.sql` SQL file into your database.\r\n12.

(PR #6853)\r\n- Added support for Amazon S3 (PR #7963)\r\n- Added ability for scripts to bulk load instrument data (PR #6869)\r\n- New data dictionary framework and module (PR #6936)\r\n- New classes to describe a data dictionary (PR #6938)\r\n\r\n#### Updates and Improvements\r\n- Module-specific permissions added for Survey Accounts, Imaging Behavioural\r\nQuality Control, and Behavioural Quality Control. (PR #6041)\r\n- Addition of a new `account_request_date` in `users` table that will be used when\r\nrequesting a new account and will be displayed in the User Accounts module (PR #6191)\r\n- Candidate's age can be retrieved from the Candidate class in days, months, or years (PR #5945)\r\n- Addition of `autoSelect` property to React `SelectElement` allows for auto-selection of\r\nonly available select option (PR #6156)\r\n- An `AcquisitionDate` field has been added to the `files` table (PR #6892)\r\n- Field `Data_entry_completion_status` given its own column in flag, and renamed to\r\n`Required_elements_completed` (PR #6876)\r\n- Addition of `changeProject` and `resetProject` helper functions to the\r\n`LorisIntegrationTest` class to help test project permissions (PR #6912)\r\n- Unit tests added for the `NDB_BVL_Instrument`, `NDB_Page`, `NDB_Factory`,\r\n`User`, and `UserPermissions` libraries (PR #6819, PR #6804, PR #6776, PR #6765)\r\n- The name of a Standard Date field in a LINST instrument must now end with the\r\nstring `_date`. Otherwise, a LORIS exception is thrown. There is no restriction\r\non the naming format of a Basic Date or `MonthYear` field. (PR #6923)\r\n- React Form Select Element now has the ability to set an option in the element\r\nas a disabled option. (PR #7306)\r\n- Pending accounts in Dashboard now includes DCC users (PR #7054)\r\n- Subproject filter added to Behavioural QC module (PR #7430)\r\n- Addition of `date_format` as a DataType in ConfigSettings (PR #6719)\r\n- Addition of new tables to store PET HRRT data (PR #6142)\r\n- Modification of the `parameter_file` table's `Value` field type to `longtext` (PR #7392)\r\n- Addition of 4 configuration settings for the minc2bids converter (PR #7488)\r\n- A PSR3 compatible logging interface was added (PR #7509)\r\n- Multiple classes of errors flagged by `phan` are now fixed (multiple PRs)\r\n- A `LorisInstance` class was added to represent an installed LORIS instance (PR #6118)\r\n- Validation for `DateElement` (JS).

The default value of `CenterID` is `NULL`. Previously, the\r\ndefault for `Center_name` was `AAAA` or `ZZZZ`. (PR #7525)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n- A LINST instrument Date field name now appears correctly (not truncated) on the\r\ninstrument if it includes the string `_date`. (PR #6923)\r\n- A subtest with only static and/or static score fields (i.e. no values to submit)\r\ncan be saved with no errors so that the instrument scoring script can be called. (PR #7124)\r\n- When a superuser edits another user, the labels for each permission is correctly\r\ndisplayed (PR #7451)\r\n- The imaging insertion pipeline (LORIS-MRI scripts) now starts automatically if you have the imaging uploader\r\nauto-launch set to `true` and your current upload overwrites an existing file (PR #7084).\r\n- Script `CouchDB_MRI_Importer` now computes the correct names from the data dictionary\r\nentries associated to MRI comments (PR #7082).\r\n- Candidate library now allows a null sex in the select() function to accommodate\r\nscanner candidates. This prevents an error from being thrown in the candidate parameters module. (PR #7058)\r\n- Fix public pages with missing title (PR #7121)\r\n- Fix \"Go to main page\" broken link (PR #7258)\r\n- Download CSV fix to remove duplicates and entries that partially match the filtering criteria (PR #7242)\r\n- Partially fix instrument escaping issues by reloading instrument and its data upon successful save (PR #7776)\r\n- Fix recognition of null sessionID in NDB_BVL_Instrument (PR #8031)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Modules\r\n#### API\r\n- Creation of a new version of the API under development (v0.0.4-dev) (PR #6944)\r\n- Deletion of support for the oldest version of the API (v0.0.2) (PR #6944)\r\n- Addition of a PATCH request for `/candidates/$CandID/$VisitLabel` to start next\r\nstage when the payload contains a \"Visit\" stage with \"In Progress\" as Status,\r\nwhen the current status of the Visit stage is \"Not Started\". (PR #7479)\r\n- Handle characters that must be urlencoded (such as a space) in the API path for\r\nvisit labels and projects. (PR #7478 & #7463)\r\n- Markdown API documentation was moved into the module docs directory (PR #6151)\r\n#### API Documentation (**New Module**)\r\n- New module mostly intended for developers, this module provides a user\r\ninterface to inspect and try LORIS modules API.\r\n#### Behavioural QC\r\n- Fix a fatal error if the datatable is filtered with \"All instruments\" (PR #6945)\r\n- Fix for the Instrument filter to keep track of the selected value (PR #6945)\r\n#### BrainBrowser\r\n- Now uses Loris API to download imaging files (PR #7824)\r\n#### Candidate Parameters\r\n- Consents may now be grouped in UI of consent tab (PR #6042, PR #6044)\r\n- Fix to prevent titles cut off (PR #6731)\r\n#### Candidate Profile\r\n- New integration test class to test project permissions (PR #6912)\r\n#### Configuration\r\n- Addition of configuration settings for the DICOM to BIDS insertion pipeline (PR #7937)\r\n- Addition of configuration settings for the MINC to BIDS converter script (PR #7488)\r\n#### Conflict Resolver\r\n- Changes are now saved automatically, one by one. Once a conflict is resolved\r\nthe cell that contains the input field will glow green. It is possible to change\r\nthe resolved conflicts to a new value until the page is refreshed. (PR #7558)\r\n- This module's API is now described in a Open API Specification file (schema.yml)\r\nthat can be loaded in the new API Documentation module.\r\n- Change the display of multi select values from \"value1{@}value2\" to \"value1, value2\"\r\n in the Correct Answer column of Unresolved and Resolved Conflicts. (PR #7239)\r\n#### Create timepoint\r\n- Fix a reindexing of the languages array which caused a database insert error.

(PR #6210, #7043)\r\n#### Media\r\n- Fix to display the file name when editing a file (PR #7381)\r\n#### Publication\r\n- Display all filterable columns in datatable (#7277)\r\n- Fix for file deletion (PR #7284)\r\n#### User Accounts\r\n- Fix a false positive validation error when a new LORIS user is added with \"Make\r\nuser name match email address\" and \"Generate new password\". (PR #6803)\r\n- Fix to allow a superuser to create new users with customizable permissions. (#6770)\r\n- Indicate required fields (#6617)\r\n- Fix to show superuser the labels of each permission when editing a user (PR #7451)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n- Fix fatal errors in `delete_candidate.php` tool. (PR #6805, #7275)\r\n- Fix fatal errors in `fix_candidate_age.php` (PR #7546)\r\n- New tool `generate_candidate_externalids.php` to fill external IDs for all\r\ncandidates where a NULL value is found. (PR #7095)\r\n- New tool `populate_visits.php` to back-populate visits from the `config.xml`,\r\n`session` table and `Visit_Windows` table into the `visit` and `visit_project_subproject_rel` (#7663)\r\n- Deprecation of the `populate_visit_windows.php` tool in favour of `populate_visits.php` (#7663)\r\n- Fixes a bug in the way that the data dictionary entries associated to MRI comments were named in the CouchDB database (PR #7082).\r\n\r\n### Clean Up\r\n- Removal of unused variables and unnecessary branching from `getBattery()` and\r\n`getBatteryVerbose()` functions (PR #7167)\r\n- Removal of the `violated_scans_edit` permission (PR #6747)\r\n- Removal for the need of the `VisitLabel` section of the `config.xml` file. All\r\nvisit configurations and their association to projects are now in the database.\r\nThe visits can be removed from the `config.xml` file after running the\r\n`populate_visits.php` script only. (#7663 & #7729)\r\n- Removal of references to Reliability module in Raisinbread (PR #6895)\r\n- Raisinbread visit stage inconsistency changed (PR #6896)\r\n- HRRT patch sourced to Raisinbread (PR #6897)\r\n- Improved consistency of RB data: field UploadLocation of table mri_upload now has an appropriate value (PR #7086)\r\n- The default value of the `ScannerID` field of the `mri_protocol` table is now\r\n`NULL` instead of `0`. This means that if a protocol is valid on all the study's\r\nscanners, then `ScannerID` of the protocol should be set to `NULL` (PR #7496)\r\n\r\n### Notes For Existing Projects\r\n- The `RegistrationProjectID` column of the candidate table and the `ProjectID` column of the session table\r\nin the database are no longer nullable. This means that a value must be set in these fields BEFORE running\r\nthe release SQL patch or it will fail.\r\n- New function `Candidate::getSubjectForMostRecentVisit` replaces `Utility::getSubprojectIDUsingCandID`,\r\nadding the ability to determine which subproject a candidate belongs to given their most recent visit.\r\n- LINST instrument class was modified to implement the `getFullName()` and `getSubtestList()`\r\nfunctions thus making entries in the `test_names` and `instrument_subtests` tables\r\nunnecessary for LINST instruments (PR #7169)\r\n- The script `tools/single_use/remove_publication_users_edit_perm_rel_duplicates.php`\r\nshould be run before upgrading LORIS.\r\n- The `Data_entry_completion_status` column of instrument tables has been migrated\r\nto its own column in the `flag` table, and renamed to `Required_elements_completed`. After script\r\n`Set_Required_elements_completed_flag.php` is run, projects will need to delete the\r\n`Data_entry_completion_status` column of instrument tables. This can be accomplished\r\nby running `Remove_Data_entry_completion_status_instr_column.php`, and then sourcing\r\nthe patch generated by this script. (PR #6876)\r\n- If `_setDataEntryCompletionStatus`, `_determineDataEntryCompletionStatus`, and/or\r\n`updateDataEntryCompletionStatus` are called in any overrides, make sure to replace\r\nall instances with their newly named counterparts, `_setRequiredElementsCompletedFlag`,\r\n`_determineRequiredElementsCompletedFlag`, `updateRequiredElementsCompletedFlag`. (PR #6876)\r\n- Deprecation of `begintable` and `endtable` elements in LINST instruments (PR #7183)\r\n- Deletion of `dateTimeFields` and `monthYearFields` variables in instrument class.\r\nAll references to these variables should be removed from project instruments. (PR #7183)\r\n- Visit definitions is no longer done in the `config.xml`. An importer tool (`populate_visits.php`) is\r\navailable to import the current setup into the `visit` table of the database.\r\nMake sure the visits displayed after these changes are what you expect.\r\nThe visits can be removed from the `config.xml` file after the importer tool is run. (#7663 & #7729)\r\n- There is a new abstract `getDataDictionary()` function in the instrument class\r\nfor the new data dictionary framework. This is already implemented for LINST instruments,\r\nand existing instruments using `LorisForm` can use the `\\LorisFormDictionaryImpl`\r\ntrait to extract it in the same way as `lorisform_parser.php` did for the old `datadict` module.\r\n- The name of a Standard Date field in a LINST instrument must now end with the\r\nstring `_date`. Otherwise, a LORIS exception is thrown. There is no restriction\r\non the naming format of a Basic Date or MonthYear field. (PR #6923)\r\n- Run `tools/single_use/Remove_duplicate_examiners.php` to remove duplicate\r\nexaminers that may have been created before bugfix. Make sure to run this script\r\n_before_ running the `SQL/New_patches/2021-09-28-Unique_examiners.sql`. (PR #7462)\r\n- Deletion of support for the oldest version of the API (v0.0.2) (PR #6944)\r\n- Refer to instructions for clean up scripts meant to remove unused data in the `SQL/Archive/24.0/Cleanup` directory\r\n- all instruments in the test_names module must have a corresponding instrument on the filesystem for the media module to load\r\n- the instrument class's static loadInstanceData function has been replaced with a non-static getInstanceData, calls from existing instruments must be updated appropriately.\r\n\r\n### Notes For Developers\r\n- PHPCS enabled for tools/ and test/  and must now pass on new PRs (Various PRs)\r\n- Auto fix PHPCS support added (npm run lintfix:php) (#6825)\r\n\r\n## Upgrade Process\r\n(See https://github.com/aces/Loris/releases/tag/v24.1.2)\r\n_Note: the minimum version of PHP is now PHP 7.4_\r\n1. ~Get the 24.0.0 source code~\r\n2. ~Run the following scripts:~\r\n    1. `php tools/configuration_check.php `\r\n         _This script is used to validate the configuration of LORIS.

This script will search through the history log to retrospectively populate the userID field. **It's important to note that, depending on the size of your database and history table, the script can take over 15 hours to run.**\r\n\r\nCaveat for projects:\r\nMake sure to run the following scripts in order to remove special characters from links and ensure they are downloadable.\r\n\r\n- tools/single_use/Cleanup_Special_Chars_Media.php (see #7386)\r\n- tools/single_use/Cleanup_Special_Chars_Document_Repository.php (see #7428)\r\n\r\n",
