The purple plus signs provide access to log messages of each repository.\n\n  Checking many repositories will quickly exceed the rate limit of the APIs of GitLab and GitHub and resulting in all remaining repositories to be fully non-compliantly.\n  See `howfairis docs <https://github.com/fair-software/howfairis/#rate-limit>`_ how setup environment variables to increase the rate limit.\n"
