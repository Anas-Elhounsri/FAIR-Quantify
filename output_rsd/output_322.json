Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n   - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n   - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n   - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community _before you start working_. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of concensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. install see [README.md#Contributing](README.md#Contributing)\n1. make sure linter is happy with `jlpm lint`;\n1. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to (your fork of) this repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request (have a look at some of our old pull requests to see how this works, for example [#1](https://github.com/i-VRESSE/jupyterlab-haddock3-configurator/pull/1)).\n\n## You want to publish a new version\n\nAudience for this chapter are the maintainers of this repo.\n\nThere are 3 things that can be published in this repo in this repo:\n\n1. The `packages/core/` directory aka `@i-vresse/wb-core` package, versions of this package are published to npmjs\n2. The `packages/form/` directory aka `@i-vresse/wb-form` package, versions of this package are published to npmjs\n3. The root of the repo, versions of the repo are published as GitHub releases and Zenodo records.\n\nThere is a single [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) that is for consumers of the packages and repo.\n\n### Publish @i-vresse/wb-form package\n\n1. Set version in `packages/form/package.json` with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-form version <patch|minor|major>`\n2. Add changes to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and push changes to main branch\n3. Make sure you are logged in on npm by checking with `yarn npm whoami --scope i-vresse` and optionally login in with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-form npm login --scope i-vresse --publish`\n4. Clean `dist/` with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-form clean`, make sure `yarn dev` is not running\n5. Build with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-form build`\n6. Publish with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-form npm publish --otp <otp code>`\n7. Create git tag for version with `git tag @i-vresse/wb-form@${packages/form/package.json:version}` and `git push origin --tags`\n\n### Publish @i-vresse/wb-core package\n\n1. Set version in `packages/core/package.json` with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-core version <patch|minor|major>`\n2. Add changes to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and push changes to main branch\n3. Make sure you are logged see step 3 in chapter above.\n4. Clean `dist/` with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-core clean`, make sure `yarn dev` is not running\n5. Build with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-core build`\n6. Publish with `yarn workspace @i-vresse/wb-core npm publish --otp <otp code>`\n7. Create git tag for version with `git tag @i-vresse/wb-core@${packages/core/package.json:version}` and `git push origin --tags`\n\nThe `@i-vresse/wb-core` depends on `@i-vresse/wb-form`.\nTo use the core package outside this monorepo make sure the version of the form package it needs has been published.\n\n### Publish repository\n\nThe root, packages and apps have independend versions. To make a release of the whole repo the versions need to be concatenated.\n\n1. Add changes to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)\n2. Set version in `/package.json` with `yarn version <patch|minor|major>` and push changes to main branch\n3. Goto https://github.com/i-VRESSE/jupyterlab-haddock3-configurator/releases/new\n4. Create a tag in format 'v' + version value from `/package.json`\n5. Set title to `i-VRESSE workflow-builder`\n6. Copy `The workflow builder allows you to create a complex TOML formatted config file based on a set of JSON schemas.` to release description\n7. Append newest sections in CHANGELOG.md to release description\n8. Release it\n"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
