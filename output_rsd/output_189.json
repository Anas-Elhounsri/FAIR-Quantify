Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas>) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n- add relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n- (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n- (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n- if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions from GitHub: [instruction 1: configuring a remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [instruction 2: syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n- make sure the existing tests still work by running, e.g. `pytest tests`;\n- add your own tests (if necessary);\n- update or expand the documentation;\n- make sure the linting tests pass by running `ruff` in the project root directory: `ruff check .`;\n- [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to (your fork of) the sarxarray repository on GitHub;\n- create the pull request, e.g. following [the instructions: creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request."
