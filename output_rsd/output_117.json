Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation);\n1. you want to make a new release of the code base.\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/AI4S2S/ai4s2s/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n3. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/AI4S2S/ai4s2s/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the SHA hashcode of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository;\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``pytest``;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with change;\n1. push your feature branch to (your fork of) the s2s repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request.\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n\n## You want to make a release\n\nIf you want to make a release, please follow the instructions in [the developer documentation](README.dev.md)."

This is how we like to structure our data for ML applications. \nWe define the \"anchor date\" to be between the target and precursor periods\n(strictly speaking, it is the start of the first target interval). All other\nintervals are expressed as offsets to this anchor date. Conveniently, this\neliminates any ambiguity related to leap years. \nFor convenience, Lilio offers a few shorthands for standard of calendars e.g.\n[`monthly_calendar`](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/lilio/calendar_shorthands/index.html#lilio.calendar_shorthands.monthly_calendar)\nand\n[`weekly_calendar`](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/lilio/calendar_shorthands/index.html#lilio.calendar_shorthands.weekly_calendar).\nHowever, you can also create custom calendars by calling\n[`Calendar`](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/lilio/calendar/index.html#lilio.calendar.Calendar)\ndirectly. For a nice walkthrough, see [this example\nnotebook](https://lilio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/all_about_the_calendar.html). \n"

        "description": "With this release, Lilio now supports a safe and greedy mode for creating intervals and can infer data frequency. For more details, see overview below:\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n - Moved to ruff formatter instead of black ([#70](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/70))\r\n - Do import sorting with ruff instead of isort ([#70](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/70))\r\n - Option for \"greedy\" mode which creates an interval if any data is available within the time bound ([#75](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/75))\r\n - `map_to_data` now tries to infer the time bounds for the data, and uses those to determine which anchor years are valid ([#75](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/75))\r\n - Tests for greedy and safe mode, including inferring data frequency ([#75](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/75))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n - Fixed issue with calendar generation when the (rightmost) target period crossed into the new year ([#70](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/70)).\r\n - Fixed issue with Pandas 2.2 where 'M' changed to 'ME' ([#72](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/72))\r\n - Fixed issue where pd.Interval now shows time where it is not wanted ([#72](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/72)). The issue was raised with Pandas ([#57748] https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57748).\r\n - Added tests for latest version of macos (with M1 chips) ([#73](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/73))\r\n - Fixed a bug in `map_to_data` that lead to anchor years being included when they should not have ([#75](https://github.com/AI4S2S/lilio/pull/75))",

        "description": "\r\n### Changed\r\n- `lilio.resample` will now return `xr.DataArray` if the input is `xr.DataArray`.\r\n- For compatibility with DataArray output, the Dataset/DataArray returned by resample now has the coordinates \"left_bound\" and \"right_bound\" instead of a single \"intervals\" coordinate with the \"bounds\" dimension.\r\n- If your input data has an frequency of less than _twice_ the Calendar's smallest interval length, a UserWarning will be raised.\r\n- If your input data has a frequency less than the Calendar's smallest interval length, a ValueError will be raised.\r\n- In the output of `resample()`, the column/coordinate `target` has been renamed to `is_target` to avoid clashing with a possibly commonly used name by users.\r\n- The input data into `resample()` is now checked for the existance of reserved names, such as \"anchor_year\" or \"i_interval\", to avoid overwriting these and cause unpredictable behavior.",

        "description": "First release of Lilio as a split off from `s2spy`.\r\n\r\nLilio generates calendars to resample timeseries into training and target data for machine learning.\r\nIt is named after [the inventor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloysius_Lilius) of the [Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar).\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fixed a bug in Matplotlib calendar visualization related to the anchor date.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- The `CustomCalendar` has been renamed to `Calendar`.\r\n- The `AdventCalendar`, `MonthlyCalendar` and `WeeklyCalendar` have been removed as classes. Instead there are functions that generate a standard `Calendar`.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Resampling now supports many methods (e.g. median, min, std) as well as user-defined functions.\r\n- A \"calendar shifter\" to create a list of staggered calendars.\r\n\r\n### Dev changes\r\n- Lilio makes use of ['hatch'](https://hatch.pypa.io/) now.\r\n  - Building the package has moved to hatchling\r\n  - Environments and scripts are set up to handle linting and docs building.\r\n- Ruff is now used as a linter.\r\n- Notebooks have been moved to the docs folder. Notebooks needs to be cleaned to pass the CI.\r\n",
