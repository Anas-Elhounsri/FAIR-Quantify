        "description": "gRPC (http://www.grpc.io/) server for Xenon (https://nlesc.github.io/Xenon/).\r\n\r\nCan be used to use Xenon in a non-java based language. For example pyxenon (https://github.com/NLeSC/pyxenon) uses the Xenon gRPC server.\r\n\r\nThe server tries to mimic the Xenon library API as much as possible, differences are described in the proto file (src/main/proto/xenon.proto).\r\n",
