Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation).\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n3. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``pytest``;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. push your feature branch to (your fork of) the dianna repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\nWe also have a [developer documentation chapter](https://dianna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_info.html) that you can use for reference.\n"

Our choices, based on the largest usage in scientific literature, are shown graphically in the XAI taxonomy below: \nThe key points of DIANNA: \n *   Provides an easy-to-use interface for non (X)AI experts\n *   Implements well-known XAI methods LIME, RISE and KernelSHAP, chosen by systematic and objective evaluation criteria\n *   Supports the de-facto standard of neural network models - ONNX\n *   Supports images, text, time series, and tabular data modalities, embeddings are currently being developed\n *   Comes with simple intuitive image, text, time series, and tabular benchmarks, so can help you with your XAI research\n *   Includes scientific use-cases tutorials\n *   Easily extendable to other XAI methods \n\nFor more information on the unique strengths of DIANNA with comparison to other tools, please see the [context landscape](https://dianna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTEXT.html).\n \n"

        "value": "**We work with ONNX!** ONNX is a great unified neural network standard which can be used to boost reproducible science. Using ONNX for your model also gives you a boost in performance! In case your models are still in another popular DNN (deep neural network) format, here are some simple recipes to convert them: \n* [pytorch and pytorch-lightning](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/blob/main/tutorials/conversion_onnx/pytorch2onnx.ipynb) - use the built-in [`torch.onnx.export`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/onnx.html) function to convert pytorch models to onnx, or call the built-in [`to_onnx`](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy/production_advanced.html) function on your [`LightningModule`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/latest/api/lightning.pytorch.core.LightningModule.html#lightning.pytorch.core.LightningModule) to export pytorch-lightning models to onnx.\n* [tensorflow](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/blob/main/tutorials/conversion_onnx/tensorflow2onnx.ipynb) - use the [`tf2onnx`](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) package to convert tensorflow models to onnx.\n* [keras](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/blob/main/tutorials/conversion_onnx/keras2onnx.ipynb) - same as the conversion from tensorflow to onnx, the [`tf2onnx`](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx) package also supports keras.\n* [scikit-learn](https://github.com/dianna-ai/dianna/blob/main/tutorials/conversion_onnx/skl2onnx.ipynb) - use the [`skl2onnx`](https://github.com/onnx/sklearn-onnx) package to scikit-learn models to onnx. \nMore converters with examples and tutorials can be found on the [ONNX tutorial page](https://github.com/onnx/tutorials). \nAnd here are links to notebooks showing how we created our models on the benchmark datasets: \n"
