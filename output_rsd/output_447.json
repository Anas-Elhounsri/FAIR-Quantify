Please read these guidelines and our [README.dev](https://github.com/TulipaEnergy/TulipaEnergyModel.jl/blob/main/README.dev.md) to get you started.\n\n## GitHub Rules of Engagement\n\n-   If you want to discuss something that isn't immediately actionable, post under Discussions. Convert it to an issue once it's actionable.\n-   All PR's should have an associated issue (unless it's a very minor fix).\n-   All issues should have 1 Type and 1+ Zone labels (unless Type: epic).\n-   Assign yourself to issues you want to address. Consider if you will be able to work on them in the near future (this week) \u2014 if not, leave them available for someone else.\n-   Set the issue Status to \"In Progress\" when you have started working on it.\n-   When finalizing a pull request, set the Status to \"Ready for Review.\" If someone specific needs to review it, assign them as the reviewer (otherwise anyone can review).\n-   Issues addressed by merged PRs will automatically move to Done.\n-   If you want to discuss an issue at the next group meeting (or just get some attention), mark it with the \"question\" label.\n-   Issues without updates for 60 days (and PRs without updates in 30 days) will be labelled as \"stale\" and filtered out of view. There is a Stale project board to view and revive these.\n\n## Contributing Workflow\n\nFork \u2192 Branch \u2192 Code \u2192 Push \u2192 Pull \u2192 Squash & Merge\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Create a new branch (in your fork)\n3. Do fantastic coding\n4. Push to your fork\n5. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository\n6. (After review) Squash and merge\n\nFor a step-by-step guide to these steps, see our [README.dev.md](https://github.com/TulipaEnergy/TulipaEnergyModel.jl/blob/main/README.dev.md).\n\nWe use this workflow in our quest to achieve the [Utopic Git History](https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/the-utopic-git-history-d44b81c09593).\n"
