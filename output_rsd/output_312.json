These data form the basis of comparison and sharing between health providers, regions and countries, and over periods. \nIn addition to this essential core function, the ICD can also inform a wide range of related activities. It is used for health insurance reimbursement; in national health programme management; by data collection specialists and researchers; for tracking progress in global health; and to determine the allocation of health resources. Patient quality and safety documentation is also heavily informed by the ICD. \nThe ICD system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of health statistics, and health information in general. Currently, 117 countries report causes of death to WHO. Seventy per cent of the world\u2019s health resources are allocated based on ICD data. Current uses include cancer registration, pharmacovigilance, and more than 20,000 scientific articles cite ICD-10. \nFor further details about the ICD, please consider to read the [References](#References).\n \n"

For each code set, it endeavors to answer this question: Taking the complete meaning of a code (defined as: all correctly coded conditions or procedures that would be classified to a code based on the code title, all associated tabular instructional notes, and all index references that refer to a code) as a single unit, what are the most appropriate translation(s) to the other code set? \n"

        "value": "Let us showcase the features of the package.\n\nFirst, we import the necessary packages:\n\n```julia\nusing ICD_GEMs\n```\n\nThe GEMs converting ICD-10 codes into ICD-9 and viceversa have already been downloaded from [here](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/ICD10CM/2018/Dxgem_2018.zip) and exported both as `DataFrame` s from [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) and `OrderedDict`s from [DataStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl):\n\n- `GEM_I10_I9_dataframe`:  GEM from ICD-10 to ICD-9 represented as a dataframe;\n- `GEM_I10_I9_dictionary`:  GEM from ICD-10 to ICD-9 represented as a dictionary;\n- `GEM_I9_I10_dataframe`:  GEM from ICD-9 to ICD-10 represented as a dataframe;\n- `GEM_I9_I10_dictionary`:  GEM from ICD-10 to ICD-9 represented as a dictionary.\n\nThese are all `GEM` structs consisting of two fields:\n\n- `data`: The actual GEM, which may either be a dataframe or a dictionary;\n- `direction`: A string, either `\"I10_I9\"` or `\"I9_I10\"`.\n\nThe package can be used with custom GEMs (or \"applied mappings\") as long as they are wrapped inside a `GEM` struct where the `data` field is either a dataframe or a dictionary with the exact same format as the exported ones above. If some new GEMs are released by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/Comprehensive-Listing-of-ICD-10-CM-Files.htm), the functions that load CDC-formatted .txt files are exported:\n\n```julia\npath      = \"path/to/txt\"\ndirection = \"I10_I9\" # If the GEM translates from ICD-10 to ICD-9, otherwise \"I9_I10\"\ngem       = get_GEM_dataframe_from_cdc_gem_txt(path, direction) # Or get_GEM_dictionary_from_cdc_gem_txt(path, direction)\n```\n\nFinally, let us show how to translate ICD-10 codes into ICD-9 for, as an example, neoplasms:\n\n```julia\nICD_10_neoplasms = \"C00-D48\" # This is equivalent as explicitly specifying all codes from C00.XX to D48.XX\nICD_9_neoplasm   = execute_applied_mapping(GEM_I10_I9_dictionary, [\"C00-D48\"])  \n```\n\n```nothing\n932-element Vector{String}:\n \"1400\"\n \"1401\"\n \"1409\"\n \"1403\"\n \"1404\"\n \"1405\"\n \"1406\"\n \"1408\"\n \"1410\"\n \u22ee\n \"23877\"\n \"2380\"\n \"2381\"\n \"2354\"\n \"2382\"\n \"2383\"\n \"2388\"\n \"2389\"\n```\n\nAnd back:\n\n```julia\nICD_10_neoplasm_back   = execute_applied_mapping(GEM_I9_I10_dictionary, ICD_9_neoplasm)\n```\n\n```nothing\n1186-element Vector{String}:\n \"C000\"\n \"C001\"\n \"C002\"\n \"C003\"\n \"C004\"\n \"C005\"\n \"C006\"\n \"C008\"\n \"C01\"\n \u22ee\n \"D480\"\n \"D481\"\n \"D483\"\n \"D484\"\n \"D485\"\n \"D4860\"\n \"D487\"\n \"D489\"\n```\n\nAre these the same as all the codes we started from, namely all ICD-10 codes from the first starting with `C00` to the last that starts with `D48` ? These would be:\n\n```julia\nget_ICD_code_range(\"C00-D48\", \"ICD-10\") # Specify a code range and the revision it belongs to\n```\n\n```nothing\n1622-element Vector{String}:\n \"C000\"\n \"C001\"\n \"C002\"\n \"C003\"\n \"C004\"\n \"C005\"\n \"C006\"\n \"C008\"\n \"C009\"\n \u22ee\n \"D483\"\n \"D484\"\n \"D485\"\n \"D4860\"\n \"D4861\"\n \"D4862\"\n \"D487\"\n \"D489\"\n```\n\nNo, they are more! Why? Because the mapping between the two revisions is not injective nor surjective (see the [official documentation](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/ICD_GEMs.jl/tree/main/official_gem_documentation)). \n\nMore complex translations, involving both single codes and ranges with arbitrary precision on both ends, can be performed:\n\n```julia\nexecute_applied_mapping(GEM_I10_I9_dictionary, [\"I60-I661\", \"I670\", \"I672-I679\"])\n```\n\n**Note**: All codes must be specified and are returned by the translation utilities without punctuation (no dot before the decimal digits).\n"
