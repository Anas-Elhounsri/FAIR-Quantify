If you're trying *GEMDAT* with your data, your experience, questions, bugs you encountered, and suggestions for improvement are important to the success of the project.\n\nWe have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n## Questions, feedback, bugs\n\nUse the search function to see if someone else already ran accross the same issue. Feel free to open a new [issue here](https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT/issues) to ask a question, suggest improvements/new features, or report any bugs that you ran into.\n\n## Submitting changes\n\nEven better than a good bug report is a fix for the bug or the implementation of a new feature. We welcome any contributions that help improve the code.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an [issue](https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT/issues) with the owners of this repository before making a change.\n\nContributions can come in the form of:\n\n- Bug fixes\n- New features\n- Improvement of existing code\n- Updates to the documentation\n- ... ?\n\nWe use the usual GitHub pull-request flow. For more info see [GitHub's own documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nTypically this means:\n\n1. [Forking](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-forks) the repository and/or make a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-branches)\n2. Making your changes\n3. Make sure that the tests pass and add your own\n4. Update the documentation is updated for new features\n5. Pushing the code back to Github\n6. [Create a new Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n\nOne of the code owners will review your code and request changes if needed. Once your changes have been approved, your contributions will become part of *GEMDAT*. \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Getting started with development\n\n### Setup\n\n*GEMDAT* targets Python 3.10 or newer.\n\nClone the repository into the `gemdat` directory:\n\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT gemdat\n```\n\nInstall using `virtualenv`:\n\n```console\ncd gemdat\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npython3 -m pip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\nAlternatively, install using Conda:\n\n```console\ncd gemdat\nconda create -n gemdat python=3.10\nconda activate gemdat\npip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nGEMDAT uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the tests. You can run the tests for yourself using:\n\n```console\npytest\n```\n\nTo check coverage:\n\n```console\ncoverage run -m pytest\ncoverage report  # to output to terminal\ncoverage html    # to generate html report\n```\n\n### Building the documentation\n\nThe documentation is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the pages.\n\nTo build the documentation for yourself:\n\n```console\npip install -e .[docs]\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\nYou can find the documentation source in the [docs](https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT/tree/main/docs) directory.\nIf you are adding new pages, make sure to update the listing in the [`mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) under the `nav` entry.\n\n### Making a release\n\n1. Make a new [release](https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT/releases).\n\n2. Under 'Choose a tag', set the tag to the new version. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/), so bump the version (*major*/*minor*/*patch*) as needed. Bumping the version is handled transparently by `bumpversion` in [this workflow](https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n3. The [upload to pypi](https://pypi.org/project/gemdat) is triggered when a release is published and handled by [this workflow](https://github.com/GEMDAT-repos/GEMDAT/actions/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n4. The [upload to zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8401669) is triggered when a release is published.\n"
