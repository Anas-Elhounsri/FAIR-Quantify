Support requests should be sent to:\n\n* [the umple-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/umple-dev)\n\nWe do our best to keep the issue tracker tidy and organized, making it useful\nfor everyone. For example, we classify open issues per application and perceived\ndifficulty of the issue, making it easier for developers to\n[contribute to Umple](#contributing).\n\n## Bug reports\n\nA bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.\nGood bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!\n\nGuidelines for bug reports:\n\n1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; [check if the issue has already been\n   reported](https://github.com/umple/umple/search?type=Issues).\n\n2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the\n   `master` branch in the repository.\n\n3. **Isolate and report the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test\n   case.\n\nPlease try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include information about\nyour Operating System and the version of the compiler you are using. Please make sure you are using the latest version of Umple. Please provide steps to\nreproduce the issue as well as the outcome you were expecting! All these details\nwill help developers to fix any potential bugs.\n\nExample:\n\n> Short and descriptive example bug report title\n>\n> A summary of the issue and the environment in which it occurs. If suitable,\n> include the steps required to reproduce the bug.\n>\n> 1. This is the first step\n> 2. This is the second step\n> 3. Further steps, etc.\n>\n> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case (e.g. a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), or [UmpleOnline](https://try.umple.org))\n>\n> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being\n> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as\n> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their\n> merits).\n\n## Feature requests\n\nFeature requests are welcome. Take a moment to find\nout whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you*\nto make a strong case to convince the community of the merits of this feature.\nPlease provide as much detail and context as possible.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease help us tackle\nexisting issues! To do so, there are a few things you need to know\nabout the code.\n\nThe umple project is split into many smaller subproject, the folder hierarchy is explained below to better describe the structure.\n\n* `build` - All build related scripts\n\n* `cruise.umple` - Umple compiler, containers it's own ReadMe.txt, as well as `UmpleTo*` below\n\n* `cruise.umple.eclipse` - *Eclipse plugins*\n\n* `cruise.umplificator` - *Converting outside code to Umple*\n\n* `cruise.umple.validator` - Used by `cruise.umplificator` for validating an umplified project\n\n* `cruise.umple.nebula` - Infrastructure used for real-time C++\n\n* `dev-tools` - Tooling for Umple developers\n\n* `dist` - Contents are not pushed to the repository, and only available after building\n  * libs/ *Managed build dependencies that umple*.jar require to run*\n  * cruise.umple/reference *User manual*\n  * qa/ *Test reports*\n  * umple.jar *Command-line Compiler* (a symbolic link to the latest version\n  * umpledocs.n.n.jar *User manual generator*\n  * umplestats.n.n.jar *Statistics generation*\n  * umplesync.n.n.jar *UmpleOnline tool to to synchronize graphical form*\n  * vml.b.b.jar * Extension for variability modeling*\n\n* `examples` - Developer curated examples\n* `externalexamples` - External projects that are used for testing\n\n* `ExternalTextEditorPlugins` - Plugins for external editors, Notepad++, etc\n\n* `sandbox` - A sample project for testing Continuous Integration server\n\n* `testbed` - Test suites for Umple generated Java\n* `testbest_ruby` - Test suites for Umple generated Ruby\n* `testbest_php` - Test suites for Umple generated PHP\n\n* `UmpleToJava` - Code generation for Java*\n\n* `UmpleToPhp` - Code generation for Php*\n\n* `UmpleToRuby` - Code generation for Ruby*\n\n* `UmpleToRTCpp` - Code generation for C++ *\n\n* `UmpleToSDL` - Code generation to convert Umple to SDL*\n\n* `UmpleToSql` - Code generation SQL from Umple models*\n\n* `UmpleToTemplate` - Template for creating new code generation subprojects*\n\n* `umpleonline` - The UmpleOnline web application\n  * UmpleOnline allows generation of code from Umple directly in a web browser, and also editing of Umple both graphically and textually. Available at https://try.umple.org\n\n* `Umplificator` - Reverse engineer code to Umple\n\n* `umplificatoronline` - Online tool for converting code to Umple\n\n* `umpleUI` - Projects for the UIGU tooling\n  * Projects for generating a UI through UIGU from Umple. These need work to incorporate them into UmpleOnline\n\n* `umplewww` - Core files from the Umple.org web pages\n  * Includes items such as the user manual that are moved at build time into the appropriate place\n\nYou will want to ensure you have a [proper development environment](https://github.com/umple/umple/wiki/DevelopmentSetUp),\nand that you are familiar with running the build using our [build cheat sheet](https://github.com/umple/umple/wiki/CheatSheet)\n\nAfter your changes are done, please remember to run the full suite with\n`cd build && ant -Dmyenv=local`.\n\nYou can check [the build status on Jenkins](https://jenkins.umple.org).\n\nWith tests running and passing, you are ready to contribute to Umple and\nsend your pull requests.\n\n## Pull requests\n\nGood pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic\nhelp. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated\ncommits.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree that your work will be\nlicensed under the license used by the project.\n\nIf you have any large pull request in mind (e.g. implementing features,\nrefactoring code, etc), **please ask first** otherwise you risk spending\na lot of time working on something that the project's developers might\nnot want to merge into the project.\n\nPlease adhere to the coding conventions in the project (indentation,\naccurate comments, etc.) and don't forget to add your own tests and\ndocumentation. When working with Git, we recommend the following process\nin order to craft an excellent pull request:\n\n1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,\n  and configure the remotes:\n\n  ```sh\n  # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\n  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/umple\n  # Navigate to the newly cloned directory\n  cd umple\n  # Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\n  git remote add upstream https://github.com/umple/umple\n  ```\n\n2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:\n\n  ```sh\n  git checkout master\n  git pull upstream master\n  ```\n\n3. Create a new topic branch (off of `master`) to contain your feature, change,\n  or fix.\n\n  **IMPORTANT**: Making changes in `master` is discouraged. You should always\n  keep your local `master` in sync with upstream `master` and make your\n  changes in topic branches.\n\n  ```sh\n  git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>\n  ```\n\n4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Keep your commit messages organized,\n  with a short description in the first line and more detailed information on\n  the following lines. Feel free to use Git's\n  [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)\n  feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.\n\n5. Make sure all the tests are still passing.\n\n  ```sh\n  cd build \n  ant Dmyenv=local\n  ```\n  Don't forget to use ant -Dmyenv=wlocal if you're on Windows.\n\n  This command will compile the code in your branch and use that\n  version of Umple to run the tests. This is needed to ensure your changes can\n  pass all the tests.\n\n6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:\n\n  ```sh\n  git push origin <topic-branch-name>\n  ```\n\n7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)\n  with a clear title and description.\n\n8. If you haven't updated your pull request for a while, you should consider\n  rebasing on master and resolving any conflicts.\n\n  **IMPORTANT**: _Never ever_ merge upstream `master` into your branches. You\n  should always `git rebase` on `master` to bring your changes up to date when\n  necessary.\n\n  ```sh\n  git checkout master\n  git pull upstream master\n  git checkout <your-topic-branch>\n  git rebase master\n  ```\n\nThank you for your contributions!\n"

Issue #2093 PRs #2097 #2135\r\n\r\n\r\nJson Persistence: Ability to generate code in any class so instances can export a JSON representation of that object and the entire network of connected objects, and also to deserialize too. This enables one form of persistence. It works better than GSON and similar solutions since it solve problems with circularity of references, which are inherent in Umple-generated code.

        "description": "Umple release 1.33.0 contains all changes made from late December 2022 to January 10th 2024.\r\n\r\nChanges in this release include the following. These were all worked on by either Masters or 4th year students at the University of Ottawa.\r\n\r\nUmpleOnline improvements:\r\n\r\n - Issue #1898 and #1958 and PR #2035: Menus to allow GraphViz diagrams to be edited. In a class diagram: Right-clicking (control-clicking on a Mac) on a class allows renaming or deleting a class, adding an attribute, association or subclass, or changing the colour. In a state diagram, right-clicking on a state allows renaming or deleting the state, as well as adding a substate or transition.\r\n \r\n - Issue #1897: In a state diagram, clicking on a state will highlight its code in the text pane (this functionality previously existed only for class diagrams).\r\n \r\n\r\nGenerator improvements:\r\n\r\n  Python generation (transpiling) improvements: (Issuer #1994)\r\n - PR #2034: Implementing nested classes, timing and concurrency\r\n - PR #2072: Outputting comments from Umple to Python code\r\n - PRs #2074 and #2075: Fixing generation of tabs with Python code in UmpleOnline\r\n - PR #2077: Bringing python out of beta mode\r\n (more work on fine-tuning Python generation and allowing execution in UmpleOnline are planned for the coming year)\r\n \r\n - Issue #2015 and PR #2067: Ability to generate GraphViz diagrams of state machines and class diagrams that are more spread apart (or more dense). The new -s gvseparator takes an argument greater than or less than 1.\r\n\r\n - Issue #2052 and PR #2065: Certain errors when specifying requirements now generate a proper Umple warning, rather than printing to Standard Output (more work on Requirements modeling will be done for the next release)\r\n \r\n - Issue #511 and PR #2058: The colour of states in a state diagram can now be specified in the same manner as for classes and interfaces in a class diagram ising the displayColor (also displayColour) directive. Any html-compatible colour can be used, either words or hex.\r\n \r\n - PR #2050: State tables and event sequences can now be generated on the command line, and not just in UmpleOnline\r\n \r\n - PR #2030. Beta Lezer generator of the umple grammar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n - PR #2073: Fixing an XSS security issue in UmpleOnline\r\n\r\n - Issue #1904 and PR #2068: Fixed Null pointer exception when generating SQL in certain situations\r\n\r\n - Issue #2023 and PRs #2057, #2049 and #2064.: Fixed the situation where extraneous brackets would terminate parsing, and result in all subsequent code being ignored. Warning 1016 will now be raised, and the parser will still process code following the extraneous bracket (curly bracket or regular parenthsis found at the top level of the model). This had been causing some model elements to silently 'disappear', unknown to the programmers.\r\n \r\n - Issue #2056 and PR #2060: Improved syntactic processing of the 'displayColour' directive to prevent inaccurate error messages.\r\n \r\n - Issue #2051 and PR #2065: Fixed crash when an implementedReq statement did not have a matching req statement\r\n \r\n - Issue #2046 and PR #2055: Fixed 'unique immutable' combination of attribute stereotypes.\r\n\r\n - Issue #2040 and PR #2042: Fixed a compiler analysis failure in a certain case\r\n \r\n - PR #2069: Dealing with countlog resets in UmpleOnline (it was getting reset to zero at random times)\r\n \r\n - PR #2022: Suppressing a deprecation warning (this means we are stuck at Java 17 for now).\r\n \r\n\r\nImprovements for those developing Umple\r\n\r\n - Issue #2048 and PR #2061: Created Dev Tools for Windows users of Umple (in dev-tools-windows ... there were already tools for Mac and Linux in the dev-tools directory)\r\n \r\n - PR #2041: New dev tools for generating diagrams on the command line.\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\r\n - PR #2062. Adding contributors to the license, and updating web links to use the pattern umple.org/option rather than option.umple.org (this was for security reasons). Key URLs https://try.umple.org and https://manual.umple.org can still be used, however.  Some preliminary work is released in PR #2043.\r\n \r\n - Dependency adjustments for the the code execution feature: #2057, #2038, #2039, #2036, #2033\r\n\r\n - PR #2030 Server ping capability ... prevents counting a command in logs when the internal server is simply pinged to see if it is alive.\r\n \r\n\r\nPreparation work for collaboration feature:\r\n\r\n - PR #2019 Updated Codemirror from version 2 to version 5.\r\n\r\n - Issue: #1963: UmpleOnline can be used collaboratively: Multiple people can edit at the same time. This is not being fully released yet since there are some glitches still. However it is available for beta testing in PR #2029 and branch 1963-add-codemirror6. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomated Continuous Integration testing is performed on a combination of Appveyor (Windows) and Jenkins (jenkins.umple.org, for ubuntu Linux, which we self-host)\r\n\r\nEach Umple release has a DOI associated with it to allow citations.

        "description": "Umple release 1.31.1 contains all changes from July 9th 2021 to August 18th 2021\r\n\r\nThis is the mid-summer release; one more release is expected in September with additional summer work.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n\r\nAdding automated UI tests to UmpleOnline that can be run through jenkins.umple.org; this should help prevent regressions in the UX. Tests are run in headless Chrome. #1836 for issue #363 (this had been worked on since 2016)\r\n\r\nAdding a generator to refactor annotative to compositional mixsets #1815\r\n\r\nAdding a user manual page documenting all Umple keywords #1799 and #1809 for issue #166\r\n\r\nGenerating proper SQL code for generalizations #1800 for issue #1728\r\n\r\nImprovements to the command line compiler\r\n\r\n - A generator called 'Nothing' that can be used after the -g option to create no output, but allow Umple models to be analyzed (linted) for errors and warnings #1808\r\n \r\n - An option -u to allow Umple code to be specified on the command line directly (rather than in a file). This can be useful to quickly test a very small model, or to quickly create a standalone diagram. #1804\r\n \r\n - The ability to generate svg files directly if graphviz (dot) is installed using the -c - option from any generator starting Gv #1844\r\n \r\nImproving full build by having it emit fewer messages and warnings, and fail correctly in Gradle. #1795 #1802 #1806 #1807   \r\n\r\nImproving accessibility by making elements of UmpleOnline focusable using the keyboard #1837\r\n\r\nAdding testbed tests for Compositions and Association Specializations #1796 for issue #1254\r\n\r\nVarious bug fixes and UX improvements\r\n\r\n - Fixing an infinite loop in structure diagram svg generation #1838\r\n\r\n - Fixing a situation where the diagram would not update when it was completely replaced or certain parts of the text were deleted # 1841 for issues #1835 and #1757\r\n\r\n - Fixing state machine diagram scaling problems #1834 and #1833 for issues #1619 #1754 and #1753\r\n\r\n - Fixing a bug in feature diagram generation #1832 for issue #1827\r\n\r\n - Other minor glitches: #1830 for issue #1826; #1831 for issue #1823\r\n \r\n - Certain Grapviz generators now respect the --path option (specifying where output is to be placed) when they ignored it before. #1844\r\n\r\nSeveral other internal cleanups. #1840 #1842 #1843\r\n\r\nAutomated Continuous Integration testing is now done on a combination of Appveyor (Windows) and Jenkins (jenkins.umple.org, for ubuntu Linux, which we self-host)\r\n\r\nEach Umple release now has a DOI associated with it to allow citations.

        "description": "Umple release 1.31.0 contains all changes from April 9th 2021 to July 9th 2021\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most significant Umple releases in a couple of years. The changes include important improvements to end-user experience (of those developing with Umple) and the experience of those developing Umple itself.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n\r\nMajor refactoring of the source code structure of the Umple compiler (its .ump files in cruise.umple/src) to improve understandability, enable product-line creation and variants using mixsets, and simplifying some files. PRs involved in this include #1678, #1679, #1680, #1681, #1682, #1685, #1686, #1687, #1688. #1694, #1706, #1711, #1714, #1718, #1730, #1736, #1738, #1748, #1761, #1763. This work is by PhD student Abdulaziz Algablan @gublan24\r\n\r\nNatural language descriptions of associations now appears in the GraphViz class diagrams in UmpleOnline. Hover over either end of an association to see the information pop up. PR #1683. This helps users better understand models.\r\n\r\nImprovements to tooltips in various places in UmpleOnline to help users understand the interface #1689, #1708, #1731, #1768, #1772, #1779, #1782\r\n\r\nA new 'Tip of the day' feature added to provide users with some insights into things they can do with Umple. A message appears at the top of UmpleOnline if there is not urgent message from the system. PRs #1696, #1707 for issue #1636 More tips will be added in the future.\r\n\r\nImprovements to tasks, such as being able to cancel the task creation process. PR #1715 for issue #1697\r\n\r\nThe 'generate' menu in UmpleOnline now keeps the same target (e.g. Java, PhP, State Table), when loading a new example. This allows easier comparing of outputs from the examples. PR #1729\r\n\r\nIntroduction of a capability to survey random users about their experience with UmpleOnline PRs #1735 and #1774 for issue #1695. This will help us gather information to further improve Umple. Surveys will only be discretely prompted after a user has worked with Umple for a while and done a non-trivial amount of editing, and if the user accepts to answer the short survey, it will appear in a separate tab so as not to disrupt work. UOttawa ethics approval was obtained to enable this.\r\n\r\nSmall changes to colours in UmpleOnline to improve user experience and readability PR #1737\r\n\r\nOpening Yuml in a separate tab PR #1739\r\n\r\nImprovements to JSON generation to make it more readable PR #1740\r\n\r\nThe latest version of JQuery has been incorporated. PRs #1771 and #1778\r\n\r\nBug fixes, including\r\n\r\n - improvements to loading tasks #1713\r\n - removal of invalid show/hide button in some cases #1732\r\n - proper counting of edits in UmpleOnline #1766 for issue #1747\r\n - fixing glitches when resizing the UmpleOnline window #1777 for issue #1663\r\n - removing an inactive copy-to-clipboard icon #1781\r\n - ensuring the URL for a displayed example doesn't disappear too soon #1785\r\n - Fixes to joint.js that had caused a hang PRS #1787 and #1789 for issue #1786\r\n - fixing a stack overflow crash in SQL generation PR #1788 for issue #1767\r\n\r\nThe VML jar (an old alternative compiler) and its webpage have been removed since the features have been subsumed into the Mixsets capability of Umple. #1746\r\n\r\nThere have been many improvements to the Umple command line compiler options (run the umple.jar with --help to see full details). Improvements include\r\n - allowing a sequence of compilations to be done at once, as specified in a file that lists sets of Umple files and/or mixsets one per line\r\n - internal compilation of Java when the -c option is used (to speed up compilation, although this increases the size of the compiler jar). #1780.\r\nThe above are used internally in the manual and example tests to speed up the build considerably PR #1784.\r\n\r\nImprovements to the build process, including better building and testing with Gradle (issue #1609), PRs #1716, #1762, #1773. The Gradle build is now the default build in the new Jenkins CI server, although the ant build is still available and is used in Appveyor\r\n\r\nAutomated user interface tests, which had been previously developed have now been further polished. PR #1783 for issue #363 Further work on these will be ongoing. To run these tests from the build directory:- \r\n - gem install rspec capybara cuprite selenium-webdriver\r\n - ant -f build.websitetests.xml \"-DhostName=http://cruise.local/umpleonline/\" doWebsiteTests\r\n(where the hostname is your own host)\r\n\r\nVarious updates to the umple website including #1776\r\n\r\nEach Umple release now has a DOI associated with it to allow citations. A badge appears in the Github main page for Umple.\r\n\r\nThe umple-n.n.n-rrrr-hhhhhhhh,jar is the command line compiler\r\n\r\nWhen you do a build in ant, a symbolic link is made on linux and mac calling this umple.jar in the dist directory.

Any void method can have its signature marked as 'queued'. The call will then be put on a queue to be executed in a second thread, and the calling thread will be able to continue without delay. This can be useful for enabling secondary calculations that are not needed immediately, or sending asynchronous messages where there is a desire not to wait for the response.\r\n\r\nThe alpha version of the CRUD user interface generator has been made available after some bug fixing. It is intended that this be completed for the next major release.\r\n\r\nThe alpha version of a new Test-Driven Modeling framework (PhD thesis work of Sultan Eid). This includes a new UmpleTestLangauge abstract language that is like xUnit except that it is independent of target language. There is also a compiler for this that generates jUnit, phpUnit etc. It is also possible to embed tests directly in an Umple model.\r\n\r\nImprovements to the user manual, in particular better documenting mixsets, constraints the distributed feature\r\n\r\nAdding testing of generated php from all relevant examples.\r\n\r\nVarious bugs were fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee\r\nhttps://github.com/umple/umple/milestone/2?closed=1 for the pull requests completed in this milestone release\r\n\r\nThe umple-n.n.n-rrrr-hhhhhhhh,jar is the command line compiler\r\nWhen you do a build a symbolic link is made on linux and mac calling this umple.jar in the dist directory.

        "description": "Release notes for Umple release 1.24.0\n\nThis contains all updates to early March 22 2016. The following are the key changes:\n\nThis release is essentially identical to release 1.23.1, except for internal changes: Umple Java generation now is\nbased on UmpleTL templates instead of using Jet templates. Building Umple is now no longer dependent on Jet, and all Jet templates have been deleted, as have the generated code from the jet templates. That is simply regenerated now as needed.\n\nUsers should see no difference in syntax or semantics between 1.23.1 and 1.24.0. There may be slight changes in compilation speed.\n\nFor other recent changes, see the release notes for release 1.23.1 \n\nThe Jars are as follows:\n\nThe umple-n.n.n.n.jar is the command line compiler\nWhen you do a build a symbolic link is made on linux and mac calling this umple.jar in the dist directory\n\nThe cruise.umple.eclipse-n.n.n.n jar is the Eclipse plugin. Drop this in your plugins folder in the Modeling Languages version of Eclipse.\nNote: This release does not initially have the Eclipse plugin. This will be updated in a subrelease.\n\nWhen you build Umple, you will also generate other jars including umpledocs, to create the user manual; umplerun, a special tool for simulation, umplesync, an extended compiler used by Umpleonline and umplevml, a legacy (deprecated but still working) tool for product lines (key capabilities will be merged eventually into the main compiler)\n\nFor details on how to install see http://dl.umple.org\n",

The following are the key changes:\n\nUmple is now continuously built and tested on Appveyor for WIndows, as well as (as before) both on Travis and (as before) at the University of Ottawa (cc.umple.org).\n\nImprovements to UmpleTL (Template language)\n\nConversion of generation templates from Jet to UmpleTL in the PhP and Jet converters.\n\nThis is the final release in which generation of Java and hence the compiler itself is being performed using Jet. Immediately following this, there will be another release 1.24.0 which will see activation of Java generation in UmpleTL, and deletion of all Jet templates. The main purpose of this release is to have a baseline and the ability to easily compare the two compilers, based on different technologies.\n\nRemoval of the original incomplete Cpp generator ... the RTCpp generator is now the only one.\n\nMany improvements to Traits, particularly improvements to state machines in traits (V.

        "description": "Release notes for Umple release 1.23.0\n\nThis contains all updates to December 21, 2015. The following are the key changes:\n\nSince the last official release (1.22.0, Feb 24 2015) Umple's hosting has moved from Google Code to Github\nand source control moved from svn to git. This has resulted in many changes to the structure of\nthe repository and the build process. In particular 1) binaries and dependencies are no longer\nbeing stored and version controlled directly in the repository, but are obtained externally during\neach build. Those building from scratch need to compile with 'first-build' the first time to ensure they download certain files..\nAmong the dependencies loaded during is the latest jar of Umple itself (since Umple\nis used to build itself). This is obtained from the most recent continuous build at the University of\nOttawa. However Umple can still be subsequently built locally without an Internet connection, as the\ndependencies are cached in the dist directory (which is not version controlled).\n\nUmple is now continuously built and tested both on Travis and (as before) at the University of Ottawa (cc.umple.org).\n\nIssue numbers changed when we moved to github, so references to issues in previous release notes need to take this into account.\n\nThe most important compiler and user interface changes in 1.23.0 (as compared to 1.22.0) are listed below. Most of the work has been by thesis students (names mentioned below) or UCOSP students.\n- Many improvements to Traits, particularly the ability to specify state machines in traits, and to merge state machines using traits (V. Abdelzad ongoing thesis work)\n- Improvements in formal method generation, particularly a re-doing of nuXmv generation. Both nuXmv and Alloy can both be generated to allow analysis of models (O. Adesina ongoing thesis work)\n- A variety of improvements to the Umple model-level tracing capability (trace and tracer keywords; H. Aljamaan's completed thesis work)\n- Adjustments to the umplificator (M. Garzon completed thesis work)\n- Improving the ability to specify filters with the notation filter X {include Class1, Class2; } and filter { includeFilter X; } This is useful for drawing focused diagrams.\n- Additional work on SCXML (Statechart XML)\n- In Umpleonline, it is now possible to request that generated code be split into separate tabs, one per file. For many people, this might be the preferred default, but the original mode (concatenating the files) is still useful as it allows browser-based global searching of names in the original Umple and the resulting generated code.\n- Diagrams now show italics for abstract in diagrams\n- A suite of graph walking algorithms to enable easier analysis of models.\n- Bug fixes related to generated code in PhP\n- Bug fixes related to warning messages associated with keys\n- Colouring in state tables\n- Various other minor bug fixes.\n\nThe Jars are as follows:\n\nThe umple-n.n.n.n.jar is the command line compiler\nWhen you do a build a symbolic link is made calling this umple.jar in the dist directory\n\nThe cruise.umple.eclipse-n.n.n.n jar is the Eclipse plugin. Drop this in your plugins folder in the Modeling Languages version of Eclipse.\nNote: This release does not initially have the Eclipse plugin. This will be updated in a subrelease.\n\nWhen you build Umple, you will also generate other jars including umpledocs, to create the user manual; umplerun, a special tool for simulation, umplesync, an extended compiler used by Umpleonline and umplevml, a legacy (deprecated but still working) tool for product lines (key capabilities will be merged soon into the main compiler)\n\nFor details on how to install see http://dl.umple.org\n",
