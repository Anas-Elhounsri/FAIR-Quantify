        "description": "#### Version 6.3.0 Released 2023-01-26\r\n\r\n(Nearly a full year since the previous release! The diff is 19,773 lines long!)\r\n\r\nUser support and user interface improvements:\r\n\r\n* The S3 DataProvider class has been extended to fully support the\r\n  browse_path feature, allowing files to be registered at arbitrary\r\n  depth within the object namespace tree of the S3 bucket.\r\n* The launch button in the file manager was improved so that external\r\n  sites can directly link to a prepared pair of dataset/tool. Used\r\n  by the CONP project, mostly.\r\n* We added the standard 'This site use a cookie' banner.\r\n* The globally visible list of available tools and datasets was\r\n  cleaned up and re-arranged in two tabs, each with two tables for\r\n  the public and restricted thingies.\r\n* Added a new userfile model in the base distribution: ZipArchive.\r\n* Special API hooks for the LORIS projects were adjusted; although\r\n  they can also be used by non LORIS actors, they're pretty specific.\r\n\r\nAdmin and codebase improvements:\r\n\r\n* A new type of user called an 'AutomatedUser' has been added; it\r\n  is basically the same as a NormalUser, but the type can help admins\r\n  identify accounts that are meant to be accessed by automated\r\n  systems (API calls etc).\r\n* A DataUsage model was added to track and count how often files\r\n  are being downloaded, copied, used in processing, or viewed. Admins\r\n  can selectively enable this on a project by project basis, and\r\n  counts are aggregated on a user + month-by-month basis.\r\n* A DiskQuota model was added, it allows administrator to impose\r\n  limits on the number of files and their total sizes for any user\r\n  on any data provider.\r\n* The communication channels between the portal and the bourreau\r\n  are now completely performed by setting up UNIX-domain sockets\r\n  on the Bourreau side. No longer do we open a network port on\r\n  localhost! The connections are established by proper -L and -R\r\n  SSH options, which now support such sockets.\r\n* A new rake task help developers and admins manage their CBRAIN\r\n  instances (cbrain:models:broken:*)\r\n* The boot mechanism for Bourreau was rewritten as plain bash shell\r\n  wrappers to allow a faster startup than then old Ruby bootstrapping\r\n  code. The Bourreau is still in Ruby, of course, but prepping it\r\n  up no longer requires a costly initial Ruby setup script.\r\n* Speaking of the boot system, Bourreaux servers now launch a\r\n  separate watchdog process (also a bash script) that will ping the\r\n  Bourreau every 20 minutes and force it to shutdown if the DB\r\n  connection (or any SSH tunnel) is shut down unexpectedly. This\r\n  keep the PID file from staying around for no reason.\r\n* We removed from the GitHub-hosted codebase the hardcoded cookie\r\n  secret keys; these were never really a security issue (given in\r\n  'production' mode the admin was supposed to create them), but for\r\n  convenience now any true production or development CBRAIN system\r\n  will generate their own secret key deterministically (yet in a\r\n  non-guessable way).\r\n* Admins can force specific users to not only link their account\r\n  to a GlobusAuth provider, it can also be a specific provider chosen\r\n  by the admin. And once the linkage is done, the password method\r\n  is permanently disabled for such users.\r\n* We cleaned up a bunch of system attributes that are no longer\r\n  used (like port numbers for DB and ActiveResource connections to\r\n  Bourreaux, which are now always tunnelled through SSH)\r\n* Admins users have access to the new 'last' command in the console,\r\n  and the 'p' (ping) command in the ibc interface.\r\n* Support for Apptainer as the new Singularity engine.\r\n* Bourreaux can be configured to log to an external file some\r\n  information about each job submitted (user, jobid, name, user\r\n  Globus name, etc).\r\n* When configuring a ToolConfig, the admin no longer has to explicitely\r\n  duplicate the environment variables that the tool needs depending\r\n  on whether the tools runs in Singularity/Apptainer or not. Before,\r\n  the admins had to set both XYZ=a and SINGULARITYENV_XYZ=a, now\r\n  it's done automatically.\r\n* Admins can now visualize directly in the interface the Boutiques\r\n  descriptor associated with a particular ToolConfig, for a tool\r\n  configured with the new integrator.\r\n* We cleaned up (removed) most of the controller actions that were\r\n  required by the Canadian agency that initially funded CBRAIN (CANARIE).\r\n  These were being monitored by them but they discontinued their\r\n  side.\r\n* Admins can create notification messages that will show up in the\r\n  dashboard of all users (e.g. notice for downtime etc)\r\n\r\nBoutiques improvements:\r\n\r\n* The (relatively) new Boutiques integrator has been extended with lots\r\n  of modules to let integrators customize the behavior of their tools:\r\n  * BoutiquesAllowedExitCodes\r\n  * BoutiquesFileNameMatcher\r\n  * BoutiquesForcedOutputBrowsePath\r\n  * BoutiquesInputCacheCleaner\r\n  * BoutiquesInputSubdirMaker\r\n  * BoutiquesOutputCacheCleaner\r\n  * BoutiquesOutputFilenameRenamer\r\n\r\n* Launching task arrays with a CbrainFileList now allows the user\r\n  to provide extra parameters specific to each row in the file list.\r\n  To do so, the file list should be an ExtendedCbrainFileList and\r\n  the last column should contain a serialized JSON structure that\r\n  can merge to the Boutiques parameters of the task.\r\n\r\n* A new tool BoutiquesDescriptorMaker is provided as part of the\r\n  base distribution. It allows a developer to test 'live' what a\r\n  Boutiques descriptor would look like in CBRAIN.",

        "description": "#### Version 6.2.0 Released 2022-01-28\r\n\r\n(After eleven months, the `git diff` output is over 12,000 lines long!)\r\n\r\nMajor features:\r\n\r\n* A new Boutiques integrator was implemented. This new framework\r\n  is modular and customizable, and much easier to maintain.\r\n  from the developer's perspective. Some technical documentation\r\n  is in this [presentation](https://prioux.github.io/new-boutiques-presentation/#/title).\r\n* The new Boutiques integrator comes with four new modules that sysadmins\r\n  can configure within each Boutiques descriptor:\r\n  * BoutiquesFileNameMatcher\r\n  * BoutiquesFileTypeVerifier\r\n  * BoutiquesOutputFileTypeSetter\r\n  * BoutiquesPostProcessingCleaner\r\n* Users can link their account to a Globus identity and\r\n  authenticate with Globus from that point on.\r\n* A new DataProvider types has been added: SingBindMountDataProvider.\r\n  It access files in squashfs or ext3 overlays using the singularity\r\n  bindmount feature.\r\n* The NeuroHub interface now shows the user's own private project.\r\n* A new 'stream' action has been added to the userfile model,\r\n  allowing seemless path-based access to file contents.\r\n* Sysadmins have access to a set of new rake tasks to extract old record\r\n  from the resource_usage table, and get them saved into YAML files.\r\n  Replacement monthly summary records can then be reinserted in the database\r\n  so that the usage tracking for all resources stay accurate.\r\n\r\nOther enhancements:\r\n\r\n* New NOC status and statistics pages: users over time, tools usage\r\n  over time, tasks CPU time over time.\r\n* The main login page has a public list of configured tools and datasets.\r\n* The data structure that maintains statistics about the portal\r\n  requests has been simplified.\r\n* S3 data providers can be onfigued with distinct regions and endpoints.\r\n* A new class of users, AutomatedUser, is available for automatic systems.\r\n* Admins can configure overlays for Singularity-launched tools\r\n  by provding the overlays as userfiles.\r\n* A new tool, SimpleFileExtractor, is provided with the distribution.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "## CBRAIN/NeuroHub Release Notes\r\n\r\n#### Version 6.1.0 Released 2021-02-26\r\n\r\nThis release contains several new features and bug fixes.\r\n\r\n* The Continuous Integration system has been switched from\r\n  Travis CI to GitHub actions. The control script for the\r\n  running the test suite is under .github/workflows/cbrain_ci.yaml\r\n* The remote script that starts a Bourreau has been switched\r\n  from a ruby script to a simpler bash script; the bash script\r\n  is used in the most common situation of launching a Bourreau,\r\n  and the old ruby script is still invoked in other rarer modes\r\n  of operation.\r\n* Browsing data providers now support 'local subpaths'. This\r\n  is enabled only on some select DataProvider subclasses.\r\n  This mechanism is meant for read-only data providers only,\r\n  and can only be accessed by administrators. Warning: registering\r\n  files that are subsets of other registered files has\r\n  un-predictable consequences.\r\n* A new specialized controller for LORIS hooks has been added.\r\n  This is used by automated operations from LORIS systems.\r\n* NeuroHub users can send direct messages to each other. This\r\n  feature is not accessible on the CBRAIN side yet, but users\r\n  can switch from one interface to the other.\r\n* NeuroHub users can destroy their old project.\r\n* Different internal mailer configurations allow two sets of\r\n  email messages to be set to users depending on whether they\r\n  interact with the CBRAIN side or the NeuroHub side (for\r\n  registration, password recovery etc).\r\n* CBRAIN administrators can now explicitely indicate that\r\n  a tool is known not to modify its input files, allowing\r\n  users to launch such tools on files on which they only\r\n  have read access. In the past, the interface would refuse\r\n  to launch the tools because it didn't know if that would\r\n  modify the files.\r\n* CBRAIN admins can configure tasks that are containerized\r\n  in Singularity to mount specific file overlays in the container\r\n  (for example, for fixed datasets).\r\n* CBRAIN admins can specify special Singularity run-time options\r\n  for tasks that are containerized with Singularity.\r\n* The task launching system will autodetect if a CBRAIN file\r\n  is located on a data provider that stores files in Singularity\r\n  overlays and mount the overlays automatically if the task\r\n  is also run with Singularity.\r\n* NeuroHub users can generate new API tokens just like on the\r\n  CBRAIN side.\r\n* Internal version tracking is performed by `git describe`\r\n  instead of the old ruby code that basically did the same thing.\r\n* The Boutiques integrator supports a new special custom\r\n  option allowing a task to save back its input automatically.",

        "description": "## CBRAIN/NeuroHub Release Notes\r\n\r\n#### Version 6.0.0 Released 2020-08-19\r\n\r\nMore than 8 months have passed since the previous release, 5.3.0!\r\n\r\nThis release introduces the new GUI interface called `NeuroHub`.\r\nThe original CBRAIN interface is still all there; NeuroHub\r\nis an additional set of pages providing a new look and feel, and\r\nnew capabilities. NeuroHub is still rather restricted in what\r\nit can do, but users can easily switch back and forth between\r\nthe two interfaces at the push of a button (located at the top\r\nand left on each interface).\r\n\r\nNew CBRAIN features: (some of these apply to NeuroHub too)\r\n\r\n* Projects can be tagged as 'un-assignable\", so that a member\r\n  of the project cannot assign userfiles or tasks or other resources\r\n  to it (except for the project's creator). This is mostly\r\n  useful for projects that represent fixed datasets that are\r\n  meant to be used but not extended further.\r\n* CBRAIN (and NeuroHub) now creates a single pair of SSH keys\r\n  (one private, one public) for each user that the system can\r\n  use to access external resources. The private key is never\r\n  made visible. Right now this is mostly useful for the new\r\n  UserkeyFlatDirSshDataProvider class in NeuroHub.\r\n* These keys (full pair) can be pushed to a Bourreau so that\r\n  the CBRAIN code running there can connect as the user. Users\r\n  have control over which bourreau to push their key pair to.\r\n* CBRAIN can generate a new API token and show it to the user\r\n  in their 'my account' page.\r\n* When a user accepts an invitation to join a project, the\r\n  person who made the invitation is notified.\r\n* When an admin reviews a signup request, they can tell\r\n  if the request was made using the CBRAIN or the NeuroHub\r\n  signup page.\r\n* Users can see how many active sessions they have (including\r\n  API sessions), and from what IP they connected.\r\n* Admins can set a user's default data provider when creating\r\n  their account.\r\n\r\nNeuroHub exclusive features:\r\n\r\n* If a user enters their ORCID ID in their profile, they\r\n  can log in using the ORCID authentication platform.\r\n* Projects are limited to \"Work\" projects; the other special\r\n  projects that CBRAIN supplies by default are hidden.\r\n* Projects can have special members designated as 'editors'.\r\n* Project editors have much the same powers as the project's creator.\r\n* A project's creator can assign a license to it; members will\r\n  have to agree to the license before they can access it.\r\n* Projects can be configured as 'public'. Things assigned to public\r\n  projects can be accessed by any user.\r\n* User can create their own Data Providers. This is limited right\r\n  now to DPs of type 'UserkeyFlatDirSshDataProvider'. The provider\r\n  side will be accessed using the personal SSH key of the user\r\n  who created the DP. Mostly useful for power users who want to\r\n  access remote filesystems.\r\n* Specialized API hooks for LORIS integrations. Right now, only\r\n  one such hook is implemented, `file_list_maker`.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n\r\n* Much code refactoring (e.g. FileInfo class, BrowseProviderFileCaching,\r\n  SshDataProviderBase...).\r\n* Selection boxes are shown with the chosen.jquery.js framework.\r\n* DP consistency checkers improved.\r\n",

        "description": "\r\n## Version 5.3.0 Released 2019-12-10\r\n\r\n#### New features:\r\n\r\n- From a Task's information page, a user can now access a \"Publish to Zenodo\"\r\n  page. The task's output and runtime information will be published to\r\n  Zenodo. Caveat: pushing data is done synchronously, which blocks the\r\n  browser (TODO, as pushing as a forked process messes up the libcurl library)\r\n- The Network Operation Center now provides weekly, monthly and yearly reports\r\n- Userfile resource usage tracking: whenever files are added, deleted or change size,\r\n  persistent records are made about the change\r\n- Task resource usage tracking: whenever tasks reach a final state, persistent records\r\n  are made. These include the status of the tasks, but also their accumulated CPU\r\n  and wall times\r\n- Administrators can configure 'epilogue' sections of the tool configs, to match\r\n  the existing prologue sections. This allow the admin to surround the running\r\n  script with e.g. `sg newgroup bash <<TOKEN` (in the prologue) and `TOKEN` (in\r\n  the epilogue), making sure the script runs with a particular effective GID.\r\n- The QC panels for userfiles have a new layout; also users can toggle between\r\n  one panel or two\r\n- The S3FlatDataProvider class now allows confiuring a S3 provider that starts\r\n  with a prefixed path (e.g. \"/a/b/c\", and all the files are under that)\r\n- Users now have an 'affiliation' field, with a controled set of values for it\r\n- Userfile custom viewers can return an informative error message informing the\r\n  framework why they aren't available for a particular file\r\n- New built-in viewers for singularity image files, json files, xml files\r\n- The Diagnostics tool has options for generating busy loops (system and/or user)\r\n\r\n#### Bug fixes:\r\n\r\n- Many many small ones.\r\n",
