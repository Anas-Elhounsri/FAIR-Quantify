User can adjust cut-off frequency (i.e., smoothing parameter): the lower the value, the smoother the motion is but it is important to note that the delay is also increased.\n\nThe GUI of the TrackerStabilizer module contains 4 elements:\n- Input Transform: This is the raw data, usually raw tracker data, represented by a vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode\n- Output Transform: This is the filtered transform represented also by a vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode. This node can be created directly from the list\n- Filter checkbox: This checkbox turn on/off the filtering\n- Smoothing slider: This slider control the smoothing parameter. In the left, smoother, with relatively important delay. In the right, faster (almost no delay), but noisier.\n"
