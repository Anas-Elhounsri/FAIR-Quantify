However, this requires a steep learning curve for the average researcher when learning the FAIR evaluation frameworks, disengaging some. \nThis project aims to use technology close this gap and make this process more accessible by bringing the FAIR evaluation to the researcher\u2019s profiles. \u201cThe FAIR extension\u201d is an open-source, user-friendly web browser extension allowing researchers to do FAIRness evaluations directly from scholarly aggregators such as PURE, Google Scholar, or ResearchGate without additional knowledge. The browser extension follows the FAIR metrics group specification, building on top of the community-accepted FAIR evaluators\u2019 APIs.\u00a0 \nWe aim to demonstrate that low-entry-level tools can bridge the gap between the researcher and the FAIR metrics. e.g. A data steward recommending FAIR sources or a researcher evaluating all FAIR metrics directly on scholarly profiles. \nThe development of this extension is made possible thanks to the [Netherlands eScience Center fellowship grant 2022-2023](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/fellowship-programme/)\n \n"

        "description": "## The FAIR Extension v1.1.0 Release Notes\r\n\r\nThis release brings several key updates and improvements to the FAIR extension, focusing on performance optimization, user experience enhancements, and bug fixes. Below is a summary of the main changes:\r\n\r\n### New Features and Improvements:\r\n- **Revamped CSS for Better Text Wrapping and Responsive Layout (#43):** The extension's styles have been updated for better text wrapping and responsive layout, providing a more consistent and pleasant user experience.\r\n- **Optimized and Debugged contentScript.js and background.js Scripts:** The scripts have been refined for enhanced performance and compatibility. This optimization makes the DOI detection more efficient.\r\n- **UI Feedback for API Calls:** A loading spinner has been added to the extension's interface. This spinner appears when the extension is evaluating a DOI, providing a visual cue to the users that the process is underway.\r\n- **Adjusted Font Size for Evaluation Results:** The font size of the FAIR evaluation results displayed in the extension popup has been reduced, making the results easier to read and more consistent with the overall style of the extension.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes:\r\n- **Fixed XMLHttpRequest in popup.js:** Removed the `require` function, which is not supported natively in browsers and wasn't needed for creating an XMLHttpRequest in the current context.\r\n- **Fixed Popup Console Error:** An issue that prevented the popup console from logging errors correctly has been resolved.\r\n- **popup.js Updated to Use DOMContentLoaded Event:** The `getDoi` function now waits for the full DOM to load before running, preventing potential timing issues.\r\n- **Addressed Crashing Websites Issue (#42):** Fixed a bug that caused some websites to crash when the extension was used.\r\n\r\n### Other Updates:\r\n- The extension now uses the year and version information from the `package.json` file.\r\n- The highlight color for detected DOIs has been adjusted for better visibility.\r\n\r\nFor more details about the changes and improvements in this release, check the [closed issues](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-Library/the-FAIR-extension/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) on our GitHub page. We thank our community for their contributions and feedback in making this release possible!",
