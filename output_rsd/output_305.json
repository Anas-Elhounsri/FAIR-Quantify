Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install R and R Studio:**\n   - Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).\n   - Download and install R Studio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).\n\n2. **Clone the Repository:**\n   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.\n   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git\n     ```\n\n3. **Create a Virtual Environment for R:**\n   - R projects often use `.Renviron` or `.Rprofile` for custom environment settings. Check the project's documentation for any specific configurations.\n   - In R, the equivalent to Python's requirements.txt is typically a file named renv.lock. This file contains information about the dependencies required in a R project,\n     including the versions of R and all installed packages.\n   - Set up a virtual environment using R's `renv` package. Navigate to the project directory and run:\n     ```R\n     install.packages(\"renv\")\n     library(renv)\n     renv::init()\n     ```\n\n When you have cloned the project and run renv::init(), renv will use the information in the 'renv.lock' file to recreate the exact environment we used in the project.\n   - Install project dependencies:\n     ```R\n     renv::install()\n     ```\n\n### Setup for Python Development\n\nTo contribute to our project in Python, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Python:**\n   - Download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Clone the Repository:**\n   - Fork the repository to your GitHub account.\n   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git\n     ```\n\n3. **Create a Virtual Environment for Python:**\n   - Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv venv\n     ```\n\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n     - On Windows: `venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n     - On Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`\n\n   - Install project dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n\n"

The goal of the HGEAR project is to chart shifts in the character and structure of political discourse during the era of the American Revolution. By comparing shifts\nin language usage (via [**ShiCo**](https://github.com/h-gear/ShiCo/) *(Shifting Concepts Through Time*) with changing formations in \ncorrespondence networks, we are able to measure how networks of communication within the [**Founders Online**](https://founders.archives.gov/) corpus and other resources such as the [**Letters of Delegates to Congress**](https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwdg.html) shaped the character, distribution, and spread of political ideas \nduring the Revolutionary era. This project and associated analyses offer powerful new methods\nfor addressing longstanding debates in the field of early American history. Also, by \nmeans of additional collected data, we show how the \nhere included scripts and analyses can be easily accomodated to include other letter\ncorrespondence sources as well.

For R , [*RStudio*](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is recommended, while for Python, we recommend [*anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/download).\n\n\n#### **Setting up the Virtual Environment for R**\nTo ensure a consistent and reproducible environment, this project uses the venv package in R. Follow these steps to set up the virtual environment and install the necessary packages:\n\n_Navigate to the Project Directory:_\n```\ncd revolution\n```\n\n_Run the Setup Script:_\n\nExecute the provided setup script (setup.bat) to automatically create and activate the virtual environment, and install the necessary packages:\n```\nsetup.bat\n```\nThis script will install the renv package, create and activate the virtual environment, and install the required R packages specified in renv.lock. \n\nBy running the provided setup script, Windows users can easily set up the required environment without worrying about manually installing packages. This approach streamlines the process and ensures that users have the correct dependencies in place.\n\nNote: Ensure that the script is executed with administrative privileges. If prompted, right-click on setup.bat and choose \"Run as administrator.\"\n\n_Run Your Code:_\n\nAfter the setup script completes, you are ready to run the code within the virtual environment. Execute your R scripts or run your Rmarkdown documents as usual.\n\n_Deactivate the Virtual Environment:_\n\nWhen you are done, deactivate the virtual environment:\n```\nvenv::deactivate()\n```\n\n#### **Python: Setting up a Virtual Environment**\nWe recommend installing hgear in a new virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.\n\nRun the following commands to create a virtual environment:\nFor _Windows_:\n```\npython -m venv ./.venv\n```\n\nFor _Unix or MacOS_:\n```\npython3 -m venv ./.venv\n```\n\n_Activate the Virtual Environment:_\nFor _Windows_:\n```\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n```\n\nFor _Unix or MacOS_:\n```\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n_Install Dependencies:_\nOnce the virtual environment is created and activated you can install the dependencies by running:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nAt this stage, you should be able to run the scripts.\n\n_Deactivate the Virtual Environment:_\nWhen you are done, deactivate the virtual environment:\n\n```\ndeactivate\n```"

For R , [*RStudio*](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is recommended, while for Python, we recommend [*anaconda*](https://www.anaconda.com/download). \n\n#### **Setting up the Virtual Environment for R**\nTo ensure a consistent and reproducible environment, this project uses the venv package in R. Follow these steps to set up the virtual environment and install the necessary packages: \n_Navigate to the Project Directory:_\n```\ncd revolution\n``` \n_Run the Setup Script:_ \nExecute the provided setup script (setup.bat) to automatically create and activate the virtual environment, and install the necessary packages:\n```\nsetup.bat\n```\nThis script will install the renv package, create and activate the virtual environment, and install the required R packages specified in renv.lock.  \nBy running the provided setup script, Windows users can easily set up the required environment without worrying about manually installing packages. This approach streamlines the process and ensures that users have the correct dependencies in place. \nNote: Ensure that the script is executed with administrative privileges. If prompted, right-click on setup.bat and choose \"Run as administrator.\" \nAfter the setup script completes, you are ready to run the code within the virtual environment. Execute your R scripts or run your Rmarkdown documents as usual. \n_Deactivate the Virtual Environment:_ \nWhen you are done, deactivate the virtual environment:\n```\nvenv::deactivate()\n``` \n#### **Python: Setting up a Virtual Environment**\nWe recommend installing hgear in a new virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. \nRun the following commands to create a virtual environment:\nFor _Windows_:\n```\npython -m venv ./.venv\n``` \n_Activate the Virtual Environment:_\nFor _Windows_:\n```\n.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n``` \nFor _Unix or MacOS_:\n```\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n``` \n_Install Dependencies:_\nOnce the virtual environment is created and activated you can install the dependencies by running:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nAt this stage, you should be able to run the scripts. \n_Deactivate the Virtual Environment:_\nWhen you are done, deactivate the virtual environment:\n```\ndeactivate\n```\n \n\n## Contributing\nIf you want to contribute to the development of hgear, have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).Please submit pull requests to us in case you want to participate.
