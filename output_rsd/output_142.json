It comes with eclipse, but you'll have to check if the path is set correctly if you want to run it from the command line. \nThe ant build file provides the following targets, which you can invoke it from the directory which contains build.xml with \n```\nant <target>\n``` \nwhere <target> is one of:\n```\ncompile:   just compile all classes\ndocs:      generate all apidocs\nexe:       generate executable jar file\nclean:     remove all generated files\ndist:      generate zip package and windows installer. \n           The zip package only includes files needed to *run* not compile.\nall:       clean, then compile, jar, dist and docs.\n``` \n********************************\n HOW TO RUN FROM THE TERMINAL \n******************************** \nIf you have managed to build the classes with ant or with eclipse, you \ncan use pathvisio.bat to start java from the command line.\n \n"
