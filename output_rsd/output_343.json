The repository includes a file `ClusterConf.ini.example` which can be appropriately modified and subsequently renamed. \nFurthermore, the user should supply a template file specifying the desired VM configuration. An example, `opennebula_goera.tpl`, is provided in the [`templates`](./templates) subfolder of the repository. Please bear in mind, that the base image for the OS disk must be made available for the user (with the credentials being used) before executing `marzipan`. \nWhen run as a script or by invoking the full deployment method `mazipan` will construct a VM template in OpenNebula, and deploy the requested number of VMs based on this template. `marzipan` will then monitor the deployment, only reporting successful execution when all VMs are in the `RUNNING` LCM_STATE. If this has failed to complete after 120 seconds marzipan will exit, notifying the user of failure. \n"
