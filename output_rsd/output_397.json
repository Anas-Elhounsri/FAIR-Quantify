We took this step because the different Java-Python bridges (pyjnius, jpype) were giving problems in multi-threaded environments. We now use Google's GRPC to communicate between Python and the Java implementation of Xenon. The Xenon-GRPC JAR file (including Xenon) is included in this distribution.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe new API is documented at [ReadTheDocs](http://pyxenon.readthedocs.io), it also contains many examples.\r\n\r\n### Versioning\r\nAt the same time Xenon underwent a redesign, culminating in the release of Xenon 2.0, now 2.2. Since Xenon-GRPC (including Xenon) is included in this distribution, we keep PyXenon version numbers in sync with Xenon. If changes happen to PyXenon without a new release of Xenon, a suffix is added.",

        "description": "## Changes:\n\n_Version 0.2.1_\nHotfix: moved Java libraries to the xenon package, for Python 3.5 support.\n\n_Version 0.2.0_\n- Because the pyjnius Java interface was very hard to install using pip, including for people just using the pyxenon library, we switched to JPype as a Java interface. The API has been kept the same, but part of this change may be exposed to users in terms of error messages and slight changes to calling functions with multiple signatures (e.g. which System.out.println function is called depends on what object type is passed, and you need a JPype function now to make that distinction).\n- we added some conversion functions to deal with Java streams and dict<->HashMap conversion\n- added a notice file\n- Using Xenon 1.1.0 release instead of the snapshot release.\n",
