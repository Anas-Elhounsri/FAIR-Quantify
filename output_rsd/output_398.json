There are a few guidelines that we\nneed contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on\ntop of things.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)\n* Fork the repository on GitHub\n\n## Making Changes\n\n* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.\n  * This is usually the master branch.\n  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that\n    branch.\n  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b\n    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the\n    `master` branch.\n* Make commits of logical units.\n* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.\n* Make sure your commit messages are informative.\n* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.\n* Run _all_ the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.\n\n## Submitting Changes\n\n* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n* Submit a pull request to the repository in the SCM-NV organization.\n* The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.\n\n# Additional Resources\n\n* [General GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/)\n* [GitHub pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/)\n"

        "value": "pyZacros (Python Library for Automating Zacros Simulation) is a collection of tools that aims to provide a powerful, flexible, and easily extendable Python interface to Zacros, a Kinetic Monte Carlo software package for simulating molecular phenomena on catalytic surfaces. pyZacros is designed as an extension of the Python library [PLAMS](https://github.com/SCM-NV/PLAMS). This will, therefore, inherit from PLAMS the robust way of managing input file preparation, job execution, file management, and output file processing. Above that, it also offers the possibility of postprocessing the results and building very advanced data workflows. \n1. First, the subject of the problem (description of the system and set of the desired simulation parameters) has to be written\n   to input text files (i.e. ``energetics_input.dat``, ``mechanism_input.dat``, ``lattice_input.dat``, ``simulation_input.dat``).\n2. The ``zacros.x`` program is executed and produces output text files (i.e. ``general_output.txt``, ``procstat_output.txt``,\n   ``history_output.txt``, ``specnum_output.txt``, ``lattice_output.txt``).\n3. Those output files may already contain the required information or at least contain enough information to get it after\n   a postprocessing step.\n4. This resultant information may be used to define parameters for further calculations. \npyZacros helps with the automation of all these steps described above directly from a python script and takes responsibility for tiresome and monotonous technical details allowing the user to focus on real science and your problem.\n \n"

In particular, there are classes to represent species, clusters, and elementary Reactions, among others, that are easy to set up and use. \nThe most important features of pyZacros: \n* Preparing, running, and examining results of Zacros jobs from within a single Python script\n* Convenient automatic file and folder management\n* Running jobs in parallel without a need to prepare a special parallel script\n* Integration with popular job schedulers (OGE, SLURM, TORQUE)\n* Prevention of multiple runs of the same job\n* Easy data transfer between separate runs\n* An efficient and simple way to restart the calculation in case of a crash or extend the simulation.\n* Almost full coverage of all input options and output data in Zacros.\n* Visualization and interactive building of the lattice of the system.\n* Default plot functions to visualize results like adlayer configurations, process statistics, and species numbers.\n* Reconstruction of the pyZacros objects from Zacros calculation, which were not managed by pyZacros.\n \n"

The CO* and O* individual\n   adsorbates (without lateral interactions) with 1.3 eV and 2.3 eV binding energies, respectively. (Lines 19-20)\n5. Three irreversible events: non-dissociative adsorption of CO, dissociative adsorption of O2, and fast reaction between\n   an O adatom and a CO adsorbate. (Lines 23-43)\n\nhttps://github.com/SCM-NV/pyZacros/blob/5150b0ceaf61ec3c39c1f1eb0e9a0d619e0b967f/examples/intro/intro0.py#L1-L68\n\nDon't worry if something in the above code is incomprehensible or confusing.\nEverything you need to know to understand how pyZacros works and how to write your own scripts is explained\nin the next chapters of this documentation.\n\nBy executing the above script, you are going to see a visual representation of the lattice (see script's line 16) that should\nbe similar to the image below:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"doc/images/ZGB-lattice.png\" style=\"width:40%\">\n</p>\n\nThen, you should see the plot of the number of molecules of each kind as a function of time during the simulation. We have split this information into two Figures for clarity, one for gas-phase species and the other one for surface species, as follows (see script's line 65-66):\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"doc/images/ZGB-mol_gas_nums.png\" style=\"width:40%\">\n    <img src=\"doc/images/ZGB-mol_surf_nums.png\" style=\"width:40%\">\n</p>\n\nDuring the execution, the following information is written to the standard output:\n\n```\n[02.11|12:07:12] PLAMS working folder: /home/user/plams_workdir\n[08.02|13:57:45] JOB plamsjob STARTED\n[08.02|13:57:45] JOB plamsjob RUNNING\n[08.02|13:57:45] JOB plamsjob FINISHED\n[08.02|13:57:45] JOB plamsjob SUCCESSFUL\nnCO2 =  [2790, 2790, 2790, 2792, 2792, 2793, 2793, 2795, 2797, 2797]\n[08.02|13:58:05] PLAMS run finished. Goodbye\n```\n\nIt indicates that pyZacros created a uniquely named working folder (``plams_workdir``) and then ran the Zacros calculation in a separate\nsubfolder of the working folder (``plamsjob``). All the files created by each Zacros run are saved in the corresponding subfolder for future reference. However, notice that you can access the results directly from the python script. To illustrate this, see line 64 of the script that produces line 6 in the standard output, which prints the number of CO2 molecules produced in the last ten-time steps of the simulation.\n"
