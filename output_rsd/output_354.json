Then execute the following commands in a command line environment (instructions for Linux):\n\n 1. `git clone https://github.com/newsgac/platform.git`\n 2. `cd platform`\n 3. `docker build . -t \"newsgac/newsgac\"`\n 4. `export $(egrep -v '^#' .env.default | xargs)`\n 5. `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml -c docker-compose.dev.yml newsgacdev`\n\nWhen these commands have successfully completed, the platform will be available as a web server on the address: [http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:5050](http://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:5050)\n\nSteps 1, 2 and 3 need to be executed only once for installing the system.\nBoth step 4 and step 5 are required each time when you start the system.\n\nOptional steps:\n\n * For adaption to local environment: edit file .env.default or create your own version\n * For Jupyter notebook support: `docker build . -f jupyter/Dockerfile -t \"newsgac/jupyterhub\"`\n * During production: `docker build ./nginx -t newsgac/nginx`\n * installation instructions for usage of a [kubernetes cluster](k8s/README.md) (CLARIAH)\n\nStopping the system:\n\n * `docker service rm newsgacdev_database newsgacdev_frog newsgacdev_frogworker newsgacdev_redis newsgacdev_web newsgacdev_worker`\n\nNote that it takes a few seconds to completely stop all parts of the system.\n\n"
