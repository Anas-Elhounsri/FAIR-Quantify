Its target audience\nis researchers who wish to systematically study content on social media platforms that resist conventional scraping or \nAPI-based data collection. \nYou can, for example, browse TikTok and later export a list of all posts you saw in the order you saw them in. Data can \nbe exported as a JSON file or exported to a [4CAT](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat) instance for \nanalysis and storage. Zeeschuimer is primarily intended as a companion to 4CAT, but you can also integrate its output\ninto your own analysis pipeline. \nCurrently, it supports the following platforms:\n* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com) (posts and comments)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) (posts only)\n* [X/Twitter](https://www.x.com)\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)\n* [9gag](https://9gag.com)\n* [Imgur](https://imgur.com)\n* [Douyin](https://douyin.com)\n* [Gab](https://gab.com) \nPlatform support requires regular maintenance to keep up with changes to the platforms. If something does not work, we\nwelcome issues and pull requests. See 'Limitations' below for some known limitations to data capture. \nThe extension does not interfere with your normal browsing and never uploads data automatically, only when you\nexplicitly ask it to do so. It uses the\n[WebRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest) browser API to\nlocally collect and parse the data search engines are sending to your browser as you use it.\n \n"

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

Basic instructions \nare as follows: \n\nInstall the browser extension in a Firefox browser. A button with the Zeeschuimer logo (a 'Z') will appear in the \nbrowser toolbar. Click it to open the Zeeschuimer interface. Enable capturing for the sites you want to capture from.\n\nNext, simply browse a supported platform's site. You will see the amount of items detected per platform increase as you \nbrowse. When you have the items you need, you can export the data as an [ndjson](https://ndjson.org) file, or upload it\nto a 4CAT instance where a 4CAT dataset will be created from the uploaded items. You can then run 4CAT's analytical \nprocessors on the data.\n\nTo upload to 4CAT, copy the URL of the website of the 4CAT instance to the \"4CAT instance\" field at the top of \nZeeschuimer's interface. You can then use the \"to 4CAT\" button to create a new 4CAT dataset from the captured data. \nAfter uploading, Zeeschuimer will show you a link and the ten most recently uploaded datasets are shown at the bottom of\nthe interface.\n\nDon't forget to reset the data as needed. For example, if you want to create a dataset for a given TikTok hashtag, first\nreset the TikTok data in Zeeschuimer, _then_ go to the hashtag's \"Explore\" page on TikTok, and then upload the dataset\nwhen you've scrolled down enough to be satisfied with the amount of items.\n\nIf you find yourself scrolling a lot to collect data, consider using another browser extension to do it for you, for \nexample [FoxScroller](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxscroller/).\n"
