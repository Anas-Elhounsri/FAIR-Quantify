Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. [you have a question](#questions);\n2. [you think you may have found a bug](#bugs) (including unexpected behavior);\n3. [you want to make some kind of change to the code base](#changes-or-additions) (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation);\n4. [you want to make a new release of the code base](#new-release).\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://groups.google.com/g/RpackageGGIR) to see if someone already experienced the same issue;\n2. if your search did not yield any relevant results, start a new conversation.\n\n## Bugs\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, and choose the Bug report type. This includes a checklist to make sure you provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem.\n\n## Changes or additions\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue. Choose the Feature request type, which includes a checklist of things to consider to get the discussion going;\n2. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n3. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n4. make sure the existing tests still work by running the test suite from RStudio;\n5. add your own tests (if necessary);\n6. update or expand the documentation, see [package documentation guidelines](#package-documentation);\n7. make sure the release notes in `inst/NEWS.Rd` are updated;\n8. add your name to the contributors lists in the `DESCRIPTION` file;\n9. push your feature branch to (your fork of) the GGIR repository on GitHub;\n10. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). The pull request template includes a checklist with the above items.\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n\n### Coding style\n\nWe loosely follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), but do not enforce every rule strictly.\nFor instance, we prefer `=` instead of `<-` as the default assignment operator.\nWhen in doubt about what style to use, don't hesitate to get in touch.\n\nSome general guidelines that we try to adhere to:\n\n- Use standard R as much as possible, keep dependencies to a minimum.\n- Keep loops to a minimum.\n- Don't make lines too long.\n\nIf you are a first time contributor, don't worry about coding style too much.\nWe will help you get things in shape.\n\n### Package documentation\n\nWe currently have three sources for documenting the package:\n\n- The reference manual, including package basic information and the functions documentation files.\n- The package vignettes.\n- The github.io website (built with the `pkgdown` package).\n\n#### Reference manual\n\nThe reference manual gets the information from the .Rd documents within the man\nfolder in the package repository. Therefore, updating the information in those\nfiles will automatically update the reference manual. Note that most of the GGIR\nfunctions are not intended for direct interaction with the user, as such, the\ndocumentation of most arguments is centralized in the details section of man/GGIR.Rd. \nIf you for example want to add an extra parameter to `params_247` then this should\nbe documented there. Further, you should not forget to include the new argument in\nfunctions \\link{load_params} and \\link{check_params}.\n\n#### Package vignettes\n\nThe folder vignettes in the GGIR repository contains the .Rmd files. The .Rmd files\nthat do not start with the word 'chapter' are used for the traditional package vignettes\nas hosted by CRAN. Use these files to edit an existing vignette, or use the structure\nof any of the vignettes to build up a new one. All .Rmd files which name \nstarts with the word 'chapter' are ignored. These chapter-vignettes are used only for\nthe github.io website (see [next section](#github.io-website)).\n\n**To create a new vignette for CRAN**\n\nTo create a new package vignette for CRAN, please use `usethis::use_vignette()` and\nmake sure the name of the vignette file does not start by \"chapter\". For example,\nif you want to create a new vignette on sleep for CRAN, you may do the following:\n\n```\nusethis::use_vignette(name = \"sleep\", \n                      title = \"How to analyse your sleep data in GGIR\")\n```\nThis would create a new \"sleep.Rmd\" file within the vignettes folder in the GGIR\nrepository. Then you can edit this file to build up the vignette.\n\n**To remove a vignette from CRAN**\n\nThere are two ways to remove a vignette from CRAN:\n\n1. Removing the Rmd file corresponding to the vignette in the vignettes folder,\nnote that the file and the information will be lost.\n2. Adding the path to the vignette in the .Rbuildignore file available in the\nGGIR repository. For example, to remove the GGIRParameters vignette from CRAN, you\ncan add:\n\n```\n^vignettes/GGIRParameters.Rmd\n\n```\n\n#### github.io website\n\nFor updating or adding information to the github.io website, we need to use\n[the pkgdown configuration file](_pkgdown.yml) that can be found in the repositories \nroot directory, as well as with the chapter vignettes discussed above.\n\n**To edit information in an existing chapter**\n\n1. Open the vignette corresponding to the chapter you wish to edit (see the _pkgdown.yml) \nfile for the chapter and its vignette path (href).\n2. Make your changes in the vignette.\n3. Run the `pkgdown::build_site()` function.\n\n**To add a new chapter**\n\n1. Create a Rmd file for the vignette via `usethis::use_vignette()` and make sure the \nname of the vignette starts by \"chapter\", for example: \n\n```\nusethis::use_vignette(name = \"chapterSleep\", \n                      title = \"10. How to analyse your sleep data in GGIR\")\n```\n\n2. Open the [_pkgdown.yml](_pkgdown.yml) file and fill up the name and reference of the\nnew chapter under menu. Make sure to follow the coding and structure of the rest of chapters.\n3. Run the `pkgdown::build_site()` function.\n\n**To remove a chapter**\n\n1. Remove the lines corresponding to the chapter in the [_pkgdown.yml](_pkgdown.yml) file\nin line 42 onwards.\n2. Optionally you may remove the Rmd file corresponding to the chapter, but only by doing the\nstep 1, the chapter will not appear in the github.io website.\n3. Run the `pkgdown::build_site()` function.\n\n**To edit the name of a chapter**\n\nChapter names are defined twice, in the [_pkgdown.yml](_pkgdown.yml) file and in the\nvignette file itself. You need to make sure both titles match as the first will be \nused in the drop-down list in the github.io website and the other in the specific\npage for the chapter. \n\n#### Adding the changes to the master branch\n\nThe last step would be committing and pushing your changes to github and making a\npull request as with any other contribution to the package. Note that, running the \n`pkgdown::build_site()` function will edit the files within the docs folder, and \nprobably add some new files. This only applies when editing information from the \ngithub.io website. It is important that these changes to the files in the\ndocs folder are also part of the pull requests, as otherwise the website would not \nbe updated.\n\n## New release\n\nGGIR follows the [release cycle process described in this document](RELEASE_CYCLE.md)."

Note that these packages are not installed by default,\nso please follow the instructions if:\n\n-   You want to derive Neishabouricounts (with\n    `do.neishabouricounts = TRUE`), install the actilifecounts package\n    with `install.packages(\"actilifecounts\")`\n-   You want to process Sensewear xlsx files (with\n    `dataFormat = \"sensewear\"`), install the readxl package\n    with `install.packages(\"readxl\")`\n\n## Installing older versions of a package\n\nWhen aiming to reproduce historical analysis it is critical to install the correct package version.\nBelow we will explain how to do this for GGIR release 2.4-0 but this should work for any release. Note that GGIR is archived on both CRAN (major releases only) and GitHub (all releases).\n\n**From CRAN archive:**\n\n```\nrequire(remotes)\ninstall_version(\"GGIR\", version = \"2.4-0\", repos = \"http://cran.us.r-project.org\")\n```\n\nTo see which releases are available on CRAN check out: https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/GGIR/.\n\n**From GitHub:**\n\n```\nrequire(remotes)\ninstall_github(\"wadpac/GGIR\", ref = \"2.4-0\")\n```\nTo see which releases are available on CRAN check out: https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/releases.\n"

        "description": "- Part 1 and 2: Change default value for nonwear_approach to \"2023\" which labels the entire window as nonwear if conditions are met. This instead of only the middle 15 minutes as is the case for \"2013\" setting. Further, setting \"2023\" now uses a 5 Hertz version of the signals for non-wear detection, for clipping detection the code uses the original signal.\r\n\r\n- Part 2: Move cosinor analysis code to its own function in order to ease re-using it in both part 2 and part 6.\r\n\r\n- Part2: Expand cosinor analysis with R2\r\n\r\n- Part 2: Arguments hrs.del.start and hrs.del.end when combined with strategy = 3 and strategy = 5 now count\r\nrelative to start and end of the most active time window as identified.  #905\r\n\r\n- Part 5: Change default for segmentDAYSPTcrit.part5 from c(0,0) to c(0, 0.9) and now prohibiting the use of c(0, 0) as it gives biased estimates. We knew this, but some users started using the default without attempting to understand it, by which it seems necessary to force a sensible default. #940\r\n\r\n- Part 5: Added optioned \"OO\" to argument timewindow, which defines windows from sleep Onset to sleep Onset #931",
