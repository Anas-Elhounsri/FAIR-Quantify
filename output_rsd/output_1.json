        "value": "# Contributing to HADDOCK3\n\nWelcome, we made many efforts to facilitate your contribution to this\nfantastic project. There are several ways to contribute:\n\n* you can improve tutorials and/or documentation\n* improve the code itself (maybe you even found some bug :bug:?)\n* improve error messages so they become clearer\n* add a new simulation module altogether\n* write more unittests (we dare you to do that :godmode:)\n\nBefore attempting any development, please install HADDOCK3 following the\ninstructions in the [INSTALL](docs/INSTALL.md) file. Afterwards, follow the\ninstructions in this file.\n\n## 1. Contributing new code\n\nHADDOCK3 has two main testing workflows. Here, within the repository, we\ntest the HADDOCK3's Python shell, code style, and package building.  Our\nContinuous Integration (CI) pipeline is based on\n[tox][tox] and GitHub Actions. We will\nexplain you how to use them.\n\nTo contribute to the HADDOCK3's Python shell, follow these steps:\n\n1.  [Fork][fork] the HADDOCK3 repository\n2.  Create a new branch in your fork (`git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`)\n3.  Develop your code and tests:\n\n    1.  HADDOCK3 source is in `src/haddock`. Always implement code in\n    the lowest Python version supported (this case is 3.9).\n    2.  Tests sit in the `tests/` folder. Use\n    [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) for testing.\n    3. See more details on how to contribute with code and tests in the\n    subheadings below.\n\n4.  While you are developing (or when you think you have finished), you can\n    (should) use our `tox` environments to test your code. Use the\n    following commands from the main repository folder:\n\n    1.  `tox -e test` runs tests in current python version. If you tox\n    to report test names and status for every single test (high verbosity) use\n    `tox -e test -- -vv`.\n    2.  `tox -e lint` shows you errors in the code style.\n    3.  `tox -e build` simulates building the HADDOCK3 package.\n    4.  Run the above altogether with the simple `tox` command\n    5.  If you want to submit high-quality code, you may wish to run\n    `tox -e radon` to assess your code cyclomatic complexity.\n\n5.  You can work on these `tox` tests until they all pass green before\nsubmitting your PR.\n\n6. Check if your contribution fulfills the requeriments proposed in the\nPR template, these are based on the experience of some developers to ensure the long-term\nsurvival of the codebase. Suggestions are always welcomed.\n\n7.  We also have an `examples` folder with test cases that you can run\n(should) to ensure the integrity of the python shell as a whole:\n    1.  Navigate to any of the examples folder and run the `-test.cfg`\n    file (see [USAGE](USAGE.md)).\n    2. `*-test.cfg` runs are meant for testing purposes only. The\n    `examples/` folder also contain `*-full.cfg` files for production runs.\n    You don't need to run these for testin.\n    2.  If you have a powerful computer and want to run all tests in a\n    row, navigate to the `examples` folder and run `python run_tests.py\n    -b`. The `-b` flag ensures the run will stop asap an error is found.\n    3. if your computer is not powerful enough, you can ask us to run\n    those tests once you submitted the pull request.\n    4. For example, the `docking-protein-protein-test.cfg` run in less\n    than 3 minutes on a `Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz` laptop\n    using 7 cores. All `-test.cfg` together take about 45 minutes.\n\n8.  Add a list of your new additions to the `CHANGELOG.md` file by\nadding a new sub-header as described bellow. This is mandatory for `tox\n-e build` to pass. Note this applies only after we have released the\nstable `3.0.0` version.\n\n```markdown\n# Changelog\n\n## new_version\n\n* your change one\n* your change two\n\n(... the rest of the file ...)\n```\n\n8.  If you have difficulties with `tox`, let us know. These `tox` tests\nare the same that run on the GitHub Actions once you send the PR. So,\nsending the PR is another way to ensure all tests pass.\n\n9.  Submit your PR if you haven't done so yet :wink:\n\n    1.  GitHub allows submitting \"Draft PRs\". You can use this\n    option to let us know you are working on some new good stuff so we\n    can help you from the beginning.\n\n### 1.1 Contributing with code (additional details)\n\n**You should also know that...** HADDOCK3 folders, files, and code\nfollow a well defined structure with very specific patterns. Inside each\nsource folder you will (likely) find a `README` file describing the\nstructure of the folder and presenting guidelines on how to better\ncontribute to that folder and respective files. Summarizing here:\n\n* New command-line clients go in the `clis/` folder. See how the current\n  clients here created and use that as a template. Remember to update also the\n  `setup.py` file.\n* Add any new functions that you foresee are general and\n  could serve different places in the code to the `libs/` folder. Find a\n  `lib*.py` files that would serve your purpuses, otherwise create a new\n  one.\n* Any plug-in like functionality, for example *\"check if input is\n  correct\"*, should go into its own python module inside the `gear/`\n  folder. Any variables, functions, and classes related only to that\n  implementation should go all inside the same module (Python file).\n* Any general hard definitions, or physical constants, should go in the\n  `core/` folder.\n* If you want to implement a new HADDOCK3 module, navigate to the\n  `modules/` folder and follow the instructions in the `README` file\n  there. You will see that all folders and files follow a pattern.\n* Talk with us before developing any CNS related part.\n\n### 1.2 Contributing with tests (additional details)\n\nInside the `tests/` folder you will find several `test_*.py` files.\nNormally, each file has the tests for each `*.py` file in the source. If\nyou create new `*.py` files you should create a new test file of the\nsame name, `test_new_file_name.py`. Aim at 100% test coverage for the\ncode you have created. Write tests according to [pytest][pytest]. You\ncan see examples in our `test_*.py` files. You can run the tests using\nthe `tox -e test` commands explained above. Or, if you want to run the\ntests for a singly file use `tox -e test -- tests/test_myfile.py`.\n\n### 1.3 Dependencies\n\nHADDOCK3 is highly interconnected with other projects. Many of them use\nHADDOCK3 core functionalities. Therefore, we aim to keep HADDOCK3 with\nthe lowest dependency footprint possible. Avoid adding dependencies when\ndeveloping new functionalities. How?\n\n1. Use the Python standard library as much as possible.\n1. Numpy is always allowed.\n1. If you need to implement heavy calculations, it is best you use\n[Numba][numba] instead of C libraries. Talk with us before.\n1. You need a small function from a large library. Try to reimplement it\nyourself with the Python standard library.\n    1. If you can't, talk first with\nus by opening an issue.\n1. You need a big and complex function or maybe a whole python file from\nanother project. If licenses are compatible, copy their code to the\nHADDOCK3 repository writing all necessary headers to grant authorship\nand comply with license requirements.\n    1. If licenses aren't compatible, talk is us. We may have an\n    alternative.\n1. Your new module largely depends on a library and reimplementing or\ncopying is not an option. Then, consider if we can use that dependency\nas a **runtime dependency** (like `gdock` or `lightdock`) instead of an\ninstallation dependency.\n1. Nothing of the above is possible. You **really** need an *install\ndependency*. Talk with us before.\n\n### 1.4 Code style\n\nHADDOCK3 follows nice code style rules. These are *almost* hard rules,\nbut there is some room for exceptions - common sense prevails. When\ndeveloping code, run `tox -e lint` to inspect if your code follows our\nconventions. We use [flake8][flake] with the [following rules][fr] and\ndocstrings follow [numpydoc][numpydoc] style. You can hold on our code\nfor style. Nevertheless, here's a dummy code snippet for your reference.\nLine have a soft max of 80 chars.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"Module's docstring.\"\"\"\n# any comments. You can add here licensing stuff\n# first import standard library\nimport os\nfrom path import Pathlib\n\n# import third library\nimport numpy as np\n\n# import from haddock3\nfrom haddock import log\n# multiline import\nfrom haddock.libs.libio import (\n    lib1,\n    lib2,\n    lib3,\n    lib4,\n    )\n\n\n# all this are possible\nGLOBAL_VARIBLE = None\n_hidden_global_variable = None\n\navoid_lower_case_globals = None\n\n\ndef my_nice_func(arg1, arg2, arg3):\n    \"\"\"Docstring here.\"\"\"\n    # do stuf\n\n# if the function has many arguments, separate them by new lines.\n# mind the identations\ndef my_nice_func_with_big_name(\n        var1,\n        var2,\n        var3,\n        named_var1=\"something\",\n        named_var2=\"else\",\n        **kwargs,\n        ):\n    \"\"\"Docstring here.\"\"\"\n    # do stuff\n    return\n\n\nmultiline_list = [\n    var1,\n    var2,\n    var3,\n    var4,\n    ]\n\nmultiline_dict = {\n    \"key1\": 1,\n    \"key2\": 2,\n    \"key3\": 3,\n    \"key4\": 4,\n    \"key5\": 5,\n    }\n\n# separate comprehensions by sections if line don't fit 80 chars\n# same for dictionaries\ncool_list_comprehension = [\n    dome_some_long_stuff(i)\n    for i in some_iterable\n    if validate(i)\n    ]\n\ndouble_quotes_allowed = \"string\"\nsingle_quotes_allowed = 'string'\n# don't try to homogenize quotes all around the code, respect the\n# original input.\n\n# define first use later\ngenerator_with_a_large_name = zip(\n    iter1,\n    iter2,\n    iter3,\n    iter4,\n    iter5,\n    )\n\nfor a, b, c, d, e in generator_with_a_large_name:\n    # do stuff\n\n# use noqa: E501 for slightly long lines, in case splitting into\n# multiple lines reduces readability\nthis_is_a_long_line = that_makes_no_much_sense(to_separate, in_multiple_lines, abcd)  # noqa: E501\n```\n\n### 1.5 Code structure\n\nWrite code in the form of small functions, because small functions are\neasier to test. Combine small functions to compose larger functions. If\nyou need to use a global variable in a function, pass it as a default\nvalue of a parameter. Avoid using complex classes, or avoid using\nclasses at all, unless you need to maintain a state or you really know\nwhat you are doing. Flat is better than nested (though it's harder to\nwrite, but it's easier to maintain and read). Use long variable names if\nneeded. Write comments that explain why you do stuff, and not how you do\nstuff. Use the `TODO:` flag in your comments to note something for the\nfuture. If needed, raise an issue.\n\n### 1.6 Creating a new module\n\nTo develop a new HADDOCK3 module follow our guidelines and templates\nunder `src/haddock/modules/_template_cat/_template_mod/`.\n\n## 2. Contributing with documentation\n\nYou may contribute to HADDOCK3 documentation by improving parts where\ndocumentation is lacking or writing the documentation for the new code\nyou propose. HADDOCK3 documentation is hosted online at\nhttps://bonvinlab.org/haddock3.\n\nHADDOCK3 documentation is rendered with\n[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) combining markdown\nfiles, restructured text files, and extracting the docstrings in the\nsource code.\n\nThe `docs/` folder contains all the files used by Sphinx to compile the\ndocumentation to HTML files. To incorporate new documentation pages or\nupdate the existing ones, navigate around the `docs/` folder to learn\nhow we have structured it and add/edit the files you find relevant. You\nwill see that the structure of folders and files follows the design of\nthe documentation website.\n\nYou can render the documentation locally to inspect the end result\nbefore creating a pull request. To compile the documentation locally:\nactivate the `haddock3` python environment inside the haddock3 github\nfolder, run `tox -e docs` and then use your favourite browser to open the\n`haddock3-docs/index.html` file. We invite you to read through Sphinx-doc\nwebpage if you want to exploit any advanced feature of Sphinx, but we\nalready provide examples for virtually any use you may need.\n\nIf you need to install any additional library, talk to us first. The\ndocumentation requirements are in the `devtools` folder.\n\nFinally, if you find the need to generate new pages during the HTML\ncompilation part, you may follow the `devtools/build_defaults_rst.py` as\nan example. See also the `docs/conf.py` file `setup(app)` line.\n\n**Troubleshooting:**\n\n1. If you add any new dependency (import statement) in the code, you\n  need to add that library name to the `mock` list in the `docs/conf.py`\n  file.\n\n\n[tox]: https://tox.wiki/en/latest/index.html \"tox\"\n[fork]: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo\n[pytest]: https://docs.pytest.org/ \"pytest\"\n[flake]: https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/ \"flake8\"\n[fr]: https://github.com/haddocking/haddock3/blob/b44304f0a1509d44d9689d7e2e4124f0ae3af0a1/tox.ini#L116-L130\n[numpydoc]: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html\n[numba]: https://numba.pydata.org/ \"Numba\"\n"

Below, you will find a list of all third-party\npackages HADDOCK3 can use and guidelines for their proper installation.\n\n### `lightdock` (outdated)\n\nTo install [lightdock](https://github.com/lightdock/lightdock) follow\nthe instructions on the project's website. Remember to install it under\nthe same Python environment you created for HADDOCK3. If you have any\ndoubts, please let us know.\n\n### `gdock` (outdated)\n\n1. Clone the latest version:\n\n```\ncd some-folder\ngit clone https://github.com/rvhonorato/gdock.git\n```\n\n2. Install Python3+ dependencies\n\n```\npip install deap scipy mgzip biopython\n```\n\n3. Set `GDOCK_PATH`\n\n```\nexport GDOCK_PATH=some-folder\n```\n\n**Important**: These are not the full `gdock` installation\ninstructions as only the model generation is used here. Please check the\n[repository page](https://github.com/rvhonorato/gdock) for more\ninformation.\n"
