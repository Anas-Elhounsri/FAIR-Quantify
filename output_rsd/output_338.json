        "description": "The initial LXCat v3 beta release. Most of the required functionality is implemented. This includes data selection and inspection for users, and data uploading and management for contributors. Currently only cross section data is supported. Other data types such as potentials and swarm parameters will be implemented in a succeeding version. The changelog only includes changes that were made after moving to GitHub. The subsequent changelogs will be more descriptive.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Migrate from GitLab CI to GitHub actions by @daanboer in https://github.com/LXCat-project/LXCat/pull/127\r\n* Update docs by @daanboer in https://github.com/LXCat-project/LXCat/pull/128\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/LXCat-project/LXCat/commits/v3.0.0.beta.0",
