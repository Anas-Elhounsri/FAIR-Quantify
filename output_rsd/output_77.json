        "description": "There are significant improvements to TraP throughout this release. These improvements lead to some speed improvements and solves a source association issue seen in R5.0. I recommend setting up a new project and new jobs to ensure that you have the correct pipeline.cfb and job_params.cfg files.\r\n\r\n### Major changes\r\n- Upgraded to support Python 3 only. I recommend using a Conda environment running Python 3.11 to install this release.\r\n- Upgraded database to postgresql 14. This means you also need to upgrade the database running on your system. N.B. I have not tried this yet so **be careful** - I do not know what happens to your old databases at this time. I will be testing this priori to this becoming an official release.\r\n- Significant improvements and parallelisation of PySE.\r\n\r\nThe documentation will be updated prior to this becoming an official release.\r\n\r\nIf you test this release candidate, please let me know about your experiences and if there are any issues with the new code.",

        "description": "# 4.0\n\nNo changes since 4.0rc1.\n\n## Changes since 3.1.1\n\n### frequency band logic change\n\nthe band determination logic has changed. Before all bands where split\ninto 1 MHz intervals and associated as such. With this release  images\nare put in the same band if their bandwidths overlap.\n\nWe added an option to limit the bandwidth used for band association\n([#492](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/issues/492)). Limiting the bandwidth for an image is done by\nsetting `bandwidth_max` in _job_params.cfg_ under the\n`persistence section`. E.g.:\n\n```\n[persistence]\nbandwidth_max = 0.0\n```\n\nSetting the value to 0.0 will use the bandwidth defined in the image\nheaders, a non 0.0 value will override this value.\n\n### added streaming telescope support\n\nThe internals of TraP have been rewritten to support streaming AARTFAAC\ndata ([#483](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/pull/483)). There is now a new section in the job_params.cfg file\nwith a `mode` setting. Setting this to `batch` will keep the old TraP\nbehavior, but setting `mode` to `stream`will enable switch TraP\nto streaming mode. TraP will connect to a network port and process\nimages from the network until terminated.\n\nThe hosts and ports where to connect to is controlled with the hosts\nand ports settings:\n\n```\n[pipeline]\nmode = 'stream'\nhosts = 'struis.science.uva.nl,struis.science.uva.nl'\nports = '6666,6667'\n```\n\nThe batch mode should mostly be unaffected, only the order of actions\nhas changed. TraP will process the full dataset now in chunks grouped by\ntimestamp. The storing of images, quality checks and meta data\nextraction is now run together with the source extraction and association\ncycle, where before this was all done at the start of a TraP run.\nThis makes it more similar to how we process streaming data and enabled\nother optimisations in the future (like keeping images in memory per\ntimestamp group).\n\n### Removal of MongoDB image store\n\nIf you enable the `copy_images` setting in your pipeline.cfg file\nthe images are now stored in the sql database ([#534](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/pull/534)). This makes it\nmuch easier to manage the files, for example delete them. Also the\nimages load faster in banana. This makes setting up and configuring\nMongoDB obsolete. \n\n### Add command line option to delete dataset\n\nIt is now possible to delete a dataset and its associated images ([#533](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/pull/533))::\n\n```\n$ trap-manage.py deldataset 5 -y\n\ndataset 5 has been deleted!\n```\n\n### Make TraP more resilient against faulty data\n\nTraP often crashed on faulty image data. On popular request TraP will\nnow try to continue, giving a warning. [#522](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/issues/522)\n\n### Various other changes and bugfixes\n- Fix Numpy 1.9+ compatibility [#509](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/issues/509)\n- TraP sourcefinder error on updated AARTFAAC images [#505](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/issues/505)\n- forced fits is not parallelised [#526](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/issues/526)\n- restructure logging, make less verbose.

E.g.:\n\n```\n[logging]\ncolorlog = True\n```\n\nThis is accompanied by some adjustments to the logging, we now output both\nINFO and DEBUG level logfiles (under the `<jobdir>/logs/<run_datestamp>` folders).\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Catch some forced fitting bugs that could possibly have been encountered\n  due to oversize 'skyregion' settings, or simply when reducing mosaic images\n  with 'NaN' pixel regions. ([#496](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/pull/496))\n\n### Documentation\n- Add ['features overview'](http://tkp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction.html#key-features)\n  section to docs.\n- Document use (and units) of 'monitoring-coords' option to _trap-manage.py_.\n  ([#485](https://github.com/transientskp/tkp/issues/485))\n",
