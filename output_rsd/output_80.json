(**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community _before you start working_. \nThis announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest \nmaster commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in \nchanges, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions \n[here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and \n[here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``nosetests``;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to the master branch in your fork.\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how \nto generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request, just go \nahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull \nrequest.\n\n### Adding a new component to ece2cmor3\nThis are some initial guidelines for people that want to add support for output of other EC-Earth components, such as \nTM5, LPJ-GUESS or PISM. In the ece2cmor3/ece2cmor3 directory, type\n```bash\n grep -iHn NEWCOMPONENT *.py\n```\nThis gives an idea where some action is needed, as we labeled all points by ``NEWCOMPONENT``. You will need to add an\nitem to the dictionary ``models`` in the ``components.py``, e.g.\n```python\nmodels = {\"ifs\": {realms: [\"atmos\", \"atmosChem\", \"land\", \"landIce\"],\n                  table_file: os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"resources\", \"ifspar.json\"),\n                  script_flags: (\"atm\", 'a')},\n          \"nemo\": {realms: [\"ocean\", \"ocnBgchem\", \"seaIce\"],\n                   table_file: os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"resources\", \"nemopar.json\"),\n                   script_flags: (\"oce\", 'o')},\n          \"your_model\" : {realms: [\"your_cmip_realm\"],\n                   table_file: os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"resources\", \"your_table_file.json\")}\n          }\n```\nThis registers ``your_model`` as a new component during the loading of the tasks, and it will give preference to your \nmodel if you claim to process data for ``your_cmip_realm`` for such variables. It will look for these variables in the \njson-file ``your_table_file.json``, so you will have to create that, please look at e.g. ``nemopar.json`` for the\nschema that we expect; you will need to specify a ``source`` attribute for each variable, e.g. \n```json\n...\n{\n  \"source\" : \"your_var_name\",\n  \"target\" : \"co2\"\n},\n...\n```\nThis entry will create a task with a ``cmor_source`` containing ``your_var_name`` as variable name and ``co2`` as a \ntarget. Upon execution ``ece2cmorlib`` contains a list of tasks, some of which belong to your model component. \nFrom that point, you have to implement the processing of the tasks yourself, although you may want to get inspiration \nfrom e.g. ``nemo2cmor.py``. Moreover you can use some utilities in the code such as the ``cdo`` python wrapper. \n"

The main api module ece2cmorlib calls initialization and processing functions in these ocean and atmosphere specific codes. The full workload is divided into tasks, which consist of a source (an IFS grib code or NEMO parameter id) and a target (a cmor3 CMIP6 table entry). The tasks are constructed by the Fortran namelist legacy loader (namloader.py) or by the new json-loader (default). The working is similar to the previous ece2cmor tool: the loader reads parameter tables and creates tasks as it receives a dictionary of desired targets from the caller script. \nAt execution, the nemo2cmor module searches for the sources in the NEMO output files and streams the data to cmor to rewrite it according to CMIP6 conventions. For the IFS component, the module first performs the necessary post-processing steps, creating a list of intermediate netcdf files that contain time-averaged selections of the data. Special treatment such as unit conversions and post-processing formulas are attached to the tasks as attributes, as well as the file path in which the source data resides.\n \n"

        "description": "**General overview release 1.2.0**\r\n\r\nThis `ece2cmor3` `release 1.2.0` is the first release which is fully compatible with an EC-Earth3 release: the tagged [EC-Earth3.3.1.1](https://svn.ec-earth.org/ecearth3/tags/3.3.1.1) version which includies the `control-output-files` produced with `genecec` with this `ece2cmor3` `release 1.2.0`.\r\n\r\nThis  release includes for instance a fix for the NEMO reference time and calendar name.\r\n\r\nWith this `ece2cmor3 / genecec`  `release 1.2.0` running EC-Earth3 and cmorise the following experiments, resulted in:\r\n\r\n| experiment  | Number of nemo variables| Number of ifs variables|\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |\r\n| piControl | 82 - 2*   ** | 137  |\r\n| historical  | 115  | 155  |\r\n| scenario ssp5 8.5  | 86  | 146  |\r\n\r\n\\*    The minus 2 is because the tested piControl run missed two variables which are currently included.\r\n\\*\\* The `test-all-nemo-mip-variables` test produces 177 cmorised NEMO variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Overview of remaining DECK + historical + ScenarioMIP related issues with release v1.2.0:**\r\n\r\n**1. ua100m & va100m #496**\r\nFor backward compatibility this issue won't be addressed in `ece2cmor3 v1.2.0`. However thereafter we will use grib codes `246.228` & `247.228` for `ua100m` & `va100m` as in the `ua-va-100m` branch is implemented already, running `genecec` with that will change the control output files.\r\n\r\n**2. Ofx/sftof varies with time #483**\r\nBecause this is a time invariant variable which can be produced afterwards, we did not like to delay the `EC-Earth3.3.1.1 -- ece2cmor3 v1.2.0` compatible release by this issue. We should have taken off the `Ofx sftof` variable from the json data request file, however we forgot, so it will be cmorised but based on the wrong fields. Hopefully a `1.2.x` version will include a fix.\r\n\r\n**3. Missing time bounds #472**\r\nAppeared to be not a real issue.\r\n\r\n**4. QA-DKRZ only invalid values #471**\r\nThese invalid-field variables have been removed from the json data request files, so won't show up among your cmorised output. So we followed approach 2 from [here](https://github.com/EC-Earth/ece2cmor3/issues/498#issue-457512428).\r\n\r\n**5. Emon nwdFracLut #469**\r\nRemoved from the json data request files. Hopefully a `1.2.x` version will include a fix. Then `Emon nwdFracLut`needs to be included by `genecec` in the json data request files again.\r\n\r\n**6. wap_6hrPlev & zg_6hrPlevPt not passing PrePARE #462**\r\nRemains currently an open issue at [PCMDI](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmor/issues/502).\r\n\r\n**7 & 8. Zonal means & climatologies #262 in `v1.3.0`**\r\nSee overview of skipped variables and ece2cmor log errors in #500.\r\n",
