The binary file format in OpenFOAM is \"special\". It is the same as the ASCII based text format, except where large blocks of floating point data are concerned. \n* You just need to parse some text: use `pyparsing`, it is the industry's standard. \n* You need to tinker with large binary OpenFOAM files directly from Python.\n* There is a different package that does not adhere to data standards and hacked together its own mixed ASCII/binary file format. You will have to roll out your own parser. Byteparsing can make this easier. \n* Works with `mmap` and `numpy`! This means you can open the file without reading it entirely into memory, change the NumPy array data and the changes are automatically saved to disk.\n \n"
