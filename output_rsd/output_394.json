The instructions below will guide you though the steps\nrequired.\n\n## Configure the python package for development and testing\n\nTo contribute to the development of the python package, we recommend installing\nthe package in development mode.\n\n\n### Installation\n\nFirst, clone this repository:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing.git\n```\n\nThen install the package (On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`):\n\n```sh\ncd STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing\npython3 -m install -e .[dev]\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nThe testing framework used here is [PyTest](https://pytest.org). You can run\ntests as (On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3`):\n\n```sh\npython3 -m pytest\n```\n\n### Building the documentation\n\nTo edit the documentation locally, do:\n\n```sh\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\nThen open the local hyperlink displayed in the terminal, e.g.:\n```\nINFO     -  [13:23:44] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n```\n\n### Run formatting tools\n\nYou can use `prospector` to get information about errors, potential problems and convention violations. To run:\n\n```sh\nprospector\n```\n\nTo format the import statements, you can use `isort` as:\n\n```sh\nisort\n```\n\n## Development of STEMMUS_SCOPE model\n\n<!-- markdown-link-check-disable-next-line -->\nTo contribute to the STEMMUS_SCOPE model, you need access to the model source code that is stored in the repository [STEMMUS_SCOPE](https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE).\n"

MATLAB and MATLAB Runtime are\ninstalled on Snellius, see the script\n[`run_jupyter_lab_snellius.sh`](https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing/blob/main/run_jupyter_lab_snellius.sh)\non how to load the module. Also, use the same script to create a jupyter lab\nserver for running notebooks interactively. The script activates the conda\nenvironment `pystemmusscope`. Make sure that you create the `pystemmusscope`\nconda environment before submitting the the bash script. See\n[Create pystemmusscope conda environment](#create-pystemmusscope-conda-environment).\n\n## On CRIB\n\n[CRIB](https://crib.utwente.nl/) is the ITC Geospatial Computing Platform. You\ncan run the model using `Matlab` or `Octave`. Currently, running the\nexceutable file on CRIB is not supported because MATLAB Runtime can not be\ninstalled there. See [Install PyStemmusScope](#install-pystemmusscope).\n\n## On your own machine\n\nChoose how do you want to run the model, see [Run the model](notebooks/run_model_on_different_infra.ipynb).\n\n## Install PyStemmusScope\n\nRun the commands below in a terminal (On Windows, use `python` instead of\n`python3`):\n\n```sh\npython3 -m pip install pystemmusscope\n```\n\nor\n\nOpen a jupyter notebook and run the code below in a cell:\n\n```python\n!pip install pystemmusscope\n```\n\n## Install jupyterlab\n\nJupyterlab is needed to run notebooks. Run the commands below in a terminal:\n\n```sh\npython3 -m pip install jupyterlab\n\n```\n\nOpen a terminal, make sure the environment is activated. Then, run `jupyter lab`:\n\n```sh\njupyter lab\n```\n\nJupyterLab will open automatically in your browser. Now, you can run the\nnotebook\n[run_model_on_different_infra.ipynb](https://github.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing/blob/main/docs/notebooks/run_model_on_different_infra.ipynb).\n\n## Install MATLAB Runtime\n\nTo run the STEMMUS_SCOPE, you need MATLAB Runtime version `2021a` and a Unix-like system.\n\nIn a terminal:\n\n```sh\n# Download MATLAB Runtime for Linux\nwget https://ssd.mathworks.com/supportfiles/downloads/R2021a/Release/6/deployment_files/installer/complete/glnxa64/MATLAB_Runtime_R2021a_Update_6_glnxa64.zip\n\n# Unzip the file\nunzip MATLAB_Runtime_R2021a_Update_6_glnxa64.zip -d MATLAB_Runtime\n\n# Install it\ncd MATLAB_Runtime\nsudo -H ./install -mode silent -agreeToLicense yes\n```\n\nFor more information on how to download and install MATLAB Runtime, see the links below:\n  - [download](https://nl.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html)\n  - [installation](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/compiler/install-the-matlab-runtime.html)\n\n## Install WSL\n\nAs the STEMMUS-SCOPE executable only supports Unix-like systems, Windows users\ncannot run STEMMUS-SCOPE natively. However, users of Windows 10 and newer can\nuse WSL ([Windows Subsystem for\nLinux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)) to run the model.\nCheck the <a\nhref=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install\">Microsoft Guide</a>\nfor a compatibility information and for general WSL instructions.\nIf no installation exists, a Ubuntu distribution can be installed using the following commands:\n```sh\nwsl --install\n```\n\nAfter installation, you can start up the WSL instance and update the default software:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n```\n\nYou can now set up a python environment using either python's `venv`, or use Conda/Mamba.\nNote that the command to run python and pip can be `python3` and `pip3` by default.\n\nFor the rest of the installation instructions simply follow the steps below.\nNote that it is possible to access files from the Windows filesystem from within\nWSL, by accessing, e.g., `/mnt/c/` instead of `C:\\`. This means that large input\ndata files can be stored on your Windows installation instead of inside the WSL\ndistro. However, WSL does not have write permission. Therefore, output data will\nbe stored within WSL. Make sure that `WorkDir` in the model config file is set\ncorrectly.\n\n## Create pystemmusscope conda environment\n\nIf a conda environment is needed, run the commands below in a terminal:\n\n```sh\n# Download and install Mamba on linux\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-x86_64.sh\nbash Mambaforge-pypy3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/mamba\n\n# Update base environment\n. ~/mamba/bin/activate\nmamba update --name base mamba\n\n# Download environment file\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EcoExtreML/STEMMUS_SCOPE_Processing/main/environment.yml\n\n# Create a conda environment called 'pystemmusscope' with all required dependencies\nmamba env create -f environment.yml\n\n# The environment can be activated with\n. ~/mamba/bin/activate pystemmusscope\n\n```\n"
