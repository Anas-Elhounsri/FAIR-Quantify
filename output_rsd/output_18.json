Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you want to contribute a project;\n1. you want to use the projects in the platform;\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation).\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You want to contribute a project\n\nYou are free to add projects on [https://pairedomicsdata.bioinformatics.nl/add](https://pairedomicsdata.bioinformatics.nl/add).\nAfter submission, the project will be reviewed and if approved will appear in the [list of projects](https://pairedomicsdata.bioinformatics.nl/projects).\n\n## You want to use the data in the platform\n\nEach project page on [https://pairedomicsdata.bioinformatics.nl](https://pairedomicsdata.bioinformatics.nl) has a download button, which gives you the JSON document of the project.\n\nTo access the platform in a programmatic manner see the [developer manual](manuals/developers.md).\n\nPlease inform us if you found a nice way to use the data.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/iomega/paired-data-form/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n1. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/iomega/paired-data-form/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community _before you start working_. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. setup development environment by following instructions in [api/README.md](api/README.md) and [app/README.md](app/README.md);\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``npm run test`` in `api/` and/or `app/` directory;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch to (your fork of) the Python Template repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n"

The application offers full text search functionality via web services using an elastic search (v7.6.2) index. The web service uses a redis queue (v5.0.5) to schedule jobs to fetch more information about the public identifiers and to upload the projects to Zenodo each month. For example, the scientific species name is fetched from GenBank using the public genome identifiers in the project. The web service has an OpenAPI (v3.0.3) specification ([https://www.openapis.org/](https://www.openapis.org/)) which can be used to submit and retrieve projects in a programmatic manner. The platform runs using Docker Compose (v1.25.4) with containers for the web application, web service and redis queue.\n \n"
