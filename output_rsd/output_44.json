[MPI]` The MPI is optional. \n- Going back to the working directory (`cd ..`) also clone the OMUSE repository: `git clone https://github.com/omuse-geoscience/omuse`,\n- go into the source directory `cd omuse` and set the environment variable `DOWNLOAD_CODES`, e.g. `export DOWNLOAD_CODES=latest`.\n- now, do `pip install -e .` from the root of the package\n- type `python setup.py build_codes --inplace` to build the codes. \n- the file `build.log` will report any errors in the build process.\n\nThis installs amuse-devel and omuse-devel. The community codes of OMUSE can \nbe build manually by going into each directory:\n\n + src/omuse/community/adcirc\n + src/omuse/community/swan\n + etc\n\nand typing: first `make download` (for some) and then `make`\n\nOMUSE has been tested on OSX and linux machines, with ifort and gfortran \ncompilers, on desktop machines and on the Carthesius supercomputer.\n\nIn addition to the AMUSE dependencies, OMUSE needs/ can use the following \npackages:\n\n + matplotlib basemap\n + netCDF and netCDF for fortran and the python bindings\n + GRIB_API\n"

[MPI]` The MPI is optional. \n- Going back to the working directory (`cd ..`) also clone the OMUSE repository: `git clone https://github.com/omuse-geoscience/omuse`,\n- go into the source directory `cd omuse` and set the environment variable `DOWNLOAD_CODES`, e.g. `export DOWNLOAD_CODES=latest`.\n- now, do `pip install -e .` from the root of the package\n- type `python setup.py build_codes --inplace` to build the codes. \n- the file `build.log` will report any errors in the build process.\n\nThis installs amuse-devel and omuse-devel. The community codes of OMUSE can \nbe build manually by going into each directory:\n\n + src/omuse/community/adcirc\n + src/omuse/community/swan\n + etc\n\nand typing: first `make download` (for some) and then `make`\n\nOMUSE has been tested on OSX and linux machines, with ifort and gfortran \ncompilers, on desktop machines and on the Carthesius supercomputer.\n\nIn addition to the AMUSE dependencies, OMUSE needs/ can use the following \npackages:\n\n + matplotlib basemap\n + netCDF and netCDF for fortran and the python bindings\n + GRIB_API\n"
