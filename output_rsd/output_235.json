Distributing computational expensive\nsimulations among the available resources, avoiding duplication and keeping the data safe are challenges\nthat scientists face every day. \nCeiba and its command line interface `Ceiba-cli <https://github.com/nlesc-nano/ceiba-cli>`_\nsolve the problem of computing, storing and securely sharing\ncomputationally expensive simulation results. Researchers can save significant time and resources by easily\ncomputing new data and reusing existing simulation data to answer their questions. \nSee `documentation <https://ceiba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and `blog post <https://blog.esciencecenter.nl/building-a-web-service-to-manage-scientific-simulation-data-using-graphql-a0bbf1c3f6e9>`_. \nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at \nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License. \n"
