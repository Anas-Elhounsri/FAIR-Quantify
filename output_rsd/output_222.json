Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation);\n1. you want to make a new release of the code base.\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/point-cloud-radar/bird-cloud-gnn/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n3. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/point-cloud-radar/bird-cloud-gnn/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``pytest``;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with change;\n1. push your feature branch to (your fork of) the bird_cloud_gnn repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n"

In this context, we adopted such an approach by acquiring a graph representation from point cloud data. Depending on the chosen parameters, this transformation can augment the dataset by a factor of up to 1000. Subsequently, this graph representation is harnessed as input for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs are highly sought after due to their innate ability to adeptly capture and leverage the inherent properties of graph-structured data. They excel in modeling intricate network relationships, autonomously acquiring informative features, and facilitating effective knowledge transfer.\n \n"
