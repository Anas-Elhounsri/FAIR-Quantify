The complexity of the calculations usually requires\nintercommunication between the aforementioned tools, such communication is usually done\nthrough shell scripts that try to automate input/output actions like: launching\nthe computations in a cluster, reading the resulting output and feeding the relevant\nnumerical result to another program. Such scripts are difficult to maintain and extend,\nrequiring a significant programming expertise to work with them. Being then desirable a\nset of automatic and extensible tools that allows to perform complex simulations in\nheterogeneous hardware platforms. \nThis library tackles the construction and efficient execution of computational chemistry workflows.\nThis allows computational chemists to use the emerging massively parallel compute environments in\nan easy manner and focus on interpretation of scientific data rather than on tedious job submission\nprocedures and manual data processing.\n \n"
