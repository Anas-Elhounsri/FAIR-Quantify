Here's how to set up `tsdf` for local development.\n\n1. Download a copy of `tsdf` locally.\n2. Install `tsdf` using `poetry`:\n\n    ```console\n    $ poetry install\n    ```\n\n3. Create a branch for local development:\n\n    ```console\n    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature\n    ```\n\n4. Make your changes and ensure they meet the code formatting and documentation standards.\n\n5. Check that your changes pass all tests.\n\n6. Commit your changes and push to the branch:\n\n    ```console\n    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature\n    ```\n\n7. Submit a pull request through GitHub.\n\n## Pull Request Guidelines\n\nBefore you submit a pull request, ensure it meets these guidelines:\n\n1. The pull request should include tests that prove any new functionality works as expected.\n2. If the pull request adds functionality, the documentation should be updated accordingly.\n3. The pull request should work for Python's currently supported versions and major operating systems.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the `tsdf` project is released with a Code of Conduct. By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\n"

Download or clone the content from [our repository](https://github.com/biomarkersParkinson/tsdf).\n2. Browse to the folder you just downloaded (typically: `cd tsdf/`).\n3. Install using your package manager (typically: `pip install .`).\n\n## What now?\n\nNow you can import functions from the `tsdf` Python package.\nSee some examples in the [usage section](/basic_reading_and_writing_numpy).\n"
