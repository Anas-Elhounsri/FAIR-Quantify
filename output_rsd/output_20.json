Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n1. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n1. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation);\n1. you want to make a new release of the code base.\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;\n1. apply the \"Question\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality [here](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;\n1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:\n    - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;\n    - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;\n    - information about the operating system;\n1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form of a (new) issue;\n1. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about your idea being a good idea;\n1. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest master commit. While working on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the master branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the 'upstream' repository (follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n1. make sure the existing tests still work by running ``pytest``;\n1. add your own tests (if necessary);\n1. update or expand the documentation;\n1. update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with change;\n1. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/>) your feature branch to (your fork of) the matchms repository on GitHub;\n1. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you've made a valuable contribution, but you don't know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the documentation: don't let this discourage you from making the pull request; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but keep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to your pull request.\n\n## You want to make a new release of the code base\n\nTo create release you need write permission on the repository.\n\n1. Check author list in `citation.cff` and `.zenodo.json` files\n1. Bump the version using `poetry version <major|minor|patch>`. For example, `poetry version major` will increase major version numbers everywhere its needed (code, meta, etc.) in the repo. Alternatively the verion can be manually changed in __version__.py and pyproject.toml\n1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` to include changes made\n1. Goto [GitHub release page](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/releases)\n1. Press draft a new release button\n1. Fill version, title and description field\n1. Press the Publish Release button\n1. Wait until [PyPi publish workflow](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/actions/workflows/CI_publish_pypi.yml) has completed\n1. Verify new release is on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/matchms/#history)\n1. Wait until new release is also on Bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/matchms) via a automaticly created PR on [bioconda recipes repo](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+matchms)\n1. Test matchms from bioconda by manually running [Conda verify](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/actions/workflows/conda_verify.yml) workflow\n\nAlso a Zenodo entry will be made for the release with its own DOI.\n"

        "value": "Matchms is a versatile open-source Python package developed for importing, processing, cleaning, and comparing mass spectrometry data (MS/MS). It facilitates the implementation of straightforward, reproducible workflows, transforming raw data from common mass spectra file formats into pre- and post-processed spectral data, and enabling large-scale spectral similarity comparisons. \nThe software supports a range of popular spectral data formats, including mzML, mzXML, msp, metabolomics-USI, MGF, and JSON. Matchms offers an array of tools for metadata cleaning and validation, alongside basic peak filtering, to ensure data accuracy and integrity. A key feature of matchms is its ability to apply various pairwise similarity measures for comparing extensive amounts of spectra. This encompasses not only common Cosine-related scores but also molecular fingerprint-based comparisons and other metadata-related assessments. \nOne of the strengths of matchms is its extensibility, allowing users to integrate custom similarity measures. Notable examples of spectrum similarity measures tailored for Matchms include `Spec2Vec `_ and `MS2DeepScore `_. Additionally, Matchms enhances efficiency by using faster similarity measures for initial pre-selection and supports storing results in sparse data formats, enabling the comparison of several hundred thousands of spectra. This combination of features positions Matchms as a comprehensive tool for mass spectrometry data analysis. \nIf you use matchms in your research, please cite the following software papers:   \nF Huber, S.

To automatically save in the specified file format. [#543](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/543)\r\n- Add saving function in SpectrumProcessor [#543](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/543)\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fixed bug when loading empty metadata in msp [#548](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/548)\r\n- Handle missing `precursor_mz` in representation and [#452](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/452) introduced by [#514](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/514/files)[#540](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/540)\r\n- Fixed retention time harmonization for msp files [#551](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/551)\r\n- Fix closing mgf file after loading and prevent reopening. [#555](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/555)\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Renamed derive_smiles_from_pubchem_compound_name_search to derive_annotation_from_compound_name. [#559](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/559)\r\n- Derive_annotation_from_compound_name does not add smile or inchi when this cannot be interpreted by rdkit. [#559](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/559)\r\n- Refactored SpectrumProcessor. Reduced code repetition and improved modularity. Matchms filters can now be added as functions and in a different position than specified. [#565](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/565)\r\n- The default pipelines now stores matchms functions instead of string representation. [#565](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/565)\r\n- The option to add predefined pipelines to SpectrumProcessor has been removed. Predefined pipelines can now just be added by adding the default_pipelines (which is a list) to the filters parameter. [#565](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/565)\r\n\r\n### PR's since previous release\r\n* Fixed string representation and added testcase for issue 452 by @hechth in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/540\r\n* Enable setting key conversion with static method by @hechth in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/547\r\n* Update require_parent_mass_match_smiles.py by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/552\r\n* add export_style parameter by @florian-huber in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/557\r\n* Fix wrong pubchem annotations by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/559\r\n* Switch to tmp_path by @florian-huber in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/566\r\n* Prevent accidental file overwriting by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/543\r\n* Fix retention time for msp by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/553\r\n* Fix issue with parse metadata recognizing empty metadata as well. by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/554\r\n* Create new predefined pipelines, with subgroups and update tests. by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/562\r\n* Fix repair not matching annotation by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/558\r\n* Remove predefined pipelines by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/565\r\n* Change require_minimum_of_high_peaks to require_minimum_number_of_hig\u2026 by @niekdejonge in https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/573\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/matchms/matchms/compare/0.23.1...0.24.0",

        "description": "# matchms 0.18.0\r\n\r\nThis represents a major update of matchms with several potential breaking changes. Two main shifts are the addition of a Pipeline API (using a new `Pipeline` class) and the novel underlying representation of scores by sparse arrays (in `Scores`).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- new `Pipeline` class to define entire matchms workflows. This includes importing one or several datasets, processing using matchms filtering/processing functions as well as similartiy computations. Also allows to import/export workflows as yaml files.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- major change of `Scores` class. Internally, scores are now stored as a stacked sparse array. This allows to store several different scores for spectrum-spectrums pairs in an efficient way. Also makes it possible to run large-scale comparisons in particular when pipelines start with rapid selective similarity scoring methods such as MetadataMatch or PrecursorMzMatch.\r\n- Scoring/similarity methods now also get a `.sparse_array()` method (next to the previous `.pair()` and `.matrix()` methods).\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- minor fix in `interpret_pepmass` function.",

        "description": "# matchms 0.14.0\r\n\r\nThis is the first of a few releases to work our way towards matchms 1.0.0, which also means that a few things in the API will likely change. Here the main change is that `Spectrum.metadata` is no longer a simple Python dictionary but became a `Metadata` object. In this context metadata field-names/keys will now be harmonized by default (e.g. \"Precursor Mass\" will become \"precursor_mz). For list of conversions see [matchms key conversion table](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/master/matchms/data/known_key_conversions.csv).\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- new `MetadataMatch`similarity measure in matchms.similarity. This can be used to find matches between metadata entries and currently supports either full string matches or matches of numerical entries within a specified tolerance [#315](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/315)\r\n- metadata is now stored using new `Metadata` class which automatically applied restrictions to used field names/keys to avoid confusion between different format styles [#293](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/293)\r\n- all metadata keys must be lower-case, spaces will be changed to underscores.\r\n- Known key conversions are applied to metadata entries using a [matchms key conversion table](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/blob/master/matchms/data/known_key_conversions.csv)\r\n- new `interpret_pepmass()` filter to handle different pepmass entries found in data [#298][https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/298] \r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Metadata harmonization will now happen by default! This includes changing field name style and applying known key conversions. To avoid the key conversions user have to make this explicit by setting `metadata_harmonization=False` [#293](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/293)\r\n- `Spikes` class has become `Fragments` class [#293](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/293)\r\n- Change import style (now: isort 5 and slightly different style) [#323](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/pull/323)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- can now handle charges that come as a string of type \"2+\" or \"1-\" [#301](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/301)\r\n- new `Metadata`class fixes issue of equality check for different entry orders [#285](https://github.com/matchms/matchms/issues/285)",
