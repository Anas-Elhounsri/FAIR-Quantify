Please\nread and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nA contribution can be one of the following cases:\n\n1. you have a question;\n2. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);\n3. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a\n    bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation).\n4. you want to make a release\n\nThe sections below outline the steps in each case.\n\n## You have a question\n\n1. use the search functionality\n    [here](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/setup-apptainer/issues) to see if\n    someone already filed the same issue;\n2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new\n    issue;\n3. apply the \\\"Question\\\" label; apply other labels when relevant.\n\n## You think you may have found a bug\n\n1. use the search functionality\n    [here](https://github.com/eWaterCycle/setup-apptainer/issues) to see if\n    someone already filed the same issue;\n2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new\n    issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the\n    community to understand the cause and context of the problem.\n    Depending on the issue, you may want to include: - the [SHA\n    hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas)\n    of the commit that is causing your problem; - some identifying\n    information (name and version number) for dependencies you\\'re\n    using; - information about the operating system;\n3. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.\n\n## You want to make some kind of change to the code base\n\n1. (**important**) announce your plan to the rest of the community\n    *before you start working*. This announcement should be in the form\n    of a (new) issue;\n2. (**important**) wait until some kind of consensus is reached about\n    your idea being a good idea;\n3. if needed, fork the repository to your own Github profile and create\n    your own feature branch off of the latest main commit. While working\n    on your feature branch, make sure to stay up to date with the main\n    branch by pulling in changes, possibly from the \\'upstream\\'\n    repository (follow the instructions\n    [here](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/)\n    and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/));\n4. install the package dependencies with\n    `npm install`;\n5. make sure the existing tests still work by running `npm run test`;\n6. add your own tests (if necessary);\n7. update or expand the documentation; Make sure the `inputs` in [action.yml](action.yml) file are in-sync with their descriptions in [README.md#inputs](README.md#inputs);\n8. [push](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) your feature branch\n    to (your fork of) the ewatercycle repository on GitHub;\n9. create the pull request, e.g. following the instructions\n    [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\nIn case you feel like you\\'ve made a valuable contribution, but you\ndon\\'t know how to write or run tests for it, or how to generate the\ndocumentation: don\\'t let this discourage you from making the pull\nrequest; we can help you! Just go ahead and submit the pull request, but\nkeep in mind that you might be asked to append additional commits to\nyour pull request.\n\n## You want to make a release\n\nThis section is for maintainers of the setup-apptainer action.\n\n### Build\n\n> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 20, for instance.\n\nInstall the dependencies  \n```bash\n$ npm install\n```\n\nBuild the typescript and package it for distribution\n```bash\n$ npm run build && npm run package\n```\n\n### Publish\n\nActions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder. \n\nThen build (transpile Typescript to Javascript), package (bundle dependencies and code together) and push the results:\n```bash\n$ npm run build && npm run package\n$ git add dist\n$ git commit -a -m \"prod dependencies\"\n$ git push\n```\n\nCreate a release on https://github.com/eWaterCycle/setup-apptainer/releases/new with semantic versioning.\n\nFollowing the [documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md), add a short tag, such that the major version tag points to the latest stable release for that major version:\n```\ngit pull\ngit tag -fa v2 -m \"Update v2 tag\"\ngit push origin v2 --force\n```\n\nYour action is now published! :rocket: \n"
