Add `CONDA_INSTALL = ~/miniconda3`  above `CONDA = $(CONDA_INSTALL)/bin/conda` in the Makefile to avoid this issue. You can also use the below command to move the miniconda3 installation to the correct location.\n\n```bash\nbash bin/miniconda_install.sh -f -b -u -p ~/miniconda3\n```\n\nyq >= 4 is required, but the conda version is outdated.  Install the latest version system-wide by following the instructions at [the yq GitHub](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/#install).\n\nContinue to [Configure .env](#configure-.env) section below\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>For Apple Silicon</summary>\n\n### 1. Install OS Dependencies\n\n- Install dependencies\n\n```bash\nbrew install gettext\nbrew link --force gettext\nbrew install jq\nbrew install yq\n```\n\n- Get [Docker Desktop for Apple Silicon](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/). Be sure to start it.\n\n### 2. Initialize CanDIGv2 Repo\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b develop https://github.com/CanDIG/CanDIGv2.git\ncd CanDIGv2\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\ncp -i etc/env/example.env .env\n```\n\n### 3. Update .env file\n\n```bash\n# find out your ip and add to LOCAL_IP_ADDR\nLOCAL_IP_ADDR=xxx.xx.x.x\n# change OS\nVENV_OS=arm64mac\n```\n\nEdit /etc/hosts on the machine (`sudo nano /etc/hosts`):\n\n```bash\n::1 candig.docker.internal\n```\n\n### 4. Initialize conda\n\n```bash\nmake bin-all\nmake init-conda\nconda activate candig\n```\n\n### 5. Build and test\n\n```bash\nmake build-all\nmake test-integration\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Initialize CanDIGv2 Repo\n\n\n### 1. Initialize repo and submodules\n```bash\ngit clone -b develop https://github.com/CanDIG/CanDIGv2.git\ncd CanDIGv2\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n### 2. Copy and edit .env with your site's local configuration\n\n\n```\ncp -i etc/env/example.env .env\n```\n\nUpdate any of the information you want or need to customize including:\n\n```bash\n# find out your ip and add to LOCAL_IP_ADDR\nLOCAL_IP_ADDR=xxx.xx.x.x\n# change OS\nVENV_OS=<your OS>\n```\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>More info about the `.env` Environment File</summary>\n\nYou need an `.env` file in the project root directory, which contains a set of global variables that are used as reference to the various parameters, plugins, and config options that operators can modify for testing purposes. This repo contains an example `.env` file in `etc/env/example.env`.\n\nFor a basic desktop sandbox setup, the example variable file needs very little (if any) modification.\n\nWhen deploying CanDIGv2\nusing `make`, `.env` is imported by `make` and all uncommented variables are added as environment variables via\n`export`.\n\nSome of the functionality that is controlled through `.env` are:\n\n* operating system flags\n* change docker network, driver, and swarm host\n* modify ports, protocols, and plugins for various services\n* version control and app pinning\n* pre-defined defaults for turnkey deployment\n\nEnvironment variables defined in the `.env` file can be read in `docker-compose` scripts through the variable substitution operator\n`${VAR}`.\n\n```yaml\n# example compose YAML using variable substitution with default option\nservices:\n  consul:\n    image: progrium/consul\n    network_mode: ${DOCKER_MODE}\n...\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### 3. option A: install miniconda and initialize candig virtualenv\n\nUse this option for systems installations. It installs miniconda in the candigv2 repo.\n\n```bash\nmake bin-conda  # If this fails on WSL, see the Note for WSL Systems section above\nmake init-conda\n```\n\n### 3. option B. Use an existing Conda installation\n\nIf you want to use an existing conda installation on your local at the bottom of the [.env](../etc/env/example.env#L310), set `CONDA_INSTALL` to your existing conda installation path\n\n```bash\nmake mkdir # skip most of bin-conda, but need the dir-creating step\nmake init-conda\n```\n\n### 4. Activate the candig virtualenv. It may be necessary to restart your shell before doing this\n\n```bash\nconda activate candig\n```\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Configuring CanDIG modules</summary>\n\nNot all CanDIG modules are required for a minimal installation. The `CANDIG_MODULES` setting defines which modules are included in the deployment.\n\nBy default (if you copy the sample file from `etc/env/example.env`) the installation includes the minimal list of modules:\n\n```\n  CANDIG_MODULES=logging keycloak vault redis postgres htsget katsu query tyk opa federation candig-ingest candig-data-portal\n```\n\nOptional modules follow the `#` and include various monitoring components, workflow execution, and some older modules not generally installed.\n </details>\n\n## Build and compose all the modules\n\n`install-all` will perform all of the steps to deploy CanDIG including the conda install, building images explicitly. \n\n> [!IMPORTANT] \n> On Mac M1, you will not be able to use make install-all; instead, use the conda installation instructions as described above. Build-all will then build and compose the containers for you.\n\n\n```bash\nmake install-all\n```\n\n`build-all` will do the same without running `bin-conda` and `init-conda`:\n\n```bash\nmake build-all\n```\n\nOnce everything has run without errors, take a look at the documentation for\n[ingesting data and testing the deployment](ingest-and-test.md) as well as [Interacting with the stack using Make](interact-with-the-stack.md)\nand if you are a developer: [how to modify code and test changes](docker-and-submodules.md) in\nthe context of the CanDIG stack.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBelow are some common issues that our users have encountered. If you run into any other issues not addressed here, please reach out via a github issue in this repo.\n\nOn some machines (MacOS), if you get an error something like:\n```\nPlease ensure the value of $CANDIG_DOMAIN in your .env file points to this machine\nThis should either be: 1) your local IP address, as assigned by your local network, or\n2) a domain name that resolves to this IP address\n```\nit may be necessary to add the following to `/etc/hosts`:\n\nIn a terminal, run the following commands\n```\nsudo nano /etc/hosts\n```\n\nThen add the following line at the bottom of the file and save the changes:\n\n```\n::1\tcandig.docker.internal\n```\n\nIn some other cases, it may be necessary to add your local/internal (network) IP manually, if the build process complains that it could not find the right IP (`ERROR: Your internet adapter could not be found automatically.` or `ERROR: More than one IP has been detected.`). In this case, find out what your local IP address is\n\n```bash\n# on mac\nifconfig en0 | awk '$1 == \"inet\" {print $2}'\n# on linux\nip route | awk -F\\  '/default/ {print $9}'\n```\n\nThen edit your .env file with:\n\n```bash\nLOCAL_IP_ADDR=<your local IP>\n```\nWhere `<your local IP>` is your local network IP (e.g. 192.168.x.x)\n\nIf you can see the data portal at http://candig.docker.internal:5080/, your installation was successful.\n\nConfirm your installation with the [automatic tests](/docs/ingest-and-test.md).\n\n\n### Update Firewall\n\nIf the command still fails, it may be necessary to disable your local firewall, or edit it to allow requests from all ports used in the Docker stack.\n\nEdit your firewall settings to allow connections from those adresses:\n\n```bash\nexport DOCKER_BRIDGE_IP=$(docker network inspect bridge | grep Subnet | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d ',')\nsudo ufw allow from $DOCKER_BRIDGE_IP to <your ip>\n```\n\nRe-run `make clean-authx` and `make init-authx` and it should work.\n"

Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary."
