The workflow is easy to use and deploy on any Linux-based machine. In particular, the workflow supports automated software deployment, easy configuration and addition of new analysis tools as well as enables to scale from a single computer to different HPC clusters with minimal effort.\n \n"

Clone this repo.**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/GooglingTheCancerGenome/sv-callers.git\ncd sv-callers\n```\n\n**2. Install dependencies.**\n\n```bash\n# download Miniconda3 installer\nwget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh\n# install Conda (respond by 'yes')\nbash miniconda.sh\n# update Conda\nconda update -y conda\n# install Mamba\nconda install -n base -c conda-forge -y mamba\n# create a new environment with dependencies & activate it\nmamba env create -n wf -f environment.yaml\nconda activate wf\n```\n\n**3. Configure the workflow.**\n\n-   **config files**:\n    -   [`analysis.yaml`](/config/analysis.yaml) - analysis-specific settings (e.g., workflow mode, I/O files, SV callers, post-processing or resources used etc.)\n    -   [`samples.csv`](/config/samples.csv) - list of (paired) samples\n\n-   **input files**:\n    -   example data in `workflow/data` directory\n    -   reference genome in `.fasta` (incl. index files)\n    -   excluded regions in `.bed` (optional)\n    -   WGS samples in `.bam` (incl. index files)\n\n-   **output files**:\n    -   (filtered) SVs per caller and merged calls in `.vcf` (incl. index files)\n\n**4. Execute the workflow.**\n\n```bash\ncd workflow\n```\n\n_Locally_\n\n```bash\n# 'dry' run only checks I/O files\nsnakemake -np\n\n# 'vanilla' run if echo_run set to 1 (default) in analysis.yaml,\n# it merely mimics the execution of SV callers by writing (dummy) VCF files;\n# SV calling if echo_run set to 0\nsnakemake --use-conda --jobs\n\n```\n\n_Submit jobs to Slurm or GridEngine cluster_\n\n```bash\nSCH=slurm   # or gridengine\nsnakemake  --use-conda --latency-wait 30 --jobs \\\n--cluster \"xenon scheduler $SCH --location local:// submit --name smk.{rule} --inherit-env --cores-per-task {threads} --max-run-time 1 --max-memory {resources.mem_mb} --working-directory . --stderr stderr-%j.log --stdout stdout-%j.log\" &>smk.log&\n```\n\nNote: One sample or a tumor/normal pair generates in total 18 SV calling and post-processing jobs. See the workflow instance of [single-sample](doc/sv-callers_single.svg) (germline) or [paired-sample](doc/sv-callers_paired.svg) (somatic) analysis.\n\nTo perform SV calling:\n-   edit (default) parameters in `analysis.yaml`\n    -   set `echo_run` to `0`\n    -   choose between two workflow `mode`s: single- (`s`) or paired-sample (`p` - default)\n    -   select one or more callers using `enable_callers` (default all)\n\n-   use `xenon` CLI to set:\n    -   `--max-run-time` of workflow jobs (in minutes)\n    -   `--temp-space` (optional, in MB)\n\n-   adjust compute requirements per SV caller according to the system used:\n    -   the number of `threads`, \n    -   the amount of `memory`(in MB),\n    -   the amount of temporary disk space or `tmpspace` (path in `TMPDIR` env variable) can be used for intermediate files by LUMPY and GRIDSS only.\n\n_Query job accounting information_\n\n```bash\nSCH=slurm   # or gridengine\nxenon --json scheduler $SCH --location local:// list --identifier [jobID] | jq ...\n```\n"
