While\n  deep learning can be a useful tool for researchers from a\n  wide range of domains, taking the first steps in the world\n  of deep learning can be somewhat intimidating. \n\n\n  This introduction aims to cover the basics of deep\n  learning in a practical and hands-on manner, \n\n  so that upon completion, students will be able to train\n  their first neural network and understand what next steps\n  to take to improve the model.\nkeywords:\n  - deep learning\n  - python\n  - keras\n  - neural networks\n  - tensorflow\n  - research software\nlicense: CC-BY-4.0\n"

        "value": "## Contributing\n\n[The Carpentries][cp-site] ([Software Carpentry][swc-site], [Data\nCarpentry][dc-site], and [Library Carpentry][lc-site]) are open source\nprojects, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: new lessons, fixes to\nexisting material, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all\nwelcome.\n\n### Contributor Agreement\n\nBy contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under [our\nlicense](LICENSE.md). In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess\nyour change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our\ncommunity. Everyone involved in [The Carpentries][cp-site] agrees to abide by\nour [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### How to Contribute\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about a spelling\nmistake, some awkward wording, or a factual error. This is a good way to\nintroduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.\n\n1. If you do not have a [GitHub][github] account, you can [send us comments by\n   email][contact]. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use\n   one of the other methods described below.\n\n2. If you have a [GitHub][github] account, or are willing to [create\n   one][github-join], but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems\n   or suggest improvements by [creating an issue][issues]. This allows us to\n   assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.\n\n3. If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to add or change material,\n   you can submit a pull request (PR). Instructions for doing this are\n   [included below](#using-github).\n\nNote: if you want to build the website locally, please refer to [The Workbench\ndocumentation][template-doc].\n\n### Where to Contribute\n\n1. If you wish to change this lesson, add issues and pull requests here.\n2. If you wish to change the template used for workshop websites, please refer\n   to [The Workbench documentation][template-doc].\n\n\n### What to Contribute\n\nThere are many ways to contribute, from writing new exercises and improving\nexisting ones to updating or filling in the documentation and submitting [bug\nreports][issues] about things that do not work, are not clear, or are missing.\nIf you are looking for ideas, please see [the list of issues for this\nrepository][repo], or the issues for [Data Carpentry][dc-issues], [Library\nCarpentry][lc-issues], and [Software Carpentry][swc-issues] projects.\n\nComments on issues and reviews of pull requests are just as welcome: we are\nsmarter together than we are on our own. **Reviews from novices and newcomers\nare particularly valuable**: it's easy for people who have been using these\nlessons for a while to forget how impenetrable some of this material can be, so\nfresh eyes are always welcome.\n\n### What *Not* to Contribute\n\nOur lessons already contain more material than we can cover in a typical\nworkshop, so we are usually *not* looking for more concepts or tools to add to\nthem. As a rule, if you want to introduce a new idea, you must (a) estimate how\nlong it will take to teach and (b) explain what you would take out to make room\nfor it. The first encourages contributors to be honest about requirements; the\nsecond, to think hard about priorities.\n\nWe are also not looking for exercises or other material that only run on one\nplatform. Our workshops typically contain a mixture of Windows, macOS, and\nLinux users; in order to be usable, our lessons must run equally well on all\nthree.\n\n### Using GitHub\n\nIf you choose to contribute via GitHub, you may want to look at [How to\nContribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][how-contribute]. In brief, we\nuse [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:\n\n1. Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each\n   significant change.\n2. Commit the change in that branch.\n3. Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.\n4. Submit a pull request from that branch to the [upstream repository][repo].\n5. If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your\n   branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.\n\nNB: The published copy of the lesson is usually in the `main` branch.\n\nEach lesson has a team of maintainers who review issues and pull requests or\nencourage others to do so. The maintainers are community volunteers, and have\nfinal say over what gets merged into the lesson.\n\n### Other Resources\n\nThe Carpentries is a global organisation with volunteers and learners all over\nthe world. We share values of inclusivity and a passion for sharing knowledge,\nteaching and learning. There are several ways to connect with The Carpentries\ncommunity listed at <https://carpentries.org/connect/> including via social\nmedia, slack, newsletters, and email lists. You can also [reach us by\nemail][contact].\n\n[repo]: https://example.com/FIXME\n[contact]: mailto:team@carpentries.org\n[cp-site]: https://carpentries.org/\n[dc-issues]: https://github.com/issues?q=user%3Adatacarpentry\n[dc-lessons]: https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/\n[dc-site]: https://datacarpentry.org/\n[discuss-list]: https://lists.software-carpentry.org/listinfo/discuss\n[github]: https://github.com\n[github-flow]: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/\n[github-join]: https://github.com/join\n[how-contribute]: https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github\n[issues]: https://carpentries.org/help-wanted-issues/\n[lc-issues]: https://github.com/issues?q=user%3ALibraryCarpentry\n[swc-issues]: https://github.com/issues?q=user%3Aswcarpentry\n[swc-lessons]: https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/\n[swc-site]: https://software-carpentry.org/\n[lc-site]: https://librarycarpentry.org/\n[template-doc]: https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/\n"
