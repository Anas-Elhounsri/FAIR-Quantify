        "value": "# Contributing to *PoreSpy*\n\nPoreSpy is a collection of image analysis functions that we use regularly in our research.  We hope other researchers will also find them useful, and ultimately hope users will contribute their own functions to the package to help make it even more useful.  This guide is intended to make it as easy as possible to get involved.\n\nBefore you start you'll need to set up a free GitHub account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions] to get started.\n\n## Ways to Contribute\n\n### Open a New Issue\n\nWe use Github to track [issues][link_issues].  Issues can take the form of:\n\n(a) bug reports such as a function producing an error or odd result in some circumstances.\n\n(b) feature requests such a suggesting a new function be added to the package, presumably based on some literature report that describes it, or enhancements to an existing function.\n\n(c) general usage questions where the documentation is not clear and you need help getting a function to work as desired.  This is actually a bug report in disguise since it means there is a problem with the documentation.\n\n### Addressing Open Issues\n\nHelp fixing open [issues][link_issues] is always welcome; however, the learning curve for submitting new code to any repo on Github is a bit intimidating.  The process is as follows:\n\na) [Fork][link_fork] PoreSpy to your own Github account. This lets you work on the code since you are the owner of that forked copy.\n\nb) Pull the code to your local machine using some Git client. We suggest [GitKraken][link_gitkraken]. For help using the Git version control system, see [these resources][link_using_git].\n\nc) Create a new branch, with a useful name like \"fix_issues_011\" or \"add_awesome_filter\", then checkout that branch.\n\nd) Edit the code as desired, either fixing or adding something.  You'll need to know Python and the various packages in the [Scipy][link_scipy] stack for this part.\n\ne) Push the changes back to Github, to your own repo.\n\nf) Navigate to the [pull requests area][link_pull_requests] on the PoreSpy repo, then click the \"new pull request\" button.  As the name suggests, you are [requesting us to pull][link_pullrequest] your code in to our repo.  You'll want to select the correct branch on your repo (e.g. \"add_awesome_filter\") and the \"dev\" branch on PoreSpy.\n\ng) This will trigger several things on our repo, including most importantly a conversation between you and the PoreSpy team about your code.  After any fine-tuning is done, we will merge your code into PoreSpy, and your contribution will be immortalized in PoreSpy.\n\n### Adding Examples\n\nWe also have a set of examples included in the [PoreSpy source code][link_examples], all done in Jupyter notebooks.  This is also an excellent place to contribute, by showing users how to build a \"pipeline\" of functions to accomplish certain tasks, or perhaps to reproduce some results in a published paper.  The fork and pull request workflow mentioned above still applies; however, if you wish to contribute a Notebook without all the hassle, you can just email the file to one of the PoreSpy developers and we can add it to the repo for you.\n\n\n\n[link_github]: https://github.com/\n[link_issues]: https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy/issues\n[link_gitkraken]: https://www.gitkraken.com/\n[link_pull_requests]: https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy/pulls\n[link_fork]: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\n[link_signupinstructions]: https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account\n[link_pullrequest]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/\n\n[link_using_git]: http://try.github.io/\n[link_examples]: https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy/tree/master/examples\n[link_scipy]: https://www.scipy.org/\n"

        "value": "**PoreSpy** is a collection of image analysis tools used to extract\ninformation from 3D images of porous materials (typically obtained from\nX-ray tomography). There are many packages that offer generalized image\nanalysis tools (i.e **Skimage** and **Scipy.NDimage** in the Python environment,\n**ImageJ**, **MatLab**'s Image Processing Toolbox), but they all require building\nup complex scripts or macros to accomplish tasks of specific use to\nporous media. The aim of **PoreSpy** is to provide a set of pre-written\ntools for all the common porous media measurements.  For instance, it's possible to perform a mercury intrusion simulation with a single function call (e.g. ``porespy.filters.porosimetry``). \n**PoreSpy** relies heavily on\n[scipy.ndimage](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html)\nand [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) also known as **skimage**.\nThe former contains an assortment of general image analysis tools such\nas image morphology filters, while the latter offers more complex but\nstill general functions such as watershed segmentation. **PoreSpy** does not\nduplicate any of these general functions so you will also have to\ninstall and learn how to use them to get the most from **PoreSpy**. The\nfunctions in PoreSpy are generally built up using several of the general functions offered by **skimage** and **scipy**. There are a few\nfunctions in **PoreSpy** that are implemented natively, but only when\nnecessary.\n \n"

This function allows the removal of all features small than a threshold size.\r\n- Added ``hold_peaks`` function: This function finds the highest greyscale value along in each slice along a given axis.\r\n- Added the ``prune_branches`` function.  Given an image skeleton, this removes all dangling branches.\r\n\r\n### Improved generators\r\n- Loosened tolerance for polydisperse generator test\r\n- Switched default solver in sphere generator to bisection method\r\n- Enhanced cylinders function to accept length argument\r\n\r\n### Minor changes\r\n- Changed ``trim_disconnected_blobs`` to make a copy of input image\r\n- Allowed get_border to optionally return indices as well as mask\r\n- Cleaned many docstrings throughout package (need to install a spell checker on IDE!)\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udc1b Bugfixes\r\n- Fixed bug in snow_extraction that resulted in some negative throat lengths\r\n- Fixed bug in ``trim_disconnected_blobs``.

We've been working on this package for more than a year, adding new functions, fine tuning the old functions, and generally optimizing the organization of things.  During this period, things have been breaking and changing, so we are happy to say that it is finally stable and ready for all to use.  \r\n\r\n- For information about what's in the package, refer to the [readme on Github](https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy/blob/dev/README.rst).  \r\n\r\n- For a gallery of examples showing how to use the package for various porous media related tasks, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy/tree/dev/examples) containing Jupyter notebooks.  \r\n\r\n- Any questions about using the package, bug reports, feature requests, and suggestions, should be directed to the [Github Issues page](https://github.com/PMEAL/porespy/issues).  \r\n\r\n- Finally, we plan to submit a pseudo-paper to the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) so that users may reference the software in any publications that relies on it.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the members of the Porous Materials Engineering and Analysis Lab in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Waterloo for their hard work on this:\r\n\r\n@TomTranter \r\n@mdrkok \r\n@ma-sadeghi \r\n@Zohaib-Atiq \r\n@magnaou \r\n@Ni2M \r\n@jgostick \r\n",

Obviously still lots of work to do and features to add, but at this point it can do the following:\r\n- Generate images of spheres and blobs with a specified porosity for testing.  Opening actual images requires the _imageio_ package, which is a new effort to open ALL image formats as Numpy arrays, including the recent addition of 3D tiffs.  \r\n- Perform several of the image analysis techniques reported by Torquato in his book Random Heterogeneous Materials, including: Chord Length Distribution, Two-Point Correlation Function, Pore Size Distribution Function.\r\n- Morphological Image Opening to simulate porosimetry curves\r\n\r\nIt is available on PyPI using `pip install porespy -v`  The -v is required since it's tagged as an alpha version so pip doesn't let you install unless you ask explicitly.  \r\n",
