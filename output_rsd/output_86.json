Excellent! \n\nReporting Issues\n----------------\n\nWhen opening an issue to report a problem, please try and provide a minimal\ncode example that reproduces the issue, and also include details of the\noperating system, compiler, and the Python, Numpy, and AMUSE versions you are using.\n\nContributing code\n-----------------\n\nMost contributions to AMUSE are done via pull requests from GitHub users'\nforks of the [amuse repository](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse).\n\nOnce you open a pull request (which should be opened against the ``master``\nbranch, not against any of the other branches), please make sure that you\ninclude the following:\n\n- **Code**: the code you are adding\n\n- **Tests**: these are usually tests to ensure that code that previously\n  failed now works (regression tests) or tests that cover as much as possible\n  of the new functionality to make sure it doesn't break in future, and also\n  returns consistent results on all platforms (since we run these tests on many\n  platforms/configurations). \n\n\nChecklist for Contributed Code\n------------------------------\n\nA pull request for a new feature will be reviewed to see if it meets the\nfollowing requirements.  For any pull request, an AMUSE maintainer can\nhelp to make sure that the pull request meets the requirements for inclusion\nin the package.\n\n**Scientific Quality**\n(when applicable)\n  * Is the submission relevant to AMUSE?\n  * Are references included to the origin paper for the simulation code?\n  * Does the code perform as expected?\n  * Has the code been tested against previously existing codes in the same domain?\n\n**Code Quality**\n  * Is the code compatible with Python >=3.7?\n  * Are there dependencies other than AMUSE, MPI, the Python Standard\n    Library, and NumPy?\n  * For compatibility reasons we prefer code that also works on older \n    versions of Numpy, matplotlib etc.\n  * Are additional dependencies handled appropiately? If possible, factor out \n    additional dependencies or make them optional.\n  * Does the code follow the AMUSE Style Guide (http://www.amusecode.org/doc/reference/style_guide.html)?\n\n**Testing**\n  * Are the inputs to the functions sufficiently tested?\n  * Are there tests for any exceptions raised?\n  * Are there tests for the expected performance?\n  * Are the sources for the tests documented?\n  * Does python setup.py test run without failures?\n\n**Documentation**\n  * Is there any information needed to be added to the docs to describe the code?\n\n**License**\n  * Does the code require a specific license other than the AMUSE license?\n  * Are there any conflicts with this code and AMUSE?\n\n**AMUSE requirements**\n  * Can you checkout the pull request and repeat the examples and tests?\n"

You can import each community code as `from amuse.community.{codename}.interface import {Codename}`, where {Codename} is now always available in Titlecase. The interface name is always available under the same name as the module. This is in addition to previous names, which will continue to exist and are not being deprecated. E.g.: ph4, BHTree and SimpleX are now also available as Ph4, Bhtree and Simplex, respectively.\r\n- The behaviour of code parameters has changed: setting non-existing parameters now generates an exception. Scripts that relied on the previous behaviour (ignoring parameters that are unknown to the code) should be changed to handle the excpetion.\r\n- new unit kyr (=1000 yr)\r\n- updates to the documentation/tutorial\r\n- all codes with c++ bindings MPI have them replaced \r\n- updates on Seba code\r\n- various fixes to codes\r\n- various python 3 fixes\r\n",
