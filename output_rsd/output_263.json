        "value": "DTBase is a software package that developers can fork to develop their own digital twins with minimal effort. Digital twins mean quite different things to different people, and thus we should clarify. DTBase has\n* A relational database, for holding both observational data (from e.g. sensors) and computational data (from models).\n* A web server that wraps the database in an HTTP API. A user should never directly interact with the database, but rather through the API.\n* A frontend web server, that provides a barebones graphical web user interface.\n* An infrastructure-as-code configuration for deploying these resources on Azure.\n* Tools for implementing your own \"services\", as DTBase calls them: Snippets of code that run periodically or on demand and interact with the backend API, such as data ingress functions or forecasting models.\n* A few example services:\n    * One to ingress weather data from OpenWeatherMap\n    * Ones for running the ARIMA and HODMD time series forecasting models\n* Basic access control (user accounts and logins).\n* Backend API endpoints, and for some of these frontend pages for easier interaction, for adding/editing/deleting\n    * sensors, and inserting and retrieving data associated with sensors.\n    * locations, and associating sensors with locations.\n    * models, and inserting and retrieving data outputted by models. By this we mean simply \"registering\" a model with DTBase, not adding the code to actually run the model.\n    * users. Separating users with different rights (e.g. admins) is currently unimplemented.\n    * services. These are URLs that one can call to trigger a snippet of code to run, which may interact with the backend API. For instance ingress functions or models. \nSome things DTBase does not, currently, have:\n* Anything related to physical 3D structure of the objects that it is twinning. We have a very basic system for tracking locations in the twin, and for instance assigning sensors to locations, but this remains underdeveloped.\n* Comprehensive visualisation tools. The frontend has basic time series plotting capabilities, but that's it.\n* Sophisticated model orchestration. The services infrastructure can be used to store parameters for models and run them on demand, but the rest remains in development.\n* Anything for using the digital twin to control the real asset.\n \n"

For instance, the frontend doesn't offer any functionality that the backend API doesn't have, so you can choose to only use the backend, and develop your own frontend from scratch. \nWe have designed the codebase so that as many of DTBase's features as possible can be deployed either locally or on Azure.
