You can contribute by forking this repository and creating a pull request.\n\nFormatting\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCode is easier to read if it formatted in a nice way. To format your code you can use :code:`clang-format` with the :code:`.clang_format` style file. \nTo do this run \n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    \n    clang-format --style=file:./clang_format YOUR_FILE\n\n\nWe also created a script that automatically formats any file that you commit using :code:`git commit`. To activate this script you have to let git know where it is located. You can do this by running:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n    git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/\n\n"

It is suitable for simulations with live visualization as well as batch simulations on clusters. \nTST 2.0 provides many recent extensions to the CPM, including \n* Efficient edgelist algorithm\n* Infinite number of PDE layers (forward Euler)\n* A reacion diffusion solver on the CPU and on CUDA\n* Interaction of CPM cells and PDE (secretion, absorption)\n* Chemotaxis\n* Length and connectivity constraints\n* Act-CPM model (Niculescu et al., PLOS Comput Biol 2015)\n* Discrete fibrous extracellular matrix (molecular dynamics) \n* Differential adhesion driven cell sorting (Glazier and Graner, 1993)\n* Cell elongation dependent vasculogenesis (blood vessel growth) (Merks et al., 2006) \n* Contact-inhibition dependent vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (Merks and Glazier, 2005; Merks and Glazier, 2006; Merks et al, PLoS Comput Biol 2008)\n* Hybrid cellular Potts and bead-spring modeling of cells in fibrous extracellular matrix (Tsingos and Bakker et al, Biophys J. 2023) \n\nand visualization of: \n* Cells, according to cell type or anything you wish\n* Chemical fields, using color ramps and contour lines (level sets)\n \n"

You will need to specifically select the command line tools in the installer.\n\nTo install the dependencies, we recommend installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Once you have that installed, you can install QT5, libpng and zlib using (see note on Qt below)\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    brew install qt@5 libpng zlib\n\nYou may have to edit `src/Tissue-Simulation-Toolkit.pri` for qmake to be able to find them. \n\nNote on Qt: If you have an existing Qt installation (e.g. the open source installation through qt.io)  do not install Qt again through homebrew. Instead, ensure that qmake is in the path or edit the Makefile such that the full path for qmake is given. \n\nNext, you can get the source by cloning the repository from GitHub.
