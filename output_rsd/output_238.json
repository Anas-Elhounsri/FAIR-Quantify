        "description": "# Cerulean\r\n\r\nCerulean is a Python 3 library for talking to HPC clusters and supercomputers. It lets you copy files between local and SFTP filesystems using a ``pathlib``-like API, it lets you start processes locally and remotely via SSH, and it lets you submit jobs to schedulers such as Slurm and Torque/PBS. Cerulean also supports WebDAV.\r\n                                                                                \r\n## Documentation and Help\r\n\r\nCerulean can be installed as usual using pip:\r\n\r\n`pip install cerulean`\r\n\r\nInstructions on how to use Cerulean can be found in [the Cerulean documentation](https://cerulean.readthedocs.io).\r\n\r\n# Release 0.3.7\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n* Symlink resolving issue\r\n* Tooling improvements",
