Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.\n- **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.\n- **Do not harass people**. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous\u2014not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.\n- **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participant\u2019s personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (\"doxing\") is a form of harassment.\n- **Be considerate of others\u2019 participation**. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.\n- **Don\u2019t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.\n- As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes**.\n\nAll interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.\nSee [this explanation of the four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) - no feigning surprise, no well-actually's, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.\n\n### 2.2 Unacceptable Behaviour\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour by Data Safe Haven community members at any project event or platform include:\n\n- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group\n- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation\n- violent threats or language directed against another person\n- the display of sexual or violent images\n- unwelcome sexual attention\n- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact\n- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications\n- insults or put downs\n- sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes\n- excessive swearing\n- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm\n- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop\n- publication of private communication without consent\n\n### 2.3 Consequences of Unacceptable Behaviour\n\nParticipants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.\nThis applies to all Data Safe Haven community events and platforms, either online or in-person.\nIf a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of the core development team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or impose any other appropriate sanctions (see the [enforcement manual](#4-enforcement-manual) for details).\n\n### 2.4 Feedback\n\nThis Code of Conduct is not intended as a static set of rules by which everyone must abide.\nRather, you are invited to make suggestions for updates or clarifications by making a pull request to this document on GitHub.\n\n## 3 Incident Reporting Guidelines\n\n### 3.1 Contact points\n\nIf you feel able to, please contact one of the [Code of Conduct Committee](#41-the-code-of-conduct-committee) members by email.\n\n### 3.2 Alternate contact points\n\nIf you would like to contact someone outside of the core development team, please contact the **external project contact** on the [Code of Conduct Committee](#41-the-code-of-conduct-committee).\n\n### 3.3 What to do if someone is in physical danger\n\nIf you believe someone is in physical danger, please contact the appropriate emergency responders.\n\n### 3.4 Code of Conduct Enforcement\n\nA detailed enforcement policy is available in the Enforcement Manual below.\n\n## 4 Enforcement Manual\n\nThis is the enforcement manual followed by the Data Safe Haven project research team.\nIt's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair.\nEnforcement of the Code of Conduct should be respectful and not include any harassing behaviours.\n\n### 4.1 The Code of Conduct Committee\n\nThe Code of Conduct committee is:\n\n- [Martin O'Reilly](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/martin-oreilly) - [moreilly@turing.ac.uk](mailto:moreilly@turing.ac.uk) (**CoC lead**)\n- [Kirstie Whitaker](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kirstie-whitaker) - [kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk](mailto:kwhitaker@turing.ac.uk) (_currently on maternity leave_)\n- [Arielle Bennett](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/programme-management/arielle-bennett) - [abennett@turing.ac.uk](mailto:abennett@turing.ac.uk) (_replacement contact until Kirstie returns_)\n- [Harriet McCann](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/business-team/harriet-mccann) - [hmccann@turing.ac.uk](mailto:hmccann@turing.ac.uk) (_external project contact_)\n\nAs the community grows, we will seek to build a larger committee including members outside of the core development team.\n\n### 4.2 Urgent Situations: Acting Unilaterally\n\nIf the incident involves physical danger, or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any member of the community may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of any community member.\nThis can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the Data Safe Haven team.\n\nIf the act is ongoing, any community member may act immediately, before reaching consensus, to diffuse the situation.\nIn ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available in this enforcement manual, including bans and blocks online, or removal from a physical space.\n\nIn situations where an individual community member acts unilaterally, they must inform [the Code of Conduct Committee](#41-the-code-of-conduct-committee) as soon as possible, and report their actions for review within 24 hours.\n\n### 4.3 Less-Urgent Situations\n\nUpon receiving a report of an incident, the CoC committee will review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:\n\n- whether this is an ongoing situation\n- whether there is a threat to anyone's physical safety\n- what happened\n- whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation\n- who, if anyone, was the bad actor\n\nThis information will be collected either in person or in writing.\nThe CoC committee will provide a written summary of the information surrounding the incident.\nAll participants will be anonymised in the summary report, referred to as \"Community Member 1\", \"Community Member 2\", or \"Research Team Member 1\".\nThe \"de-anonymising key\" will be kept in a separate file and only accessed to link repeated reports against the same person over time.\n\nThe CoC committee will aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week.\nIn the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, a member of the CoC committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.\n\n### 4.4 Resolutions\n\nThe CoC committee will seek to agree on a resolution by consensus of all members investigating the report in question.\nIf the committee cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the CoC lead, will break the tie.\nIf the CoC lead is unable to take part in the discussion due to a conflict of interest, the external project contact will take their place.\n\nPossible responses may include:\n\n- A mediated conversation or agreement between the impacted community members.\n- A request for a verbal or written apology, public or private, from a community member.\n- A public announcement clarifying community responsibilities under the Code of Conduct.\n- Nothing, if the issue reported is not a violation or outside of the scope of this Code of Conduct.\n- A private in-person conversation between a member of the research team and the individual(s) involved.\n  In this case, the person who has the conversation will provide a written summary for record keeping.\n- A private written reprimand from a member of the research team to the individual(s) involved.\n  In this case, the research team member will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing [the Code of Conduct Committee](#41-the-code-of-conduct-committee) for record keeping.\n- A public announcement of an incident, ideally in the same venue that the violation occurred (such as on the listserv for a listserv violation; and GitHub for a GitHub violation).\n  The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.\n- An imposed \"time out\" from online spaces.\n  [The Code of Conduct Committee](#41-the-code-of-conduct-committee) will communicate this \"time out\" to the individual(s) involved.\n- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Data Safe Haven project spaces (like on GitHub, Slack, online calls or in-person events).\n  The research team will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to a Code of Conduct safety team as it is built, or otherwise maintained.\n  If a member of the community is removed from an event they will not be reimbursed for any part of the event that they miss.\n\nOnce a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, a member of the CoC committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution.\nThe CoC committee member will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.\nHowever, the CoC committee is not required to act on this feedback.\n\n### 4.5 Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the event of any conflict of interest such that one or more members of the [the Code of Conduct Committee](#41-the-code-of-conduct-committee) are unable to evaluate or enforce the reported violation, they will recuse themselves from any discussion of the issue in question.\n\n## 5

        "value": "# Contributing to the Turing Data Safe Haven project\n\n**Welcome to the Turing Data Safe Haven project repository!**\n\nThank you for being here and contributing to the project.\nIt can truly only succeed with a interdisciplinary team working together.\n\nThe point of these contributing guidelines are to help you participate as easily as possible.\nIf you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by [opening an issue](#project-management-through-issues).\n\n## A DevOps development philosophy\n\nFor the Data Safe Haven project, we follow a DevOps development philosophy.\nThis means different things to different people, but the definition that we're using is [best summed up here](https://www.guru99.com/agile-vs-devops.html).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n   <img src=\"docs/source/contributing/devops_gap.png\" width=\"80%\" title=\"Taken from https://www.guru99.com/agile-vs-devops.html\">\n</p>\n\nThis is a software development method which focuses on:\n\n- communication\n- integration\n- collaboration\n\nbetween the development team and the operations team to enable rapid deployment of products.\nThe most pertinent features of the DevOps methodology for this project are:\n\n- **focus**: operational readiness\n- **structure**: separate development and operations teams\n- **duration**: benchmarks around stable releases\n- **emphasis**: taking software which is ready for release and deploying it in a reliable and secure manner\n- **documentation**: documenting processes is a key part of the development cycle\n- **automation**: maximal automation is the primary goal\n- **quality**: full integration testing each time features are added\n\n## Project workflow\n\nAlthough we are not following an Agile workflow, we still think that the following features are important:\n\n- No work that is not **documented in an issue** on GitHub\n- All policy documents, guidelines, tutorials, code and its documentation to be **stored and maintained in this GitHub repository**\n- Issues to be triaged at regular **project meetings** with the next milestone release in mind\n\n### Project meetings\n\nThe goal of the project meetings is to **reflect** on how ongoing work is proceeding and to **plan** the next section of work.\nDuring the project meetings we'll start by working through the [issues list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/issues) and discussing any issues that are in progress.\nWe will consider whether we should start work on any issues from the backlog.\n\nNote that the project meeting is very explicitly **not** where the work gets done.\nIt is a review, reflection and an opportunity to set goals.\nDiscussions around particular tasks should be conducted **when the work is being carried out** not in the meeting.\n\n### Communications within the team and asking for help\n\nAs this team is distributed, not working full-time on this project and often working asynchronously, we do not have any form of daily meeting or stand-up.\nThe best way to work around this absence is to **commit to sharing updates as regularly as possible**.\nPlease see the section on [project management through issues](#project-management-through-issues) below on how to do this via GitHub.\n\n## Contributing through GitHub\n\nWe use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n   <img src=\"docs/source/contributing/gitflow.svg\" width=\"80%\" title=\"Taken from https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow\">\n</p>\n\nThis means that:\n\n- checking out the `latest` branch, will give you the latest tagged release\n- the `develop` branch, which is the default branch of the repository, contains the latest cutting-edge code that has not yet made it into a release\n- we prefer to use [merge commits](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/about-merge-methods-on-github) in order to avoid rewriting the git history\n\n### Issues as conversations\n\nIf you have an idea for a piece of work to complete, please **open an issue**.\n\nThe name `issue` comes from a concept of catching errors (bugs :bug:) in software, but for this project they are simply our **tasks**.\nIf an issue is growing to encompass more than one task, consider breaking it into multiple issues.\n\nYou can think of the issues as **conversations** about a particular topic.\n`GitHub`'s tagline is **social coding** and the issues are inspired by social media conversations.\nAlternatively (and this is encouraged) you can use the issue to keep track of where you're up to with the task and add information about next steps and barriers.\n\n### Discussions vs Issues\n\n**Discussions** are the best place for informal talk about the project\nYou should feel welcome to create a discussion on any relevant topic, without the formality of an issue.\nGood examples of discussions are:\n\n- Any questions\n- Possible bugs (does anyone else have this problem?)\n- Looking for collaborators\n- Community support\n\n**Issues** are best used for tracking development work.\nThis is because issues integrate well with GitHub development tools like projects, pull requests, assignments and so on.\nEach issue should ideally represent a well-defined, self-contained piece of work suitable to become a single pull request.\nGood examples of issues are\n\n- Bug reports with technical detail\n- Feature requests\n- Specific ideas for changes\n\nWhen opening an issue, pick a suitable template (if possible) to make the process easier.\n\n### Project management through issues\n\nPlease regularly check out the agreed upon tasks at the [issues list](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/issues).\nIssues should be tagged with an appropriate [label](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/issues/labels) by a member of the development team.\nEach issue should be assigned to an appropriate [milestone](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven/milestones).\n\nIf you have been assigned an issue, please be ready to explain in the [project meeting](#project-meetings) what your progress has been.\nIn a perfect world you'll have completed the task, documented everything you need to and we'll be able to **close** the issue (to mark it as complete).\n\n## Contributing your changes\n\n### Making a change with a pull request\n\nTo contribute to the codebase you'll need to:\n\n- [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to your own GitHub profile\n- make your changes [on a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)\n- submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)\n\n### Making a change to the documentation\n\nThe docs, including for older releases, are available [here](https://data-safe-haven.readthedocs.io).\nYou should follow the same instructions as above to [make a change with a pull request](#making-a-change-with-a-pull-request) when editing the documentation.\n\nThe documentation is built from Markdown files using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and [MyST parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/).\nTo preview your changes, you can build the docs locally with `hatch`:\n\n```console\n> hatch run docs:build\n```\n\n- The generated documents will be placed under `build/html/`.\n- To view the documents open `build/html/index.html` in your browser, for example:\n\n```console\n> firefox build/html/index.html\n```\n\n## Preparing a new release\n\nReleases are made by branching from `develop` into a branch called `release-<version name>`\n\n- deployment is tested from this release and any necessary integration changes are made on this branch\n- the branch is then merged into `latest` (which is tagged) as the next release **and** into `develop` so that any fixes are included there\n\nThe release can then be published to PyPI:\n\n- Build the tarball and wheel\n\n```console\n> hatch run build\n```\n\n- Upload to PyPI, providing your API token at the prompt\n\n```console\n> hatch run publish --user __token__\n```\n\n## Who's involved in the project\n\nTake a look at the full list of contributors on our [README](README.md).\n\n### Adding new contributors\n\nWe use @all-contributors to maintain the contributor list on the README, however we do not use the GitHub bot.\n\nYou should follow the same instructions as above to [make a change with a pull request](#making-a-change-with-a-pull-request) when adding a new contributor.\n\nTo add new contributor to the README table, see the [all-contributors CLI documentation](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/cli/overview) and use the CLI to add the new contributor, then make a pull request with your changes.\n\n## Get in touch\n\nYou can get in touch with the development team at safehavendevs@turing.ac.uk.\n\n**Thank you!**\n\nYou're awesome! :wave::smiley:\n\n_Based on contributing guidelines from the [BIDS Starter
