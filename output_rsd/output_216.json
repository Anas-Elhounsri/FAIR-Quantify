Feel\nfree to fill gaps or fix mistakes, and please email improvements\nto <tz@iana.org> for use in the future.  In your email, please give\nreliable sources that reviewers can check.\n\n## Contributing technical changes\n\nTo email small changes, please run a POSIX shell command like\n'diff -u old/europe new/europe >myfix.patch', and attach\n'myfix.patch' to the email.\n\nFor more-elaborate or possibly controversial changes,\nsuch as renaming, adding or removing zones, please read\n\"Theory and pragmatics of the tz code and data\"\n<https://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/theory.html>.\nIt is also good to browse the mailing list archives\n<https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/> for examples of patches that tend\nto work well.  Additions to data should contain commentary citing\nreliable sources as justification.  Citations should use \"https:\" URLs\nif available.\n\nFor changes that fix sensitive security-related bugs, please see the\ndistribution's 'SECURITY' file.\n\nPlease submit changes against either the latest release\n<https://www.iana.org/time-zones> or the main branch of the development\nrepository.  The latter is preferred.\n\n## Sample Git workflow for developing contributions\n\nIf you use Git the following workflow may be helpful:\n\n  * Copy the development repository.\n\n        git clone https://github.com/eggert/tz.git\n        cd tz\n\n  * Get current with the main branch.\n\n        git checkout main\n        git pull\n\n  * Switch to a new branch for the changes.  Choose a different\n    branch name for each change set.\n\n        git checkout -b mybranch\n\n  * Sleuth by using 'git blame'.  For example, when fixing data for\n    Africa/Sao_Tome, if the command 'git blame africa' outputs a line\n    '2951fa3b (Paul Eggert 2018-01-08 09:03:13 -0800 1068) Zone\n    Africa/Sao_Tome 0:26:56 - LMT 1884', commit 2951fa3b should\n    provide some justification for the 'Zone Africa/Sao_Tome' line.\n\n  * Edit source files.  Include commentary that justifies the\n    changes by citing reliable sources.\n\n  * Debug the changes, e.g.:\n\n        make check\n        make install\n        ./zdump -v America/Los_Angeles\n\n  * For each separable change, commit it in the new branch, e.g.:\n\n        git add northamerica\n        git commit\n\n    See recent 'git log' output for the commit-message style.\n\n  * Create patch files 0001-..., 0002-..., ...\n\n        git format-patch main\n\n  * After reviewing the patch files, send the patches to <tz@iana.org>\n    for others to review.\n\n        git send-email main\n\n    For an archived example of such an email, see\n    \"[PROPOSED] Fix off-by-1 error for Jamaica and T&C before 1913\"\n    <https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2018-February/026122.html>.\n\n  * Start anew by getting current with the main branch again\n    (the second step above).\n\n-----\n\nThis file is in the public domain.\n"

Installing and restoring packages is much faster, as renv can find and re-use previously installed packages from the cache.\n\n2.  Projects take up less disk space, because each project doesn't need to contain it's own copy of every package.\n\nWhen installing a package, renv installs into the global cache and then adds a symlink[^1] to that directory in the project library.\nThat way each renv project remains isolated from other projects on your system, but they can still re-use the same installed packages.\n\n[^1]: Or junction points, on Windows.\n    Junction points are unfortunately not supported on Windows network shares; see [Hard links and junctions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/hard-links-and-junctions) for more details.\n\nThe process by which packages enter the cache is roughly as follows:\n\n1.  Package installation is requested via e.g. `install.packages()`, or `renv::install()`, or as part of `renv::restore()`.\n\n2.  If renv is able to find the requested version of the package in the cache, then that package is linked into the project library, and installation is complete.\n\n3.  Otherwise, the package is downloaded and installed into the project library.\n\n4.  After installation of the package has successfully completed, the package is then copied into the global package cache, and then symlinked into the project library.\n\nIn some cases, renv will be unable to directly link from the global package cache to your project library, e.g. if the package cache and your project library live on different disk volumes.\nIn such a case, renv will instead copy the package from the cache into the project library.\nThis is much slower, so is worth avoiding.\n\n### Cache location\n\nYou can find the location of the current cache with `renv::paths$cache()`.\nBy default, it will be in one of the following folders:\n\n-   Linux: `~/.local/share/renv`\n-   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/renv`\n-   Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/renv`\n\nIf you'd like to share the package cache across multiple users, you can do so by setting the `RENV_PATHS_CACHE` environment variable to a shared path.\nThis variable should be set in an R startup file to make it apply to all R sessions.\nWhile you can set it in a project-local `.Renviron`, or the user-level `~/.Renviron`, we generally recommend using the R installation's site-wide `Renviron.site` if you'd like to ensure the same cache path is visible to all users of R on a system.\n\nYou may also want to set `RENV_PATHS_CACHE` so that the global package cache can be stored on the same volume as the projects you normally work on.\nThis is especially important when working projects stored on a networked filesystem.\n\n### Multiple caches\n\nIt is also possible to configure renv to use multiple cache locations.\nFor example, you might want to make both a user-local package cache, as well as a global administrator-managed cache, visible within an renv project.\nTo do so, you can specify the paths to the cache separated with a `;` (or `:` on Unix if preferred).\nFor example:\n\n```         \nRENV_PATHS_CACHE=/path/to/local/cache;/path/to/global/cache\n```\n\nIn such a case, renv will iterate over the cache locations in order when trying to find a package, and newly-installed packages will enter the first writable cache path listed in `RENV_PATHS_CACHE`.\n\n### Shared cache locations\n\nWhen the renv cache is enabled, if that cache is shared and visible to multiple users, then each of those users will have an opportunity to install packages into the renv cache.\nHowever, some care must be taken to ensure that these packages can be used by different users in your environment:\n\n1.  Packages copied into the cache may have [Access-control Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list) (ACLs), which might prevent others from using packages that have been installed into the cache.\n    If this is the case, it's important that ACLs be set (or updated) on cache entries so that the cache is accessible to each user requiring access.\n    When deploying renv in an enterprise environment, the system administrator should take care to ensure ACLs (if any) allow users access to packages within the renv cache.\n\n2.  By default, packages copied into the cache will remain \"owned\" by the user that requested installation of that package.\n    If you'd like renv to instead re-assign ownership of the cached package to a separate user account, you can set the `RENV_CACHE_USER` environment variable.\n    When set, renv will attempt to run `chown -R <package> <user>` to update cache ownership after the package has been copied into the cache.\n\n### Caveats\n\nWhile we recommend enabling the cache by default, if you're having trouble with it, you can disable it by setting the project setting `renv::settings$use.cache(FALSE)`.\nDoing this will ensure that packages are then installed into your project library directly, without attempting to link and use packages from the renv cache.\n\nIf you find a problematic package has entered the cache (for example, an installed package has become corrupted), that package can be removed with the `renv::purge()` function.\nSee the `?purge` documentation for caveats and things to be aware of when removing packages from the cache.\n\nYou can also force a package to be re-installed and re-cached with the following functions:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\n# restore packages from the lockfile, bypassing the cache\nrenv::restore(rebuild = TRUE)\n\n# re-install a package\nrenv::install(\"<package>\", rebuild = TRUE)\n\n# rebuild all packages in the project\nrenv::rebuild()\n```\n\nSee each function's respective documentation for more details.\n\n## Building from source\n\nWhere possible, renv will install package binaries, but sometimes a binary is not available and you have to build from source.\nInstallation from source can be challenging for a few reasons:\n\n1.  Your system will need to have a compatible compiler toolchain available.\n    In some cases, R packages may depend on C / C++ features that aren't available in an older system toolchain, especially in some older Linux enterprise environments.\n\n2.  Your system will need requisite system libraries, as many R packages contain compiled C / C++ code that depend on and link to these packages.\n\n<!-- TODO: renv::equip() for Linux + macOS; use sysreqsdb -->\n\n### Configure flags\n\nMany `R` packages have a `configure` script that needs to be run to prepare the package for installation.\nArguments and environment variables can be passed through to those scripts in a manner similar to `install.packages()`.\nIn particular, the `R` options `configure.args` and `configure.vars` can be used to map package names to their appropriate configuration.\nFor example:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\n# installation of RNetCDF may require us to set include paths for netcdf\nconfigure.args = c(RNetCDF = \"--with-netcdf-include=/usr/include/udunits2\"))\noptions(configure.args = configure.args)\nrenv::install(\"RNetCDF\")\n```\n\nThis could also be specified as, for example,\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\noptions(\n  configure.args.RNetCDF = \"--with-netcdf-include=/usr/include/udunits2\"\n)\nrenv::install(\"RNetCDF\")\n```\n\n### Install flags\n\nSimilarly, additional flags that should be passed to `R CMD INSTALL` can be set via the `install.opts` `R` option:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\n# installation of R packages using the Windows Subsystem for Linux\n# may require the `--no-lock` flag to be set during install\noptions(install.opts = \"--no-lock\")\nrenv::install(\"xml2\")\n\n# alternatively, you can set such options for specific packages with e.g.\noptions(install.opts = list(xml2 = \"--no-lock\"))\nrenv::install(\"xml2\")\n```\n\n### Vignettes\n\nrenv does not build vignettes when installing a package from source.\nThis is because vignettes often require suggested packages, and installing all suggested packages (particularly from source) can be arduous.\n\nIf you want to distribute vignettes for your own packages, we suggest creating your own repository of binaries, either with [R Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search/) (for publicly hosted packages on GitHub), with [Posit Package Manager](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/package-manager/), or with [drat](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/).\n\n## Downloads\n\nBy default, renv uses [curl](https://curl.se/) for file downloads when available.\nThis allows renv to support a number of download features across multiple versions of R, including:\n\n-   Custom headers (used especially for authentication),\n-   Connection timeouts,\n-   Download retries on transient errors.\n\nIf `curl` is not available on your machine, it is highly recommended that you install it.\nNewer versions of Windows 10 come with a bundled version of `curl.exe`; other users on Windows can use `renv::equip()` to download and install a recent copy of `curl`.\nNewer versions of macOS come with a bundled version of `curl` that is adequate for usage with renv, and most Linux package managers have a modern version of `curl` available in their package repositories.\nYou can also configure which `curl` executable is used by setting the `RENV_CURL_EXECUTABLE` environment variable, if necessary.\n\n`curl` downloads can be configured through renv's configuration settings -- see `?renv::config` for more details.\n\n### Alternative downloaders\n\nIf you've already configured R's downloader and would like to bypass renv's attempts to use `curl`, you can use the R option `renv.download.override`.\nFor example, executing:\n\n``` r\noptions(renv.download.override = utils::download.file)\n```\n\nwould instruct renv to use R's own download machinery when attempting to download files from the internet (respecting the R options `download.file.method` and `download.file.extra` as appropriate).\nAdvanced users can also provide their own download function, provided its signature matches that of `utils::download.file()`.\n\nYou can also instruct renv to use a different download method by setting the `RENV_DOWNLOAD_METHOD` environment variable.\nFor example:\n\n```         \n# use Windows' internal download machinery\nSys.setenv(RENV_DOWNLOAD_METHOD = \"wininet\")\n\n# use R's bundled libcurl implementation\nSys.setenv(RENV_DOWNLOAD_METHOD = \"libcurl\")\n```\n\nIf you find that downloads work outside of renv projects, but not within renv projects, you may need to tell renv to use the same download file method that R has been configured to use.\nYou can check which download method R is currently configured to use with:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ngetOption(\"download.file.method\")\n```\n\nAnd the downloader currently used by renv can be queried with:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nrenv:::renv_download_method()\n```\n\nYou can force renv to use the same download method as R by setting:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nSys.setenv(RENV_DOWNLOAD_METHOD = getOption(\"download.file.method\"))\n```\n\nand, if necessary, you could also set this environment variable within e.g. your `~/.Renviron`, so that it is visible to all R sessions.\nSee `?Startup` for more details.\n\nNote that other features (e.g. authentication) may not be supported when using an alternative download file method -- you will have to configure the downloader yourself if that is required.\nSee `?download.file` for more details.\n\n### Proxies\n\nIf your downloads need to go through a proxy server, then there are a variety of approaches you can take to make this work:\n\n1.  Set the `http_proxy` and / or `https_proxy` environment variables.\n    These environment variables can contain the full URL to your proxy server, including a username + password if necessary.\n\n2.  You can use a `.curlrc` (`_curlrc` on Windows) to provide information about the proxy server to be used.\n    This file should be placed in your home folder (see `Sys.getenv(\"HOME\")`, or `Sys.getenv(\"R_USER\")` on Windows); alternatively, you can set the `CURL_HOME` environment variable to point to a custom 'home' folder to be used by `curl` when resolving the runtime configuration file.\n    On Windows, you can also place your `_curlrc` in the same directory where the `curl.exe` binary is located.\n\nSee the curl documentation on [proxies](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/proxies.html) and [config files](https://everything.curl.dev/cmdline/configfile.html) for more details.\n\nAs an [example](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/146), the following `_curlrc` works when using authentication with NTLM and SSPI on Windows:\n\n```         \n--proxy \"your.proxy.dns:port\"\n--proxy-ntlm\n--proxy-user \":\"\n--insecure\n```\n\nThe [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) R package also has a helper:\n\n```         \ncurl::ie_get_proxy_for_url()\n```\n\nwhich may be useful when attempting to discover this proxy address.\n\n### Authentication\n\nYour project may make use of packages which are available from remote sources requiring some form of authentication to access -- for example, a GitHub enterprise server.\nUsually, either a personal access token (PAT) or username + password combination is required for authentication.\nrenv is able to authenticate when downloading from such sources, using the same system as the [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package.\nIn particular, environment variables are used to record and transfer the required authentication information.\n\n| **Remote Source** | **Authentication**                      |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| GitHub            | `GITHUB_PAT`                            |\n| GitLab            | `GITLAB_PAT`                            |\n| Bitbucket         | `BITBUCKET_USER` + `BITBUCKET_PASSWORD` |\n| Git Remotes       | `GIT_PAT` / `GIT_USER` + `GIT_PASSWORD` |\n\nThese credentials can be stored in e.g. `.Renviron`, or can be set in your R session through other means as appropriate.\n\nIf you require custom authentication for different packages (for example, your project makes use of packages available on different GitHub enterprise servers), you can use the `renv.auth` R option to provide package-specific authentication settings.\n`renv.auth` can either be a a named list associating package names with environment variables, or a function accepting a package name + record, and returning a list of environment variables.\nFor example:\n\n``` r\n# define a function providing authentication\noptions(renv.auth = function(package, record) {\n  if (package == \"MyPackage\")\n    return(list(GITHUB_PAT = \"<pat>\"))\n})\n\n# use a named list directly\noptions(renv.auth = list(\n  MyPackage = list(GITHUB_PAT = \"<pat>\")\n))\n\n# alternatively, set package-specific option\n# as a list\noptions(renv.auth.MyPackage = list(GITHUB_PAT = \"<pat>\"))\n# as a function\noptions(renv.auth.MyPackage = function(record) {\n   list(GITHUB_PAT = \"<pat>\")\n})\n```\n\nFor packages installed from Git remotes, renv will attempt to use `git` from the command line to download and restore the associated package.\nHence, it is recommended that authentication is done through SSH keys when possible.\n\nAuthentication may be required when resolving a package from a remote specification.\nIf the package name cannot be inferred directly from the remote, it can be supplied with a prefix of the form `<package>=`.\nFor example, the igraph package on GitHub at <https://github.com/igraph/rigraph> could be installed with:\n\n```         \nrenv::install(\"igraph=igraph/rigraph\")\n```\n\n### Custom headers\n\nIf you want to set arbitrary headers when downloading files using renv, you can do so using the `renv.download.headers` R option.\nIt should be a function that accepts a URL, and returns a named character vector indicating the headers which should be supplied when accessing that URL.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a package repository hosted at `https://my/repository`, and the credentials required to access that repository are stored in the `AUTH_HEADER` environment variable.\nYou could define `renv.download.headers` like so:\n\n``` r\noptions(renv.download.headers = function(url) {\n  if (grepl(\"^https://my/repository\", url))\n    return(c(Authorization = Sys.getenv(\"AUTH_HEADER\")))\n})\n```\n\nWith the above, renv will set the `Authorization` header whenever it attempts to download files from the repository at URL `https://my/repository`.\n\n### Debugging\n\nIf having problems with downloads, you can get more debugging information (including raw requests and responses) by setting:\n\n```R\noptions(renv.download.trace = TRUE) \n```\n"
