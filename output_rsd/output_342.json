Users (or the applications\nthey use) submit workflows expressing their desired data processing operation,\nand the system will determine automatically whether the workflow can be\nexecuted, and if so how. \nMahiru's execution model is very flexible, and can support data downloads,\ncompute-to-data, software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, trusted\nthird parties, and distributed machine learning, and it will automatically\nassemble any combination of these required to fulfil a request. \nMahiru is a federated design, which means that participating parties can run a\nMahiru site on their own hardware, on their own premises and fully under their\nown control. Their policies will be stored in their own system, and enforced by\nit. Users may also allow their data to be copied to other sites, in which case\nthey will have to trust those sites to apply and enforce their policies on their\nbehalf. If desired, sites can be run in the cloud or at a trusted hosting\nprovider as well. \nPolicies govern where data can go and how it can be processed by the Mahiru\nsystem. This control may be held exclusively by the data owner, or it can be\ndelegated to someone else completely or partially, for instance by relying on an\nexternal auditor to audit software used to process the data. \nThe Mahiru design focuses on secure, federated data exchange and processing.\nBuying and selling access rights are outside of its scope, although the system\ncould be extended to incorporate this. \nMahiru is the\n`Akkadian word for market <https://www.assyrianlanguages.org/akkadian/dosearch.php?searchkey=2951&language=id>`_.\nAkkadian was spoken in ancient Mesopotamia, in particular in the city of\nBabylon, home of `King Hammurabi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi>`_\nwhose `Code of Hammurabi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi>`_ is\none of the oldest known written legal texts. During his reign in the 18th\ncentury BCE, Hammurabi made Babylon into a major city and a center of commerce,\nart and learning, and some one thousand years later,\n`Babylonian astronomy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy>`_ would\nform the beginning of the Western exact sciences. \nA thousand years is a long time to sustain a software project, but we hope\nMahiru can be a center of policy-driven data exchange and learning for a\nthousand weeks at least. \nIf you want to contribute to the development of SecConNet Proof of Concept,\nhave a look at the `contribution guidelines <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_. \nCopyright 2020,2021 Netherlands eScience Center and University of Amsterdam \nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at \nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License. \n"

        "description": "Mahiru Data Exchange - proof of concept\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nA proof of concept for a federated, policy-driven data exchange for the SecConNet project.\r\n\r\nMahiru is a design for a distributed data processing system which lets data and software owners share their data and software while keeping it under their control to any desired extent by defining policies. Users (or the applications they use) submit workflows expressing their desired data processing operation, and the system will determine automatically whether the workflow can be executed, and if so how.\r\n\r\nMahiru's execution model is very flexible, and can support data downloads, compute-to-data, software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, trusted third parties, and distributed machine learning, and it will automatically assemble any combination of these required to fulfil a request.\r\n\r\nMahiru is a federated design, which means that participating parties can run a Mahiru site on their own hardware, on their own premises and fully under their own control. Their policies will be stored in their own system, and enforced by it. Users may also allow their data to be copied to other sites, in which case they will have to trust those sites to apply and enforce their policies on their behalf. If desired, sites can be run in the cloud or at a trusted hosting provider as well.\r\n\r\nPolicies govern where data can go and how it can be processed by the Mahiru system. This control may be held exclusively by the data owner, or it can be delegated to someone else completely or partially, for instance by relying on an external auditor to audit software used to process the data.\r\n\r\nThe Mahiru design focuses on secure, federated data exchange and processing. Buying and selling access rights are outside of its scope, although the system could be extended to incorporate this.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial release of a proof-of-concept implementation. It does not implement all features, but serves to demonstrate a few key parts of the system.\r\n\r\nLegal\r\n-----\r\nCopyright 2020,2021 Netherlands eScience Center and University of Amsterdam\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
