Ensure your code passes all lint checks before submitting a pull request.\n\n### React Best Practices\n\n- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.\n- Use functional components with hooks for state management and side effects.\n- Place all components in the `components` directory, and use the naming convention `ComponentName.tsx` for component files.\n- For state management, prefer context and hooks; use state management libraries (like Redux) only if necessary for global state.\n\n### Node.js and Express Best Practices\n\n- Use async/await for asynchronous code for better readability and error handling.\n- Validate and sanitize input data to prevent security vulnerabilities.\n- Handle errors properly and send meaningful error responses to the client.\n\n### Testing (still in progress)\n\n- Write unit tests for all new code and changes to existing code. We use Jest as our testing framework.\n- Aim for a high test coverage to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.\n- Tests should be placed in a `__tests__` directory within the same directory as the tested code.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Document all public functions and components with JSDoc comments.\n- Update the README.md with any changes in the setup process or added functionalities.\n- If you introduce new features, include examples or update existing examples to reflect the change.\n- Update the [readthedocs](https://workflomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) documentation if your changes affect the user-facing documentation.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n- Provide a clear description of the problem and solution in your pull request.\n- Include screenshots or GIFs if your changes affect the UI.\n- Link to the related issue(s) in your pull request description.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you help ensure that Workflomics remains a high-quality, maintainable, and user-friendly platform. We appreciate your contributions and efforts to improve the project.\n"
