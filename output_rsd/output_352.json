        "value": "The binary convert-littler requires a Fortran namelist as argument, for example:\n```\nnetcdf2littler --namelist netcdf2littler.namelist\n```\nIf no argument is supplied, `netcdf2littler` tries to use the file `netcdf2littler.namelist` from the current working directory.\n\nThe input namelist provides information to the application on the variables in the NetCDF file, the timeframe for which observations need to be converted, as well as the variables. Below is an example input.namelist (which has just one variable):\n```\n&NETCDF2LITTLER\n  filename = 'test.nc'\n  outfile = 'results.txt'\n  variable_name = 'temperature', 'rltvh', 'pressure_station', 'winddir',\n  variable_mapping = 'temperature' 'humidity' 'pressure' 'direction'\n  devices = 1\n  dimensions = 1\n  startdate = 20140630\n  enddate = 20140802\n/\n```\nhere variable_name is the name of the variables in the NetCDF file, variable_mapping is a mapping to the name used in the application. Valid names to be used in the variable_mapping definition (and their meaning) are:\n```\ntemperature: temperature (degC or degK)\ndew_point: dew point temperature (degC or degK)\nhumidity: relative humidity (%)\npressure: pressure at measurement height (Pa)\nmslp: sea level pressure (Pa)\nwindspeed: windspeed (m/s)\ndirection: wind direction (deg)\nuwind: wind speed in U direction (m/s)\nvwind: wind speed in V direction (m/s)\n```\nDevices should be set equal to the number of devices in the netCDF file, i.e. this is equal to the number of observation stations.\n"
