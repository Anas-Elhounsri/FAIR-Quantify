        "value": "A default configuration file is installed in /etc/pyfrbcatdb/dbase.config. In this file the FRBCat database configuration can be defined. Alternatively, a user may supply their own configuration file with a command line argument of the executable, or define the database configuration via argument switches, or, alternatively via environment variables.\n\nFor inserting a VOEvent XML file into the FRBCat database, the decode_VOEvent executable is used:\n```\nusage: decode_VOEvent [-h] [-c MY_CONFIG] --dbName DBNAME [--dbHost DBHOST]\n                      [--dbPort DBPORT] --dbUser DBUSER\n                      [--dbPassword DBPASSWORD] [--CSV CSV] [--log LOG]\n                      [--zenodo ZENODO]\n                      [VOEvent [VOEvent ...]]\n\nProcess VOEvent XML file and add it to FRB database Args that start with '--'\n(eg. --dbName) can also be set in a config file\n(/etc/pyfrbcatdb/dbase.config or specified via -c). Config file syntax\nallows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c] (for details, see syntax at\nhttps://goo.gl/R74nmi). If an arg is specified in more than one place, then\ncommandline values override environment variables which override config file\nvalues which override defaults.\n\npositional arguments:\n  VOEvent               List of VOEvent XML files\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -c MY_CONFIG, --my-config MY_CONFIG\n                        config file path\n  --dbName DBNAME       name postgres database [env var: dbNameFRBCat]\n  --dbHost DBHOST       name postgres database [env var: dbHostFRBCat]\n  --dbPort DBPORT       name postgres database [env var: dbPortFRBCat]\n  --dbUser DBUSER       user postgres database [env var: dbUserFRBCat]\n  --dbPassword DBPASSWORD\n                        user postgres database password [env var:\n                        dbPasswordFRBCat]\n  --CSV CSV             CSV filename to dump database to [env var: CSVFRBCat]\n  --log LOG             log file, default=[HOME]/pyfrbcatdb_decode.log\n  --zenodo ZENODO       upload CSV to Zenodo, access token [env var: zenodoFRBCat]\n```\nFor inserting an image into the database, the frbcatdb-image executable is used. Apart from the database configuration, the tool takes two positional arguments. The first is the filename of the image to be added, the second is the 'id' in the 'radio measurement params' table that the image should be connected to:\n```\nusage: frbcatdb-image [-h] [-c MY_CONFIG] --dbName DBNAME [--dbHost DBHOST]\n                      [--dbPort DBPORT] --dbUser DBUSER\n                      [--dbPassword DBPASSWORD] [--caption CAPTION]\n                      [--title TITLE]\n                      filename rmpid\n\nCreate VOEvent XML file from FRB database Args that start with '--' (eg.\n--dbName) can also be set in a config file (/data/github/venv-\naa/etc/pyfrbcatdb/dbase.config or specified via -c). Config file syntax\nallows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c] (for details, see syntax at\nhttps://goo.gl/R74nmi). If an arg is specified in more than one place, then\ncommandline values override environment variables which override config file\nvalues which override defaults.\n\npositional arguments:\n  filename              Name of file to fetch from\n  rmpid                 rmp_id\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -c MY_CONFIG, --my-config MY_CONFIG\n                        config file path\n  --dbName DBNAME       name postgres database [env var: dbNameFRBCat]\n  --dbHost DBHOST       name postgres database [env var: dbHostFRBCat]\n  --dbPort DBPORT       name postgres database [env var: dbPortFRBCat]\n  --dbUser DBUSER       user postgres database [env var: dbUserFRBCat]\n  --dbPassword DBPASSWORD\n                        user postgres database password [env var:\n                        dbPasswordFRBCat]\n  --caption CAPTION     figure caption\n  --title TITLE         figure title\n```\n\nFor extracting a VOEvent from the FRBCat database, the create_VOEvent executable is used. Note that some features might still be missing for the current release from this utility.\n```\nusage: create_VOEvent [-h] [-c MY_CONFIG] --dbName DBNAME [--dbHost DBHOST]\n                      [--dbPort DBPORT] --dbUser DBUSER\n                      [--dbPassword DBPASSWORD] [--log LOG]\n                      frb_ids [frb_ids ...]\n\nCreate VOEvent XML file from FRB database Args that start with '--' (eg.\n--dbName) can also be set in a config file\n(/etc/pyfrbcatdb/dbase.config or specified via -c). Config\nfile syntax allows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c] (for details, see\nsyntax at https://goo.gl/R74nmi). If an arg is specified in more than one\nplace, then commandline values override environment variables which override\nconfig file values which override defaults.\n\npositional arguments:\n  frb_ids               List of frbs ids\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -c MY_CONFIG, --my-config MY_CONFIG\n                        config file path\n  --dbName DBNAME       name postgres database [env var: dbNameFRBCat]\n  --dbHost DBHOST       name postgres database [env var: dbHostFRBCat]\n  --dbPort DBPORT       name postgres database [env var: dbPortFRBCat]\n  --dbUser DBUSER       user postgres database [env var: dbUserFRBCat]\n  --dbPassword DBPASSWORD\n                        user postgres database password [env var:\n                        dbPasswordFRBCat]\n  --log LOG             log file, default=[HOME]/pyfrbcatdb_create.log\n```\n"
