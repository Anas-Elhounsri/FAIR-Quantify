If you're trying *SpeckCn2* with your data, your experience, questions, bugs you encountered, and suggestions for improvement are important to the success of the project.\n\nWe have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n## Questions, feedback, bugs\n\nUse the search function to see if someone else already ran across the same issue. Feel free to open a new [issue here](https://github.com/MALES-project/SpeckleCn2Profiler/issues) to ask a question, suggest improvements/new features, or report any bugs that you ran into.\n\n## Submitting changes\n\nEven better than a good bug report is a fix for the bug or the implementation of a new feature. We welcome any contributions that help improve the code.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an [issue](https://github.com/MALES-project/SpeckleCn2Profiler/issues) with the owners of this repository before making a change.\n\nContributions can come in the form of:\n\n- Bug fixes\n- New features\n- Improvement of existing code\n- Updates to the documentation\n- ... ?\n\nWe use the usual GitHub pull request flow. For more info see [GitHub's own documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nTypically this means:\n\n1. [Forking](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-forks) the repository and/or make a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-branches)\n2. Making your changes\n3. Make sure that the tests pass and add your own\n4. Update the documentation is updated for new features\n5. Pushing the code back to Github\n6. [Create a new Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n\nOne of the code owners will review your code and request changes if needed. Once your changes have been approved, your contributions will become part of *SpeckCn2*. \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Getting started with development\n\n### Setup\n\n*SpeckCn2* targets Python 3.9 or newer.\n\nClone the repository into the `speckcn2` directory:\n\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/MALES-project/SpeckleCn2Profiler speckcn2\ncd speckcn2\n```\n\nInitialize all submodules:\n```console\ngit submodule update --recursive --init\n```\n\nInstall using `virtualenv`:\n\n```console\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npython3 -m pip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\nAlternatively, install using Conda:\n\n```console\nconda create -n speckcn2 python=3.10\nconda activate speckcn2\npip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nSpeckCn2 uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the tests. You can run the tests for yourself using:\n\n```console\npytest\n```\n\nTo check coverage:\n\n```console\ncoverage run -m pytest\ncoverage report  # to output to terminal\ncoverage html    # to generate html report\n```\n\n### Building the documentation\n\nThe documentation is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the pages.\n\nTo build the documentation for yourself:\n\n```console\npip install -e .[docs]\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\nYou can find the documentation source in the [docs](https://github.com/XXX) directory.\nIf you are adding new pages, make sure to update the listing in the [`mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/XXX) under the `nav` entry.\n\n### Making a release\n\n1. Make a new [release](https://github.com/MALES-project/SpeckleCn2Profiler/releases).\n\n2. Under 'Choose a tag', set the tag to the new version. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/), so bump the version (*major*/*minor*/*patch*) as needed. Bumping the version is handled transparently by `bumpversion` in [this workflow](https://github.com/MALES-project/SpeckleCn2Profiler/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n3. The [upload to pypi](https://pypi.org/project/XXX) is triggered when a release is published and handled by [this workflow](https://github.com/MALES-project/SpeckleCn2Profiler/actions/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n4. The [upload to zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/XXX) is triggered when a release is published.\n"

        "value": "Optical satellite communications is a growing research field with bright commercial perspectives. One of the challenges for optical links through the atmosphere is turbulence, which is also apparent by the twinkling of stars. The reduction of the quality can be calculated, but it needs the turbulence strength over the path the optical beam is running. Estimation of the turbulence strength is done at astronomic sites, but not at rural or urban sites. To be able to do this, a simple instrument is required. We want to propose to use a single star Scintillation Detection and Ranging (SCIDAR), which is an instrument that can estimate the turbulence strength, based on the observation of a single star. Here, reliable signal processing of the received images of the star is most challenging. We propose to solve this by Machine Learning.\n \n"
