If you're trying *imas2xarray* with your data, your experience, questions, bugs you encountered, and suggestions for improvement are important to the success of the project.\n\nWe have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n## Questions, feedback, bugs\n\nUse the search function to see if someone else already ran accross the same issue. Feel free to open a new [issue here](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray/issues) to ask a question, suggest improvements/new features, or report any bugs that you ran into.\n\n## Submitting changes\n\nEven better than a good bug report is a fix for the bug or the implementation of a new feature. We welcome any contributions that help improve the code.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an [issue](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray/issues) with the owners of this repository before making a change.\n\nContributions can come in the form of:\n\n- Bug fixes\n- New features\n- Improvement of existing code\n- Updates to the documentation\n- ... ?\n\nWe use the usual GitHub pull-request flow. For more info see [GitHub's own documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nTypically this means:\n\n1. [Forking](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-forks) the repository and/or make a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-branches)\n2. Making your changes\n3. Make sure that the tests pass and add your own\n4. Update the documentation is updated for new features\n5. Pushing the code back to Github\n6. [Create a new Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n\nOne of the code owners will review your code and request changes if needed. Once your changes have been approved, your contributions will become part of *imas2xarray*. \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Getting started with development\n\n### Setup\n\n*Imas2xarray* targets Python 3.9 or newer.\n\nClone the repository into the `imas2xarray` directory:\n\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray\n```\n\nInstall using `virtualenv`:\n\n```console\ncd imas2xarray\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npython3 -m pip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\nAlternatively, install using Conda:\n\n```console\ncd imas2xarray\nconda create -n imas2xarray python=3.10\nconda activate imas2xarray\npip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\n*Imas2xarray* uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the tests. You can run the tests for yourself using:\n\n```console\npytest\n```\n\nTo check coverage:\n\n```console\ncoverage run -m pytest\ncoverage report  # to output to terminal\ncoverage html    # to generate html report\n```\n\n### Building the documentation\n\nThe documentation is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the pages.\n\nTo build the documentation for yourself:\n\n```console\npip install -e .[docs]\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\nYou can find the documentation source in the [docs](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray/tree/main/docs) directory.\nIf you are adding new pages, make sure to update the listing in the [`mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) under the `nav` entry.\n\n### Making a release\n\n1. Make a new [release](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray/releases).\n\n2. Under 'Choose a tag', set the tag to the new version. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/), so bump the version (*major*/*minor*/*patch*) as needed. Bumping the version is handled transparently by `bumpversion` in [this workflow](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n3. The [upload to pypi](https://pypi.org/project/imas2xarray) is triggered when a release is published and handled by [this workflow](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray/actions/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n4. The [upload to zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10256040) is triggered when a release is published.\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
