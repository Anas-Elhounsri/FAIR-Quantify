If you're trying *duqtools* with your data, your experience, questions, bugs you encountered, and suggestions for improvement are important to the success of the project.\n\nWe have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n## Questions, feedback, bugs\n\nUse the search function to see if someone else already ran accross the same issue. Feel free to open a new [issue here](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/issues) to ask a question, suggest improvements/new features, or report any bugs that you ran into.\n\n## Submitting changes\n\nEven better than a good bug report is a fix for the bug or the implementation of a new feature. We welcome any contributions that help improve the code.\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an [issue](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/issues) with the owners of this repository before making a change.\n\nContributions can come in the form of:\n\n- Bug fixes\n- New features\n- Improvement of existing code\n- Updates to the documentation\n- ... ?\n\nWe use the usual GitHub pull-request flow. For more info see [GitHub's own documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nTypically this means:\n\n1. [Forking](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-forks) the repository and/or make a [new branch](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-branches)\n2. Making your changes\n3. Make sure that the tests pass and add your own\n4. Update the documentation is updated for new features\n5. Pushing the code back to Github\n6. [Create a new Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n\nOne of the code owners will review your code and request changes if needed. Once your changes have been approved, your contributions will become part of *duqtools*. \ud83c\udf89\n\n## Getting started with development\n\n### Setup\n\n*Duqtools* targets Python 3.9 or newer and is compatible with python 3.10, which is the version available on [eufus](https://wiki.eufus.eu/doku.php).\n\nClone the repository into the `duqtools` directory:\n\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools\n```\n\nInstall using `virtualenv`:\n\n```console\ncd duqtools\npython3 -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npython3 -m pip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\nAlternatively, install using Conda:\n\n```console\ncd duqtools\nconda create -n duqtools python=3.10\nconda activate duqtools\npip install -e .[develop]\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nDuqtools uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to run the tests. You can run the tests for yourself using:\n\n```console\npytest\n```\n\nTo check coverage:\n\n```console\ncoverage run -m pytest\ncoverage report  # to output to terminal\ncoverage html    # to generate html report\n```\n\n### Running IMAS tests\n\nTests that require IMAS make use of the [containerized_runs](https://github.com/duqtools/containerized_runs) repository.\n\nYou can run the tests following the instructions in the repo, or locally.\nClone the repository and set the `CONTAINERIZED_RUNS_DIR` environment variable.\nFor example, on Gateway:\n\n```console\ncd $JRUNS\ngit clone git@github.com:duqtools/containerized_runs\nexport CONTAINERIZED_RUNS_DIR=\"$JRUNS/containerized_runs\"\n```\n\n\n### Building the documentation\n\nThe documentation is written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), and uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the pages.\n\nTo build the documentation for yourself:\n\n```console\npip install -e .[docs]\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\nYou can find the documentation source in the [docs](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/tree/main/docs) directory.\nIf you are adding new pages, make sure to update the listing in the [`mkdocs.yml`](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) under the `nav` entry.\n\n### Making a release\n\n1. Make a new [release](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/releases).\n\n2. Under 'Choose a tag', set the tag to the new version. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/), so bump the version (*major*/*minor*/*patch*) as needed. Bumping the version is handled transparently by `bumpversion` in [this workflow](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n3. The [upload to pypi](https://pypi.org/project/duqtools) is triggered when a release is published and handled by [this workflow](https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/actions/workflows/publish.yaml).\n\n4. The [upload to zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7817160) is triggered when a release is published.\n"

        "description": "This release of duqtools splits off the python API into its own library. This is a major change to the internals of duqtools that should not affect normal use of duqtools through the CLI. `imas2xarray` now handles the variable mappings to the IMAS data structure, and includes an api to load these data into xarray from hdf5. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/duqtools/imas2xarray).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Add `compute_from` to variable operations, and other improvements by @v1kko in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/675\r\n* Add option to customize axes in dashboard by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/677\r\n* Split off `imas2xarray` by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/682\r\n\r\n## Under the hood\r\n\r\n* Prepare `imas2xarray` submodule by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/680\r\n* Single source vars by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/684\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix imas tests by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/676\r\n* Dimensions Fix: recognize that some numpy ufuncs do not have `out` as a keyword by @v1kko in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/678\r\n\r\n## Maintanance\r\n\r\n* Switch to bump-my-version by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/686\r\n* Directly generate coverage badge svg by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/687\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/compare/2.0.0...3.0.0",

        "description": "This release focuses on expanding the use-cases for `duqtools`. We have added a way to directly specify which operations to always apply to a dataset (`operations` keyword in `duqtools.yaml`). This will make it easier to separate 'fixes' to a dataset from sampling variables or for generating base runs.\r\n\r\nThis release also introduces a Python API, so that runs can be created and submitted from a Python script or Jupyter Notebook. For more information, see the [documentation](https://duqtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/create_api/).\r\n\r\nThe `duqduq` CLI is also more flexible to specify which runs to create and submit, which will give more control over your data for large scale validation.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* Add path and imas filters for duqduq create and submit by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/593\r\n* Update duqtools init template by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/594\r\n* Add operations keyword to create config by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/598\r\n* Add workflow for generating base and uq runs from a single template config by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/603\r\n* Add python api for duqtools create and submit by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/606\r\n\r\n## Under the hood\r\n\r\n* Revise config loading by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/604\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* Update contributing guidelines by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/592\r\n* Add documentation for setup by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/595\r\n* Add quickstart example to cli by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/596\r\n* Add option to create base run only by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/600\r\n* Add docs for top level keywords in config by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/602\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Remove print statement in operations.py by @v1kko in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/589\r\n* Do not copy restart files if restart toggle is off by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/599\r\n* Fixes missing keyword argument in `duqduq submit -array` by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/601\r\n* Make dashboard merge compatible with local imas database by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/607\r\n\r\n## Maintanance\r\n\r\n* Add linting and autoformatting for notebooks by @stefsmeets in https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/pull/591\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/duqtools/duqtools/compare/1.7.0...1.8.0",
