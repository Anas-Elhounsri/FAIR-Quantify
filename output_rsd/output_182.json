This id will be used to populate the DB with test data\nHow to get the ID is explained [here](https://github.com/PerfectFit-project/niceday-components/tree/main/niceday-api#what-is-my-user-id). \nThe .env file must also contain `DATABASE_URL`, which points to the location of the perfectfit database on a running postgres server.\nFor local development this will normally be: `postgresql+psycopg2://root:root@db/perfectfit`\nSee .env-example for a template. The values in `.env-example` are already set to work for local runs with docker compose (with the exception of THERAPIST_EMAIL_ADDRESS, THERAPIST_ID and THERAPIST_PASSWORD, which must be provided).\n2.
