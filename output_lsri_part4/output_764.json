        "value": "# Contributing to pathfindR development\n\nThe goal of this guide is to help you in contributing to pathfindR. The guide is divided into two main pieces:\n\n1. Filing a bug report or feature request in an issue.\n1. Suggesting a change via a pull request.\n\nPlease note that pathfindR is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By contributing to this project, \nyou agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## Issues\n\nWhen filing an issue, the most important thing is to include a minimal \nreproducible example so that we can quickly verify the problem, and then figure \nout how to fix it. There are three things you need to include to make your \nexample reproducible: required packages, data, code.\n\n1.  **Packages** should be loaded at the top of the script, so it's easy to\n    see which ones the example needs.\n  \n1.  The easiest way to include **data** is to use `dput()` to generate the R code \n    to recreate it. For example, to recreate the `mtcars` dataset in R,\n    I'd perform the following steps:\n  \n       1. Run `dput(mtcars)` in R\n       2. Copy the output\n       3. In my reproducible script, type `mtcars <- ` then paste.\n       \n    But even better is if you can create a `data.frame()` with just a handful\n    of rows and columns that still illustrates the problem.\n    \n    For more complex **data**, you can use `saveRDS()` to save the object and attach it with the issue.\n  \n1.  Spend a little bit of time ensuring that your **code** is easy for others to\n    read:\n  \n    * make sure you've used spaces and your variable names are concise, but\n      informative\n  \n    * use comments to indicate where your problem lies\n  \n    * do your best to remove everything that is not related to the problem.  \n     The shorter your code is, the easier it is to understand.\n\nYou can check you have actually made a reproducible example by starting up a \nfresh R session and pasting your script in.\n\n## Pull requests\n\nTo contribute a change to pathfindR, you follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a branch in git and make your changes.\n1. Push branch to github and issue pull request (PR).\n1. Discuss the pull request.\n1. Iterate until either we accept the PR or decide that it's not\n   a good fit for pathfindR.\n\nIf you're not familiar with git or github, please start by reading <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html>\n\n## Branch Naming Conventions\n\nWe want to follow the branch following naming convention during development:\n\n### Feature Development:\n- Use the prefix `feature/` followed by a brief description of the feature.\n- Example: `feature/add-new-method`, `feature/update-active-snw-search`\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n- Use the prefix `fix/` followed by a description of the fix or the issue number.\n- Example: `fix/correct-typo`, `fix/#123`\n\n### Documentation:\n- Use the prefix `docs/` for updates exclusively in the documentation.\n- Example: `docs/update-readme`, `docs/add-examples`\n\n### Refactoring:\n- Use `refactor/` when modifying the structure and organization of code without changing its external behavior.\n- Example: `refactor/reorganize-tests`, `refactor/optimization-code`\n\n### Testing:\n- Use `test/` for changes related to testing only.\n- Example: `test/add-unit-tests`, `test/expand-tests`\n\n### Releases (for maintainers only):\n- Use `release/` for preparing a new version release.\n- Example: `release/v1.0.0`, `release/v2.0.0`\n\n### Chore/Maintenance (mostly for maintainers):\n- Use `chore/` for mundane tasks like updating dependencies or minor tasks that don't modify the source code.\n- Example: `chore/update-packages`, `chore/license-update`\n\n### Experimental:\n- Use `experiment/` for experimental work that might not be merged into the `master`\n- Example: `experiment/new-algorithm`, `exp/test-new-library`\n\n# Attribution\nThis Contributing guide was adapted from [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2)\n"

After mapping the\ninput genes with the associated p-values onto the PIN, active subnetwork\nsearch is performed. The resulting active subnetworks are then filtered\nbased on their scores and the number of significant genes they contain. \n> An active subnetwork can be defined as a group of interconnected genes\n> in a protein-protein interaction network (PIN) that predominantly\n> consists of significantly altered genes. In other words, active\n> subnetworks define distinct disease-associated sets of interacting\n> genes, whether discovered through the original analysis or discovered\n> because of being in interaction with a significant gene. \nThese filtered lists of active subnetworks are then used for enrichment\nanalyses, i.e., using the genes in each of the active subnetworks, the\nsignificantly enriched terms (pathways/gene sets) are identified.\nEnriched terms with adjusted p-values larger than the given threshold\nare discarded, and the lowest adjusted p-value (among all active\nsubnetworks) for each term is kept. This process of\n`active subnetwork search + enrichment analyses` is repeated for a\nselected number of iterations, performed in parallel.

        "description": "## Major Changes\r\n- updated the java active subnetwork search component and added the `seedForRandom` argument in `active_snw_search()`to ensure reproducibility. By default behavior, in `run_pathfindR()`, a seed is set for each iteration to produce reproducible results (#108)\r\n- as the example input/output data were renamed for convenience in 'pathfindR.data' v2.0, 'pathfindR' now depends on pathfindR.data (>= 2.0) \r\n- refactored/simplified `run_pathfindR()`\r\n- visualization enriched term diagrams are now NOT part of `run_pathfindR()`\r\n- default behavior of `run_pathfindR()` is now to run in a temporary directory. The user can still set `output_dir` to run in a specified directory and also produce HTML reports\r\n- in `hierarchical_term_clustering()`, update the sequence of number of clusters for which silhouette width is calculated for choosing the optimal number of clusters. This should speed up the function for cases with a large number of enriched terms\r\n- updated the relevant vignettes to reflect the implemented changes\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n- fixed a minor issue in `return_pin_path()` where the PIN was not properly read (#157)\r\n",

        "description": "## Major Changes\r\n- Replaced most occurrences of \"pathway\" to \"term\". This was adapted because \"term\" reflects the utility of the package better. The enrichment and clustering approaches work with any kind of gene set data (be it pathway gene sets, gene ontology gene sets, motif gene sets etc.) Accordingly:\r\n  - `DESCRIPTION` was updated\r\n  - The functions `annotate_pathway_DEGs()`, `calculate_pw_scores()`, `cluster_pathways()`, `fuzzy_pw_clustering()`, `hierarchical_pw_clustering()`, `visualize_pw_interactions()` and `visualize_pws()` were renamed to \r\n  `annotate_term_DEGs()`, `score_terms()`, `cluster_enriched_terms()`, `fuzzy_term_clustering()`, `hierarchical_term_clustering()`, `visualize_term_interactions()` and `visualize_terms()` respectively\r\n  - The Rmd template file for the report `enriched_pathways.Rmd` was renamed to `enriched_terms.Rmd`\r\n  - All the Rmd template files for the report were updated\r\n  - Documentation of each function was updated accordingly\r\n- Added the visualization function `term_gene_graph()`, which creates a graph of enriched terms - involved genes\r\n- Made changes in `enrichment()` and `enrichment_analyses()` to get enrichment results faster\r\n- Added the function `fetch_gene_set()` for obtaining gene set data more easily\r\n- Terms in gene sets can now be filtered according to the number of genes a term contains (controlled by `min_gset_size`, `max_gset_size` in `fetch_gene_set()` and `run_pathfindR()`) \r\n- Added the argument `gaCrossover` during active subnetwork search which controls the probability of a crossover in GA (default = 1, i.e. always perform crossover)\r\n- Added unit tests using `testthat`\r\n- Updated all gene sets data\r\n- Updated all RA example data\r\n- The vignettes were updated\r\n- Updated all PIN data\r\n- Improved speed of kappa matrix calculation (`create_kappa_matrix()`)\r\n- Added vignette for non-Homo-sapiens organisms\r\n- Added Mus musculus (mmu) data:\r\n  - `mmu_kegg_genes` & `mmu_kegg_descriptions`: mmu KEGG gene sets data\r\n  - mmu STRING PIN\r\n  - `myeloma_input` & `myeloma_output`: example mmu input and output data\r\n- Added the STRING PIN (combined score >= 400)\r\n- The argument `sig_gene_thr` in subnetwork filtering via `filterActiveSnws()` now serves the threshold proportion of significant genes in the active subnetwork. e.g., if there are 100 significant genes and `sig_gene_thr = 0.03`, subnetwork that contain at least 3 (100 x 0.03) significant genes will be accepted for further analysis\r\n- Removed `pathview` dependency by implementing colored pathway diagram visualization function using `KEGGREST` and `KEGGgraph`\r\n\r\n## Minor changes and bug fixes\r\n- In `hierarchical_term_clustering()`, redefined the distance measure as `1 - kappa statistic`\r\n- Fixed minor issue in `cluster_graph_vis()` (during the calculations for additional node colors)\r\n- Removed title from graph visualization of hierarchical clustering in `cluster_graph_vis()`\r\n- In `active_snw_search()`, unnecessary warnings during active subnetwork search were removed\r\n- Fixed minor issue in `enrichment_chart()`, supplying fuzzy clustered results no longer raises an error\r\n- Added new checks in `input_testing()` and `input_processing()` to ensure that both the initial input data frame and the processed input data frame for active subnetwork search contain at least 2 genes (to fix the corner case encountered in issue #17)\r\n- Fixed minor issue in `enrichment_chart()`, ensuring that bubble sizes displayed in the legend (proportional to # of DEGs) are integers\r\n- In `enrichment_chart()`, added the arguments `num_bubbles` (default is 4) to control number of bubbles displayed in the legend and `even_breaks` (default is `TRUE`) to indicate if even increments of breaks are required\r\n- Updated the logo\r\n- Minor fix in `term_gene_graph()` (create the igraph object as an undirected graph for better auto layout)\r\n- Minor fix in `visualize_term_interactions()`. The legend no longer displays \"Non-input Active Snw. Genes\" if they were not provided\r\n- The argument `human_genes` in `run_pathfindR()` and `input_processing()` was renamed as `convert2alias`\r\n- The gene symbols in the input data frame, the PIN and the gene sets are now turned into uppercase (for obtaining the best overlap)\r\n- Added the argument `top_terms` to `enrichment_chart()`, controlling the number top enriched terms to plot (default is 10)\r\n- Other minor bug/error fixes",

        "description": "## Major Changes\r\n- Separated the steps of the function `run_pathfindR` into individual functions: `active_snw_search`, `enrichment_analyses`, `summarize_enrichment_results`, `annotate_pathway_DEGs`, `visualize_pws`.\r\n- renamed the function `pathmap` as `visualize_hsa_KEGG`, updated the function to produce different visualizations for inputs with binary change values (ordered) and no change values (the `input_processing` function, assigns a change value of 100 to all).\r\n- Created new the visualization function `visualize_pw_interactions`, which creates PNG files visualizing the interactions (in the selected PIN) of genes involved in the given pathways.\r\n- Added new vignette, describing the step-by-step execution of the pathfindR workflow\r\n- Changed clustering metric to kappa statistic, created the new clustering related functions `create_kappa_matrix`, `hierarchical_pw_clustering`, `fuzzy_pw_clustering` and `cluster_pathways`.\r\n- Implemented the new function `cluster_graph_vis` for visualing graph diagrams of clustering results.\r\n\r\n## Minor changes and bug fixes\r\n- Fixed the bug where the arguments `score_quan_thr` and `sig_gene_thr` for `run_pathfindR` were not being utilized.\r\n- in `run_pathfindR`, added message at the end of run, reporting the number enriched pathways.\r\n- the function `run_pathfindR` now creates a variable `org_dir` that is the \"path/to/original/working/directory\". `org_dir` is used in multiple funtions to return to the original working directory if anything fails. This changes the previous behavior where if a function stopped with an error the directory was changed to \"..\", i.e. the parent directory. This change was adapted so that the user is returned to the original working directory if they supply a recursive output folder (`output_dir`, e.g. \"./ALL_RESULTS/RESULT_A\"). \r\n- in `input_processing`, added the argument `human_genes` to only perform alias symbol conversion when human gene symbols are provided. - Updated the Rmd files used to create the report HTML files\r\n- Added the data for `GO-All`, all annotations in the GO database (BP+MF+CC)\r\n- Updated the vignette `pathfindR - An R Package for Pathway Enrichment Analysis Utilizing Active Subnetworks` to reflect the new functionalities.\r\n",
