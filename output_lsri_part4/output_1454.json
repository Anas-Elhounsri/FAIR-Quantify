Please don't. It benefits everyone for discussions to happen in public where they're indexed by search engines, enabling users to find solutions to their problems from previous public discussions. \n\n## Code contributions\n\n### Broad overview of contributing workflow\n\n* Fork this repo to your Github account\n* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/taxize.git`\n* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `taxize` at `ropensci/taxize`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ropensci/taxize.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step\n* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch)\n* Please do write a test(s) for your changes if they affect code and not just docs (see Tests below)\n* Push up to your account\n* Submit a pull request to home base at `ropensci/taxize`\n\n### Tests\n\nTo add tests, go to the folder `tests/testthat/`. Tests are generally organized as individual files for each exported function from the package (that is, listed as an export in the `NAMESPACE` file). If you are adding a new exported function, add a new test file. If you are changing an existing function, work in the tests file for that function, unless it doesn't have tests, in which case make a new test file.\n\nThe book R packages book provides [a chapter on testing in general](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html). Do consult that first if you aren't familiar with testing in R.\n\nThe easiest set up to run tests is from within an R session:\n\n```r\nlibrary(devtools)\nlibrary(testthat)\n# loads the package\nload_all()\n```\n\nTo test an individual test file\n\n```r\ntest_file(\"tests/testthat/test-foobar.R\")\n```\n\nTo run all tests\n\n```r\ndevtools::test()\n```\n\nIf you are running tests that have `skip_on_cran()` in them, set `Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = \"true\")` prior to running tests.\n\n\n### Making changes\n\nIn addition to changing the code, do make sure to udpate the documentation if applicable. The R packages book book has a [chapter on documentation](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) you should read if you aren't familiar.\n\nAfter code and documentation has been changed, update documentation by running either `devtools::document()` or `roxygen2::roxygenise()`.\n\nMake sure if you change what packages or even functions within packages are imported, most likely add the package to Imports in the DESCRIPTION file and list what functions are imported in the `taxize-package.R` file.\n\nBe conservative about adding new dependencies.\n\n\n### Style\n\n* Make sure code, documentation, and comments are no more than 80 characters in width.\n* Use `<-` instead of `=` for assignment\n* Always use `snake_case` (and all lowercase) instead of `camelCase`\n\n## Also, check out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org)\n"

Associated changes have been made throughout the package, eg. `resolve()` no longer has an option for tnrs, etc. (#841) (#842)\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* new article/vignette added on issues with taxonomic ranks, e.g., \"NCBI is weird\", and how rank information is maintained and used within taxize (#852)\r\n* vignettes are no longer on cran - find them at the docs site linked in DESCRIPTION (#855)\r\n* re-instate a `tol_resolve()` test following new version of `rotl` package on cran (#816)\r\n* improve `class2tree()` function documentation regarding how the function works in more detail (#849) (#851)\r\n* improvements for WORMS, applies to functions `worms_downstream()`, `children(..., db=\"worms\")` and `downstream(..., db=\"worms\")`: now paginate automatically for the user to get all results, and allow parameter `marine_only` to be passed through the high level functions `children()`/`downstream()` down to `worrms::wm_children()` where it toggles whether marine only results are returned (#848) thanks @oharac !\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* fix to `ncbi_downstream()` (which cascades up to `downstream(..., db=\"ncbi\")`): an unneeded line of code was removed that was also throwing an error in some cases (#850)\r\n* fixes for WORMS ranks, applies to functions `worms_downstream()`, `children(..., db=\"worms\")` and `downstream(..., db=\"worms\")`: added ranks `epifamily` and `infraphylum`. In addition, when a rank is missing in data returned from WORMS, we'll change the missing rank to \"no rank\" (#847)",

This was causing some problems in `class2tree()`. Problem sorted out now (#835) (#838) (#839) (#840)\n\n\n",

        "description": "### NEW FEATURES\n\n* Many of the functions in taxize share similar types of inputs (e.g., scientific names, or common names), but many different parameter names are used to refer to the same thing. We've standardized parameter names to make user understanding easier as the user uses different functions. TLDR: `sci` will always only accept a scientific name; `com` accdepts only a common name; `id` accepts a taxonomic identifier; `sci_com` accepts or scientific or common name; `sci_id` accepts a scientific name or taxonomic identifier. In most cases we have retained the old parameter name and you can still use it but you get a warning with information. In a future package version the replaced parameters will be removed completely. See https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues/723 for tables covering the functions affected, their old and new parameter names (#723) (#829)\n\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n\n* upgraded APG datasets (`apg_families` and `apg_order`) to v14 (from July 2017) (#827)\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* fix to `worrms_downstream()`: three rank names were not accounted for in our internal set of ranks (suptertribe, subterclass, parvorder) (#824)\n* `classification.gbifid` was returning a duplicate last taxon, i.e., the last two rows in the output data.frame were the same. fixed. (#825)\n* fixed issue in `lowest_common()` due to problem in `classification.uid()` when a taxon UID was merged into another taxon (#828)\n\n\n",

        "description": "### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* all `get_*` functions gain some new features (associated new fxns are `taxon_last` and `taxon_clear`): a) nicer messages printed to the console when iterating through taxa, and a summary at the end of what was done; and b) state is now saved when running `get_*` functions. That is, in an object external to the `get_*` function call we keep track of what happened, so that if an error is encountered, you can easily restart where you left off; this is especially useful when dealing with a large number of inputs to a `get_*` function. To utilize, pass the output of `taxon_last()` to a `get_*` function call. Associated with these changes are new package imports: R6, crayon and cli (#736) (#757)\r\n* gains a new function `taxize_options()` to set options when using taxize. the first reason for the function is to set two options for the above item for `get_*` functions: `taxon_state_messages` to allow taxon state tracking messages in `get_*` functions or not, and `quiet=TRUE` quiets output from the `taxize_options()` function itself\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* in `id2name()` and `worms_downstream()` use `worrms::wm_record` instead of `worrms::wm_record_` for newest version of `worrms` (#760)\r\n* many `get_*` functions and `col_downstream()` parameter `verbose` changed to `messages` to not conflict with a `verbose` curl options parameter passed in to `crul`\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* fix to http request processing for COL - sometimes errors, and gives a message in the response body, but DOES NOT give the appropriate error HTTP status code - need to always do a check for COL responses (#755) (#756) thanks @dougwyu\r\n* fix to `gbif_downstream()` - GBIF in some cases returns a rank of \"unranked\", which we hadn't accounted for in internal rank processing code (#758) thanks @ocstringham",

Now all `get_*` functions check for a direct match. Of course if there is a direct match with more than 1 result, you still get the prompt asking you which name you want.

Please do let us know if you find any problems with any EOL functions (#717) (#718)\r\n* As part of EOL changes, the default `db` value for `comm2sci()` and `sci2comm()` is now `ncbi` instead of `eol`\r\n* EUBON base URL now https instead of http\r\n* A number of `get_*()` functions changed parameter `verbose` to `messages` to not conflict with `verbose` passed down to `crul::HttpClient`\r\n* ping functions: `ncbi_ping()` reworked to allow use of your api key as a parameter or pulled from your environemnt; `eol_ping()` using https instead of http, and parsing JSON instead of XML.\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* `get_eolid()` was erroring when no results found for a query due to not assigning an internal variable (#701) (#709) thanks for the fix @taddallas\r\n* `get_tolid()` was erroring when values were `NULL` - now replacing all `NULLL` with `NA_character_` to make `data.table::rbindlist()` happy (#710) (#711) thanks @gpli for the fix\r\n* add additional rows to the `rank_ref` data.frame of taxonomic ranks: species subgroup, forma, varietas, clade, megacohort, supercohort, cohort, subcohort, infracohort. when there's no matched rank errors can result in many of the downstream functions. The data.frame now has 43 rows. (#720) (#727)\r\n* fix to `downstream()` and `ncbi_get_taxon_summary()`: change in `ncbi_get_taxon_summary` to break up queries into smaller chunks to avoid HTTP 414 errors (\"URI too long\") (#727) (#730) thanks for reporting @fischhoff and  @benjaminschwetz \r\n* a number of fixes internally (not user facing) to comply with upcoming R-devel changes for checking length greater than 1 in logical statements (#731)",

        "description": "## Installation\r\n\r\nStalled on CRAN. Install like \r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"taxize\", repos = c(\"http://packages.ropensci.org\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\n```r\r\nremotes::install_github(\"ropensci/taxize\")\r\n# OR\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"ropensci/taxize\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## NEWS\r\n\r\n### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* `class2tree()` gets a major overhaul thanks to @gedankenstuecke and @trvinh (!!). The function now takes unnamed ranks into account when clustering, which fixes problem where trees were unresolved for many splits as the named taxonomy levels were shared between them. Now it makes full use of the NCBI Taxonomy string, including the unnamed ranks, leading to higher resolution trees that have less multifurcations (#611) (#634)\r\n* Added support throughout package for use of NCBI Entrez API keys - NCBI now strongly encourages their use and you get a higher rate limit when you use one. See `?taxize-authentication` for help. Importantly, note that API key names (both R options and environment variables) have changed. They are now the same for R options and env vars: TROPICOS_KEY, EOL_KEY, PLANTMINER_KEY, ENTREZ_KEY. You no longer need an API key for Plantminer. (#640) (#646)\r\n* New author Zebulun Arendsee (@arendsee)\r\n* New package dependencies: `crul` and `zoo`\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* In `downstream()` we now pass on `limit` and `start` parameters to `gbif_downstream()`; we weren't doing that before; the two parameters control pagination (#638)\r\n*  `genbank2uid()` now returns the correct ID when there are multiple possibilities and invalid IDs no longer make whole batches fail (#642) thanks @zachary-foster\r\n* `children()` outputs made more consistent for certain cases when no results found for searches (#648) (#649) thanks @arendsee\r\n* Improve `downstream()` by passing `...` (additional parameters) down to `ncbi_children()` used internally. allows e.g., use of `ambiguous` parameter in `ncbi_children()` allows you to remove ambiguousl named nodes (#653) (#654) thanks @arendsee\r\n* swapped out use of `httr` for `crul` in EOL and Tropics functions - note that this won't affect you unless you're passing curl options. see package `crul` for help on curl options. Along with this change, the parameter `verbose` has changed to `messages` (for toggling printing of information messages)\r\n\r\n### DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\n* Added additional text to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for how to contribute to the test suite (#635)\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* `genbank2uid` now returns the correct ID when there are multiple possibilities and invalid IDs no longer make whole batches fail.\r\n* Fix to `downstream()`: passing numeric taxon ids to the function while using `db=\"ncbi\"` wasn't working (#641) thanks @arendsee\r\n* Fix to `children()`: passing numeric taxon ids to the function while using `db=\"worms\"` wasn't working (#650) (#651) thanks @arendsee\r\n* `synonyms_df()` - that attemps to combine many outputs from the `synonyms()` function -  now removes NA/NULL/empy outputs before attempting the combination (#636)\r\n* Fix to `gnr_resolve()`: before if `preferred_data_sources` was used, you would get the preferred data but only a few columns of the response. We now return all fields; however, we only return the preferred data part when that parameter is used  (#656)\r\n* Fixes to `children()`. It was returning unexpected results for amgiguous taxonomic names (e.g., there's some insects that are returned when searching within Bacteria). It was also failing when one tried to get the children of a root taxon (e.g., the children of the NCBI id 131567). (#639) (#647) fixed via PR (#659) thanks @arendsee and @zachary-foster\r\n",

(#550) from (#547) discussion,\n  thanks @ahhurlbert ! see also (#551)\n- Change all `xml2::xml_find_one()` to `xml2::xml_find_first()`\n  for new `xml2` version (#546)\n- `gnr_resolve()` now retains user supplied taxa that had no matches -\n  this could affect your code, make sure to check your existing code (#558)\n- `gnr_resolve()` - stop sorting output data.frame, so order of rows\n  in output data.frame now same as user input vector/list (#559)\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- Fixed internal fxn `sub_rows()` inside of most `get_*()` functions\n  to not fail when the data.frame rows were less than that requested by\n  the user in `rows` parameter (#556)\n- Fixed `get_gbifid()`, as sometimes calls failed because we now\n  return numberic IDs but used to return character IDs (#555)\n- Fix to all `get_()` functions to call the internal `sub_rows()`\n  function later in the function flow so as not to interfere with\n  taxonomic based filtering (e.g., user filtering by a taxonomic rank)\n  (#555)\n- Fix to `gnr_resolve()`, to not fail on parsing when no data\n  returned when a preferred data source specified (#557)\n",

        "description": "## NEW FEATURES\n- New function `lowest_common()` for obtaining the lowest common taxon and \n  rank for a given taxon name or ID. Methods so far for ITIS, NCBI, and GBIF (#505)\n- New contributor James O'Donnell (@jimmyodonnell) (via #505)\n- Now importing `rredlist` [rredlist](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rredlist)\n- New function `iucn_summary_id()` - same as `iucn_summary()`, except takes\n  IUCN IDs as input instead of taxonomic names (#493)\n\n## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- `iucn_summary()` fixes, long story short: a number of bug fixes, and uses\n  the new IUCN API via the newish package `rredlist` when IDs are given as input, \n  but uses the old IUCN API when taxonomic names given. Also: gains new parameter `distr_details`\n  (#174) (#472) (#487) (#488)\n- Replaced `XML` with `xml2` for XML parsing (#499)\n- Fixes to internal use of `httr::content` to explicitly state `encoding=\"UTF-8\"` (#498)\n- `gnr_resolve()` now outputs a column (`user_supplied_name`) for the exact input taxon \n  name - facilitates merging data back to original data inputs (#486) thanks @Alectoria\n- `eol_dataobjects()` gains new parameter `taxonomy` to toggle whether to return \n  any taxonomy details from different data providers (#497)\n- Catalogue of Life URLs changed - updated all appropriate COL functions to use \n  the new URLs (#501)\n- `classification()` was giving back rank values in mixed case from different data \n  providers (e.g., `class` vs. `Class`). All rank values are now all lowercase (#504)\n- Changed number of results returned from internal GBIF search in `get_gbfid` to \n  50 from 20. Gives back more results, so more likely to get the thing searched for (#513)\n- Fix to `gni_search()` to make all output columns `character` class\n- `iucn_id()`, `tpl_families()`, and `tpl_get()` all gain a new parameter `...` to \n  pass on curl options to `httr::GET()`\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- Fixes to `get_eolid()`: URI returned now always has the pageid, and goes to the \n  right place; API key if passed in now actually used, woopsy (#484)\n- Fixes to `get_uid()`: when a taxon not found, the \"match\" attribute was saying\n  found sometimes anyway - that is now fixed; additionally, fixed docs to correctly\n  state that we give back `'NA due to ask=FALSE'` when `ask = FALSE` (#489) Additionally, \n  made this doc fix in other `get_*()` function docs\n- Fix to `apgOrders()` function (#490)\n- Fixes to `tp_search()` which fixes `get_tpsid()`: Tropicos doesn't allow periods (`.`) in \n  query strings, so those are URL encoded now; Tropicos doesn't like sub-specific rank names\n  in name query strings, so we warn when those are found, but don't alter user inputs; and \n  improved docs to be more clear about how the function fails (#491) thanks @scelmendorf !\n- Fix to `classification(db = \"itis\")` to fail better when no taxa found (#495) thanks @ashenkin !\n- `eol_pages()` fixes: the EOL API route for this method gained a new parameter `taxonomy`, \n  this function gains that parameter. That change caused this fxn to fail. Now fixed. Also,\n  parameter `subject` changed to `subjects` (#500)\n- Fix to `col_search()` due to when `misapplied name` come back as a data slot. There \n  was previously no parser for that type. Now there is, and it works (#512)\n",

        "description": "## NEW FEATURES\n- Now requires `R >= 3.2.1`. Good idea to update your R installation anyway (#476)\n- New function `ion()` for obtaining data from Index of Organism Names (#345)\n- New function `eubon()` for obtaining data from EU (European Union) BON\n  taxonomy (#466) Note that you may onloy get partial results for some requests\n  as paging isn't implemented yet in the EU BON API (#481)\n- New suite of functions, with prefix `fg_*()` for obtaining data from Index\n  Fungorum. More work has to be done yet on this data source, but these initial\n  functions allow some Index Fungorum data access (#471)\n- New function `gbif_downstream()` for obtaining downstream names from\n  GBIF's backbone taxonomy. Also available in `downstream()`, where you can\n  request downstream names from GBIF, along with other data sources (#414)\n\n## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- Note added in docs for all `db` parameters to warn users that if they\n  provide the wrong `db` value for the given taxon ID, they can get data\n  back, but it would be wrong. That is, all taxonomic data sources available\n  in `taxize` use their own unique IDs, so a single ID value can be in multiple\n  data sources, even though the ID refers to different taxa in each data source.\n  There is no way we can think of to prevent this from happening, so be cautious.\n  (#465)\n- A note added to all IUCN functions to warn users that sometimes incorrect\n  data is returned. This is beyond our control, as sometimes IUCN itself gives\n  back incorrect data, and sometimes EOL/Global Names (which we use in some of\n  the IUCN functions) give back incorrect data. (#468) (#473) (#174) (472) (#475)\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- Fix to `gnr_resolve()` to by default capitalize first name of a name string\n  passed to the function. GNR is case sensitive, so case matters (#469)\n\n## DEFUNCT\n- `phylomatic_tree()` and `phylomatic_format()` are defunct. They were deprecated\n  in recent versions, but are now gone. See the new package `brranching` for\n  Phylomatic data (#479)\n",

The input taxa that have no match at all are returned in\n  an attribute with name `not_known` (#448)\n- updated some functions to work with to R >3.2.x\n- In `vascan_search()` changed `callopts` parameter to `...` to pass in curl\n  options to the request. \n- In `ipni_search()` changed `callopts` parameter to `...` to pass in curl\n  options to the request. In addition, better http error handling, and \n  added a test suite for this function. (#458)\n- `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` now used for `gibf_parse()` (https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/commit/c0c4175d3a0b24d403f18c057258b67d3fbf17f0)\n- Made nearly all column headers and list names lowercase to simplify\n  indexing to elements, as well as combining outputs.

Not needed anymore because uBio \n  dropped.\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- `gnr_resolve()` failed when no canonical form was found.\n- Fixed `gnr_resolve()` when no results found when `best_match_only=TRUE` (#432)\n- Fixed bug in internal function `itisdf()` to give back an empty data.frame \n  when no results found, often with subspecific taxa. Helps solve errors reported\n  in use of `downstream()`, `itis_downstream()`, and `gethierarchydownfromtsn()` (#459)\n\n## NEW FEATURES\n- `gnr_resolve()` gains new parameter `with_canonical_ranks` (logical) to choose\n  whether infraspecific ranks are returned or not. \n- New function `iucn_id()` to get the IUCN ID for a taxon from it's name. (#431)\n\n## DEFUNCT\n- All functions that interacted with the taxonomy service uBio are now \n  defunct. Of course we would deprecate first, then make defunct later, to\n  make transition easier, but that is out of our hands. The functions \n  that are defunct are: `ubio_classification()`, `ubio_classification_search()`, \n  `ubio_id()`, `ubio_search()`, `ubio_synonyms()`, `get_ubioid()`, `ubio_ping()`. \n  In addition, ubio has been removed as an option in the `synonyms()` function,\n  and references for uBio have been removed from the `taxize_cite()` utility\n  function.
