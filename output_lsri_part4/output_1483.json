Check and make sure these are installed on your systems.\n\nGo to a directory where ISOWN will be stored.  Clone ISOWN from GitHub and then set ISOWN environment variable to point to where ISWON is\n```s\ngit clone https://github.com/ikalatskaya/ISOWN\n\ncd ISOWN\n\nISOWN_HOME=`pwd`\n```\n\nFollow instructions on how to install ISOWN dependencies from [here](https://github.com/ikalatskaya/ISOWN/blob/master/DEPENDENCIES.md).

Create a test directory in ISOWN to store out output files.\n\n```$ \nmkdir ${ISOWN_HOME}/test; cd  ${ISOWN_HOME}/test\n```\n\nStep 1. Annotate VCF files with ANNOVAR, PolyPhen, Mutation Assessor, sequence content, dbSNP, COSMIC, and ExAC using the following script \n```$\nperl ${ISOWN_HOME}/bin/database_annotation.pl [ INPUT_FILE ] [ OUTPUT_FILE ]\n```\n\nwhere\n\n    INPUT_FILE is the input file in VCF format.\n  \n    OUTPUT_FILE is the output file in VCF format with annotations from ANNOVAR, PolyPhen, Mutation Assessor, etc.\n\n\nFor example, to annotate test VCF files in ${ISOWN_HOME}/test_data, do the following: \n\n```$\nfor i in `ls ${ISOWN_HOME}/test_data/*vcf`; do perl ${ISOWN_HOME}/bin/database_annotation.pl $i `basename $i` ; done\n```\n\nStep 2: Skip this step if using training data set provided.  This step describe how to generate training data sets based on user data.\nIf a subset of the samples have matching normals then they can be used to train ISOWN. To generate a training data set, variants in the VCF files should be annotated with either \u2018SOMATIC\u2019 or \u2018GERMLINE in the INFO column. We recommend users to use only those variants that they strongly believe are true calls  to generate the training data set.  Some pre-processing such as filtering for passed filtered and some minimum read depth are necessary. To generate a training data set, run the following commands:\n\n```$\nperl ${ISOWN_HOME}/bin/generate_training_data_set.pl  [ INPUT_DIR ] [ OUTPUT_TRAINING_FILE ]\n```\nwhere\n\n    INPUT_DIR is the directory contained the annotated VCF files\n    \n    OUTPUT_TRAINING_FILE is the output training file\n\n\nFor example, to generate a training data set file called \u2018training_data.arff\u2019  from all VCF files current directory:\n```$\nperl ${ISOWN_HOME}/bin/generate_training_data_set.pl ./ training_data.arff\n```\n\nStep 3: Reformat annotated VCF files into .emaf (extended MAF) and run the prediction using the following command:\n```$\nperl ${ISOWN_HOME}/bin/run_isown.pl [ INPUT_DIR ] [ OUTPUT_FILE ] [ ADDITIONAL_ARGUMENTS ] \n```\nwhere\n\n    INPUT_DIR is the absolute path of the folder that contained the annotated VCF files\n\n    OUTPUT_FILE is the output predicted file name\n\n    ADDITIONAL_ARGUMENTS is the string contained additional arguments to be used by classifier\n\n\nFor example, to reformat and run classifier in current directory with BRCA_TrainSet_100.arff data provided:\n```$\nperl ${ISOWN_HOME}/bin/run_isown.pl ./ test.output.txt \" -trainingSet ${ISOWN_HOME}/training_data/BRCA_100_TrainSet.arff -sanityCheck false -classifier nbc\"\n```\n\nwhere\n\n   trainingSet PATH is the path to where the training file in ARFF format.  There are six training sets generated based on 100 randomly selected samples from BRCA, ESCA, KIRC, ESCA, COAD and UCEC that are in ${ISOWN_HOME}/training_data\n   \n   sanityCheck step is justified in the paper and represents a filtering of all predicted somatic mutations with sample frequency > 10%. Not applicable for single samples.  \n\n   Classifier is by default NBC, user can change it to LADTree. Recommended for pancreatic datasets (and maybe other low mutational frequency cancer sets).\n\n"
