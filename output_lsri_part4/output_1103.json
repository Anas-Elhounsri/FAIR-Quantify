It has different thresholding, normalization\nand visualization options. It also allows\nto select areas of the tissue to obtain gene patterns\nto later do DEA or spot classification using machine learning.  \nThe ST viewer uses the data generated with the ST Pipeline \nhttps://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_pipeline, \nwhich consist of a matrix of counts in TSV format where genes are \ncolumns and spot coordinates are rows in the fllowing form:  \nThe ST viewer also requires a tissue HE image and an optional 3x3 alignment matrix (to convert\narray coordinates to image pixel coordinates). \nIf the HE image is cropped to the array boundaries then no alignment matrix is needed. \nThe ST viewer allows to pass a spot coordinates file to correct the coordinates\npositions and/or to only show the spots under the tissue. This file is compatible\nwith the output format of the ST Spot Detector https://github.com/SpatialTranscriptomicsResearch/st_spot_detector \nYou can use our public datasets hosted in http://www.spatialtranscriptomicsresearch.org/\nif you want to try the ST Viewer.\n \n"
