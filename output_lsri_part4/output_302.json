We have developed Coinfinder, a software program that assesses whether sets of homologous genes (gene families) in pangenomes associate or dissociate with each other (i.e. are \u2018coincident\u2019) more often than would be expected by chance. Coinfinder employs a user-supplied phylogenetic tree in order to assess the lineage-dependence (i.e. the phylogenetic distribution) of each accessory gene, allowing Coinfinder to focus on coincident gene pairs whose joint presence is not simply because they happened to appear in the same clade, but rather that they tend to appear together more often than expected across the phylogeny.

The gene information can be provided in one of two formats: (a) as the `gene_presence_absence.csv` output from <a href=\"https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/\">Roary</a>; (b) as a tab-delimited list of genes present in each strain. An example of a tab-delimited list of genes:\n\n```\ngene_1\tgenome_1\ngene_1\tgenome_2\ngene_1\tgenome_3\ngene_2\tgenome_2\ngene_2\tgenome_3\ngene_3\tgenome_1\ngene_3\tgenome_2\n```\n\nNote: the `gene_presence_absence.csv` output from Panaroo appears to differ from Roary in that fields are not surrounded by double-quotes. Coinfinder assumes this double-quote format; you could use something like the following to correct for this:\n\n```\nsed -e 's/^/\"/g' -e 's/$/\"/g' -e 's/,/\",\"/g' gene_presence_absence.csv > gene_presence_absence-withquotes.csv\n```\n\nThe phylogeny should be Newick-formatted with no zero-length branches. We suggest that this phylogeny be constructed using the core gene information (for example, as suggested in the Roary pipeline https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/).\n\nLastly, the user must decide between running Coinfinder to find associations (gene pairs present together) or dissociations (gene pairs which are present apart, or avoid each other).\n\nFor more information on usage, please see `coinfinder -h`:\n\n```\nFile input- specify either: \n    -i or --input          The path to the gene_presence_absence.csv output from Roary\n                           -or-\n                           The path of the Alpha-to-Beta file with (alpha)(TAB)(beta)\n    -I or --inputroary     Set if -i is in the gene_presence_absence.csv format from Roary\n    -p or --phylogeny      Phylogeny of Betas in Newick format (required)\nMax mode (mandatory for coincidence analysis):\n    -a or --associate      Overlap; identify groups that tend to associate/co-occur.\n    -d or --dissociate     Separation; identify groups that tend to dissociate/avoid.\nSignificance- specify: \n    -L or --level          Specify the significnace level cutoff (default: 0.05)\nSignificance correction- specify: \n    -m or --bonferroni     Bonferroni correction multiple correction (recommeneded)\n    -n or --nocorrection   No correction, use value as-is\n    -c or --fraction       (Connectivity analysis only) Use fraction rather than p-value\nAlternative hypothesis- specify: \n    -g or --greater        Greater (recommended)\n    -l or --less           Less\n    -t or --twotailed      Two-tailed\nMiscellaneous:\n    -x or --num_cores      The number of cores to use (default: 2)\n    -v or --verbose        Verbose output.\n    -r or --filter         Permit filtering of saturated and low-abundance data.\n    -U or --upfilthreshold Upper filter threshold for high-abundance data filtering (default: 1.0 i.e. any alpha in >=100/% of betas.\n    -F or --filthreshold   Threshold for low-abundance data filtering (default: 0.05 i.e. any alpha in <=5% of betas.\n    -q or --query          The path to a file containing a list of genes to specificcally query, one per line (optional).\n    -T or --test           Runs the test cases and exits.\n    -E or --all            Outputs all results, regardless of significance.\nOutput:\n    -o or --output         The prefix of all output files (default: coincident).\n```\nTo get the version of coinfinder, simply type `coinfinder` without any flag optoins.\n"
