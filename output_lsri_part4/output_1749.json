        "value": "Automated Local Phylogenomic Analyses, or ALPHA, is a python-based application that provides an intuitive user interface for phylogenetic analyses and data visualization. It has four distinct modes that are useful for different types of phylogenetic analysis: RAxML, File Converter, MS Comparison, and D-statistic.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25121486/30996594-93970970-a487-11e7-996a-2cad60f0002b.png\" alt=\"Welcome\" width=\"400\">\n\nRAxML mode gives users a front-end to interact with RAxML (STAMATAKIS 2014a) for Maximum Likelihood based inference of large phylogenetic trees. ALPHA\u2019s RAxML mode allows one to use RAxML to automatically perform sliding window analysis over an inputted alignment. Users are able to select from a plethora of options in performing their analysis, including: window size, window offset, and number of bootstraps. In this mode, users are able to produce a variety of graphs to help understand their genomic alignment and interpret the trees outputted by RAxML. These graph options include: a tree visualization of the top topologies, scatter plot of windows to their topologies, frequency of top topologies, a line graph of windows to the percent of informative sites, and a heat map of the informative sites. RAxML mode also provides support for calculating two statistics based on the trees produced within each window as compared to an overall species tree: Robinson-Foulds distance and the probability of a gene tree given a species tree.\n\nThe file converter in ALPHA provides a user interface for a Biopython AlignIO file converter function. It allows users to convert between twelve popular genome alignment file types. RAxML mode only accepts phylip-sequential format.\nMS Comparison mode allows users to perform an accuracy comparison between a \u201ctruth file\u201d and one or more files in MS format or the results of RAxML mode.\nWith D-statistic mode, users can compute Patterson\u2019s D-statistic for determining introgression in a four taxa alignment. D-statistic mode produces a scatter plot of the value of the D-statistic across sliding windows as well as the value of the D-statistic across the entire alignment.\n"

In the Run RAxML section, the user selects a file in phylip-sequential format and modifies the options within the Standard or Advanced RAxML settings to fit their preferences. \n\nIn standard mode, the window size, window offset, and the number of top topologies to be analyzed can be inputted manually as integers greater than one. The model type can be selected from six popular types. Bootstrapping can also be selected; if it is, the user can input the confidence level and the number of bootstraps to be performed. The user can also choose to root the tree at a specific outgroup in the input file.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25121486/30996603-99bcc0ce-a487-11e7-9346-79d13b717236.png\" alt=\"RAxML-Standard\" width=\"400\">\n\nIn advanced mode, the user can input a custom RAxML command in which the -s and -n flags are handled internally. A rooted or unrooted species tree can also be generated in this mode using a custom RAxML command or by simply clicking Generate, which runs RAxML on the entire alignment.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25121486/30996604-9c1e3744-a487-11e7-86cb-a9a923bd7c12.png\" alt=\"RAxML-Advanced\" width=\"400\">\n\nFor more information regarding RAxML and its commands see the [RAxML manual](https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/resource/download/NewManual.pdf).\n\nAfter running RAxML, the user can enter the Generate Figures section and select any of the following: Top Topologies Tree Visualization, Windows to Top Topologies Scatter Plot, Top Topology Frequency Donut Plot, Windows to Informative Sites Line Graph, Informative Sites Heat Map, the weighted and/or unweighted Robinson-Foulds Distance Scatter Plot, and the Probability of a Gene Tree given the Species Tree Scatter Plot. The user can also specify how many top toplogies they want to analyze and input a species tree file or string in Graph Options.\n\nThe Top Topologies Tree Visualization generates an image containing the most frequently occuring local phylogenies generated by running RAxML on windows of the previously specified size. The visualization also includes the number of times each topology occurs. \n\nThe Windows to Top Topologies Scatter Plot shows the windows at which each local phylogeny occurs and depicts the x-axis as the window number and the y-axis as the topology.\n\nThe Top Topology Frequency Donut Plot is a graph showing the number of times each topology occurs; topologies differing from the top topologies are lumped together and categorized as \u201cOther.\u201d \n\nGenerate the Top Topologies Tree Visualization, Windows to Top Topologies Scatter Plot, and Top Topology Frequency Donut Plot at the same time to ensure that the colors of the topologies correspond with the colors used within the plots.\n\nThe Windows to Informative Sites Line Graph shows how the percent of informative sites differs across each window. Windows are on the x-axis, and the Percent of Informative Sites is on the y-axis. \n\nThe Informative Sites Heat Map depicts the informativeness of each site in the data. If a site is informative, there is a black line. The more informative the site, the thicker the line in the heat map.\n\nThe Robinson-Foulds Distance Scatter Plot depicts the Robinson-Foulds distance between the local phylogeny and the species tree. The user can choose to generate the Weighted Robinson-Foulds Distance Scatter Plot, which takes branch lengths into account, or they can generate both the weighted and unweighted plots by not checking the Weighted option.\n\nThe Probability of A Gene Tree Given the Species Tree Scatter Plot shows the probability of the local phylogeny at a window actually occurring given the inputted species tree.\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25121486/30996682-2de4ebf0-a488-11e7-88fc-dceac9f606b5.png\" alt=\"RAxML-Graph-Options\" width=\"400\">\n"

THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE UPDATED VERY SOON ALONGSIDE AN ACCOMPANYING PAPER DETAILING THE NEW ALGORITHM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE.\n\nALPHA\u2019s generalized D statistic has many different inputs to cover a range of user preferences. This section will go over each input and its usage in both the user interface and command line script.\n\nTo run the command line version of the generalized D statistic cd into the CommandLineFiles directory and use the following command with one\u2019s desired parameters. All possible parameters are listed below along with their default values for the command line script. Note: not all of these parameters can not be called at the same time.\n\npython -c \"from CalculateGeneralizedDStatistic import *; calculate_generalized(alignments, species_tree=None, reticulations=None, outgroup=None, window_size=100000000000, window_offset=100000000000, verbose=False, alpha=0.01, use_inv=False, useDir=False, directory=\"\", statistic=False, save=False,  f=\"DGenStatistic_\", plot=False, meta=False)\"\n\nBelow we go through a description of each parameter and its usage in both the command line and GUI version of ALPHA:\n\nAlignments:\ncommand line - a list of phylip alignment files, example: [\u2018C:/Users/example/ALPHA/exampleFiles/6TaxaExample\u2019, \u2018C:/Users/example/ALPHA/exampleFiles/6TaxaExample2\u2019]\n\tGUI - click the three dots next to the \u201cAlignment\u201d box and select a phylip file, if multiple files are desired click the plus sign below \u201cAlignment\u201d and select another file\n\nSpecies_tree: \n\tCommand line - a newick string with leaf names matching the taxa in the alignment file, example: \u2018((((P1,P2),(P3,P4)),P5),O);\u2019 users can also input the location of a file containing a newick string\n\tGUI - use either the \u201cspecies tree file\u201d or \u201cspecies tree newick\u201d option. The \u201cspecies tree file\u201d option allows a user to input a file containing a newick string. The \u201cspecies tree newick\u201d option allows a user to type their newick string directly into the user interface\n\nReticulations:\n\tCommand line - a list of reticulations to use where each reticulation represents the direction of possible gene flow, example: [(\u2018P2\u2019,\u2019P3\u2019),(\u2018P4\u2019,\u2019P5\u2019)] a statistic generated by this list of reticulations would determine which site patterns would have an increased probability using a species network with gene flow from P2 to P3 and P4 to P5.\n\tGUI - after inputting an alignment file users can select taxa using the drop down menu in the  \u201cReticulations\u201d section. Taxa on the left represent the source of gene flow while the right taxa are the sink. To add more reticulations to the desired statistic click the plus sign and repeat the steps above.\n\nWindow size:\n\tCommand line - an integer denoting the window size to be used when calculating the generalized D statistic with sliding windows\n\tGUI - input the desired window size as an integer in the textbox next to \u201cWindow Size:\u201d. Note that a plot of the windows to their generalized D statistic can be generated easily using the checkbox next to \u201cGenerate Plot\u201d under \u201cOptions\u201d\n\nWindow offset:\n\tCommand line - an integer denoting the offset to be used for performing sliding window analysis, note that using a window offset equal to the window size results in consecutive windows\n\tGUI - input the desired window offset as an integer in the textbox next to \u201cWindow offset:\u201d.  Note that a plot of the windows to their generalized D statistic can be generated easily using the checkbox next to \u201cGenerate Plot\u201d under \u201cOptions\n\nVerbose:\n\tCommand line - a boolean True or False corresponding to using or not using the verbose output, respectively. Verbose mode includes further information like: the counts for each site pattern, the chi-squared statistic used for determining significance and the probability of each site pattern\n\tGUI - after completing a run of the statistic users can toggle between the verbose and the standard output by clicking \u201cView Verbose Output\u201d in the bottom right corner of the interface\n\nAlpha:\n\tCommand line - a decimal value less than 1 corresponding to the significance level used for hypothesis testing, note that this value is defaulted to 0.01 (1% significance level)\n\tGUI - users can specify their significance level using the textbox next to \u201cAlpha:\u201d\n\nUse_inv:\n\tCommand line - a boolean True or False corresponding to using or not using the inverse site patterns in a statistic, note that at higher taxa using site patterns is not recommended\n\tGUI - users can choose to use inverse site patterns using the checkbox next to \u201cUse Inverse\u201d\n\nUse_dir:\n\tCommand line - a boolean True or False corresponding to using an entire directory of fasta or phylip alignments for performing calculating the generalized D statistic. These files are concatenated in order based on the file name. Note that when True this MUST be used with the directory command explained below\n\tGUI - to use an entire directory click the \u201cUse Directory\u201d checkbox then click the three dots next to the \u201cAlignment Directory:\u201d textbox and select the desired directory\n\nDirectory:\n\tCommand line - a string containing the location of the desired directory for more information see use_dir\n\tGUI - see use_dir\n\nStatistic: \n\tCommand line - a string with the file location of a previously saved statistic, meant to be used in conjunction with the save and f commands from a previous run\n\tGUI - click the \u201cLoad Previously Generated Statistic\u201d checkbox then choose the desired statistic file using the three dots next to the \u201cStatistic:\u201d textbox. Note: using a previously saved statistic allows users to not input a species tree, outgroup and reticulations\n\nSave:\n\tCommand line - a boolean True or False corresponding to creating a save file for future runs (see statistic), can be used with the \u201cf\u201d parameter\nGUI - users can specify a save file name and location using the \u201cStatistic Save Location:\u201d textbox. Users can input a file name directly into the textbox to save their statistic in the ALPHA directory or can click the 3 dots and select a folder then add a slash and the desired name of their file. Example: to \u2018C:/Users/example/Desktop\u2019 one would add \u2019/DGenStatistic\u2019 so that the entry in the textbox would be \u2018C:/Users/example/Desktop/DGenStatistic\u2019\n\nf:\n\tCommand line - a string corresponding to the desired filename for a saved statistic, must be used with \u201csave\u201d parameter. Note: if \u201cf\u201d is not used with \u201csave\u201d the statistic is saved as \u201cDGenStatistic.txt\u201d\n\tGUI - see \u201csave\u201d parameter\n\nPlot:\n\tCommand line - a boolean True or False corresponding to creating a matrix formatted output file with columns for the window number, generalized D value and True or False based on its significance. This parameter is meant make it easy for users to parse and plot the results using their preferred software (R, Excel, etc.)\n\tGUI - in order to automatically generate a windows to generalized D value plot click the checkbox next to \u201cGenerate Plot\u201d\n\nMeta:\n\tCommand line - a string corresponding to any metadata that a user may wish to include in their plot formatted output (see \u201cplot\u201d). This parameter must be used with plot\n\tGUI - this feature is not available in the ALPHA GUI.\n\nFinally, if you have already generated and saved a DGEN statistic, simply launch the dgen tool and select an alignment you wish to analyze. Then select the \"Load Previously Generated Statistic\" checkbox along with selecting the statistic file itself at the location it has been saved on your computer. Then set the window size and offset and optionally change the alpha significance cutoff parameter. To see a graphical output of a plot of the generalized D value versus the windows along the alignment, simply check the \"generate plot\" checkbox.\n\n"

When bootstrapping is not chosen these files are named \u201cRAxML_bestTree\u201d, \u201cRAxML_randomTree\u201d, \u201cRAxML_result\u201d, \u201cRAxML_log\u201d, and \u201cRAxML_info\u201d. Each of these files has \u201c.0\u201d, \u201c.1\u201d, \u201c.2\u201d, etc. extensension corresponding to the index of the window that RAxML was run on. All graphs and images are automatically saved into the plots folder under the name of the image.\n\nFor more information regarding the RAxML output files see the [RAxML manual](https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/resource/download/NewManual.pdf).\n "

You can generate a species tree for this by following the steps in the Advanced mode of Run RAxML. It is not necessary that the species tree is rooted.\n- If you select the Weighted option, ALPHA will generate the weighted Robinson-Foulds Distance Scatter Plot. Otherwise, it will generate both the weighted and unweighted graphs.\n\nFor p(GT|ST) Scatter Plot:\n- Input the Input the species tree by selecting a file or inputting a newick string under the Species Tree section.

Users can reduce the total number of sites that are used for the heatmap in order to speed up runs on extremely large files.\n\nOnce you have selected the desired figures to be generated, click the Generate Figures button. \n\nTo resize and manipulate the figures:\n- All figures generated in ALPHA use a Matplotlib output interface, allowing users to customize figures to their liking. Hovering one\u2019s cursor over the icons at the bottom of each figure\u2019s output window provides a short description of each icon\u2019s usage.

This tab also allows users to automatically generate a legend. \n  - The curves tab allows users to select each curve on the plot and alter its label, line style and color. Both the sliders button and plots button can be accessed by the \u201cConfigure Plot\u201d menu at the top of the window; they can be found under \u201cConfigure Subplots\u201d and \u201cConfigure Axis and Curves\u201d respectively. \n\nTo save figures as images:\n- The save button allows users to save and export the figure window to a specified location. This functionality can also be accessed under \u201cSave As\u2026\u201d in the \u201cFile\u201d menu at the top of the output window.\n- All images can be exported to a desired save location, renamed and saved as one of the following file types: pdf, png, jpeg, tiff, svg, eps, rgba, pgf, and ps.\n"
