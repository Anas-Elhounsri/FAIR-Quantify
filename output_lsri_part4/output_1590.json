        "value": "Using `AMAS` inside your Python pipeline gives you much more flexibility in how the input and output are being processed. All the major functions of the command line interface can recreated using `AMAS` as a module. Following installation from [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) use:\n```\npydoc amas.AMAS\n```\nTo access detailed documentation for the classes and functions available. \nYou can import `AMAS` to your script with:\n```python\nfrom amas import AMAS\n```\nThe class used to manipulate alignments in `AMAS` is `MetaAlignment`. This class has to be instantiated with the same, named arguments as on the command line: `in_files`, `data_type`, `in_format`. You also need to supply the number of cores to be used with `cores`. MetaAlignment holds one or multiple alignments and its `in_files` option must be a list, even if only one file is being read.\nBASH3*\nCreating MetaAlignment with multiple files is easy:\nBASH4*\nNow you can call the various methods on your alignments. `.get_summaries()` method will compute summaries for your alignments and produce headers for them as atuple with first element being the header and the second element a list of lists with the statistics:\nBASH5*\nThe header is different for nucleotide and amino acid data. You may choose to skip it and print only the second element of the tuple, that is a list of summary statistics:\nBASH6*\n`.get_parsed_alignments()` returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary is an alignment and where taxa are the keys and sequences are the values. This allows you to, for example, print only taxa names in each alignment or do other manipulation of the sequence data:\nBASH7*\nSimilar to the above example, it is also easy to get translated amino acid alignment as a list of dictionaries (one per input alignment):\nBASH8*  \nTo split alignment use `.get_partitioned(\"your_partitions_file\")` on a `MetaAlignment` with a single input file. `.get_partitioned()` returns a list of dictionaries of dictionaries, with `{ partition_name : { taxon : sequence } }` structure for each partition:\nBASH9*\n`AMAS` uses `.get_partitions(\"your_partitions_file\")` to parse the partition file:\nBASH10* \n`.get_replicate(no_replicates, no_loci)` gives a list of parsed alignments (dictionaries), each a replicate constructed from the specified number of loci:\n```python\nreplicate_sets = multi_meta_aln.get_replicate(2, 2)\n```\nTo concatenate multiple alignments first parse them with `.get_parsed_alignments()`, then pass to `.get_concatenated(your_parsed_alignments)`. This will return a tuple where the first element is the `{ taxon : sequence }` dictionary\nof concatenated alignment and the second element is the partitions dict with `{ name : range }`.\nBASH12*\nRemoving taxa from alignments is very easy:\nBASH13*\nTo print to file or convert among file formats use one of the `.print_format(parsed_alignment)` methods called with a parsed dictionary as an argument. These methods include `.print_fasta()`, `.print_nexus()`, `.print_nexus_int()`, `print_phylip()`, and `.print_phylip_int()`. They return an apporpriately formatted string.\nBASH14* \n"

        "value": "For every `AMAS.py` run on the command line you need to specify action with `concat`, `convert`, `replicate`, `split`, or `summary` for the input to be processed.\nAdditionally, you need to provide three arguments required for all commands. The order in which the arguments are given does not matter:\n\n1) input file name(s) with `-i` (or in long version: `--in-files`),\n\n2) format with `-f` (`--in-format`),\n\n3) and data type with `-d` (`--data-type`). \n\nThe options available for the format are `fasta`, `phylip`, `nexus` (sequential), `phylip-int`, and `nexus-int` (interleaved). Data types are `aa` for protein alignments and `dna` for nucleotide alignments.\n\nFor example:\n```\npython3 AMAS.py concat -i gene1.nex gene2.nex -f nexus -d dna\n```\n\nIf you have many files that you want to input in one run, you can use multiple cores of your computer to process them in parallel. The `summary` command supports `-c` or `--cores` with which you can specify the number of cores to be used:\n\n```\npython3 AMAS.py summary -f phylip -d dna -i *phy -c 12\n```\nIn the above, we specified 12 cores. Note that this won't improve computing time if you're working with only one or very few files. The parallel processing is only used for the file parsing step and calculating alignment summaries.\n\nIn addition to overall alignment summaries, you can also print statistics calculated on a sequence (taxon) by sequence basis. Use `-s` or `--by-taxon` flag to turn it on. `AMAS` in this mode will print out one file with overall alignment summaries and a file with taxon summaries for each input alignment.\n\nIMPORTANT! `AMAS` is fast and powerful, but be careful: it assumes you know what you are doing and will not prevent you overwriting a file. It will, however, print out a warning if this has happened. `AMAS` was also written to work with aligned data and some of the output generated from unaligned sequences won't make sense. Because of computing efficiency `AMAS` by default does not check if input sequences are aligned. You can turn this option on with `-e` or `--check-align`.\n"

You can change the default names for these files with `-p` (`--concat-part`) and `-t` (`--concat-out`), respectively, followed by the desired name. The output format is specified by `-u` (`--out-format`) and can also be any of the following: `fasta`, `phylip`, `nexus` (sequential), `phylip-int`, or `nexus-int` (interleaved).\n\nBelow is a command specifying the concatenated file output format as nexus with `-u nexus`:\n```\npython3 AMAS.py concat -f fasta -d aa -i *fas -u nexus\n```\nAlignments to be concatenated need not have identical sets of taxa before processing: the concatenated alignment will be populated with missing data where a given locus is missing a taxon. However, if every file to be concatenated includes only unique names (for example species name plus sequence name: `D_melanogaster_NW_001845408.1` in one alignment, `D_melanogaster_NW_001848855.1` in other alignment etc.), you will first need to trim those names so that sequences from one taxon have equivalents in all files.   \nIn addition to the name, you can also specify the format of the partitions output file. By default, the format is the following:\n```\nAA = 1-605\nAK = 606-1200\n28S = 1201-1800\n```\nRAxML:\n```\npython3 AMAS.py concat -f phylip -d dna -i *phy --part-format raxml\n```\n```\nDNA, AA = 1-605\nDNA, AK = 606-1200\nDNA, 28S = 1201-1800\n```\nNexus:\n```\npython3 AMAS.py concat -f phylip -d dna -i *phy --part-format nexus\n```\n```\n#NEXUS\nBegin sets;\n    charset AA = 1-605;\n    charset AK = 606-1200;\n    charset 28S = 1201-1800;\nEnd;\n```\nPartitions can also be written by codon positions using the `-n` or `--codons` flag, either for alignments containing first and second or all three positions. In the above example, supplying `-n 123` would result in:\n```\nAA_pos1 = 1-605\\3\nAA_pos2 = 2-605\\3\nAA_pos3 = 3-605\\3\nAK_pos1 = 606-1200\\3\nAK_pos2 = 607-1200\\3\nAK_pos3 = 608-1200\\3\n28S_pos1 = 1201-1800\\3\n28S_pos2 = 1202-1800\\3\n28S_pos3 = 1203-1800\\3\n``` "

For splitting you should only use one input and one partition file at a time. This is an example partition file:\n```\n  AApos1&2  =  1-604\\3, 2-605\\3\n  AApos3  =  3-606\\3\n  28SAutapoInDels=7583, 7584, 7587, 7593\n```\nIf this was the `partitions.txt` file from the example command above, `AMAS` would write three output files called `concat_AApos1&2.nex`, `concat_AApos3.nex`, and `concat_28SautapoInDels.nex`. The partitions file will be parsed correctly as long as there is no text prior to the partition name (`CHARSET AApos1&2` or `DNA, AApos1&2` will not work) and commas separate ranges or individual sites in each partition.\n\nSometimes after splitting you will have alignments with taxa that have only gaps `-` or missing data `?`. If you want to these to not be included in the output , add `-j` or `--remove-empty` to the command line.   \n"

When translating, `AMAS` will contract gaps `-` and missing `?`, such that `---` becomes `-` in the translated alignment. A warning will be printed if stop codons are found and these are indicated as asterisks `*` in the output. See `AMAS.py translate -h` for more info.\n"

The argument `-x` (the same as `--taxa-to-remove`) is followed by the names of sequences to be removed. Note that `AMAS` converts spaces into underscores and strips any quotes present in input sequence names before processing, so you may need to modify your names to remove accordingly. The argument `-g` (the same as `--out-prefix`) specifies a prefix to be added to output file names. The default prefix is 'reduced_'. You may want to realign your files after taxon removal.\n  "
