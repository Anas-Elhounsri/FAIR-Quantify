It achieves higher accuracy than many other packages, and runs faster by utilizing multi-core architectures to parallelize the processing of these large data sets.\n\nIn contrast to other published methods, readDepth does not require the sequencing of a reference sample, and uses a robust statistical model that accounts for overdispersed data. It includes a method for effectively increasing the resolution obtained from low-coverage experiments by utilizing breakpoint information from paired end sequencing to do positional refinement. It can also be used to infer copy number using reads obtained from bisulfite sequencing experiments.\n\nFor a full description of the method and applications, see:\n\nMiller, CA, et al.

        "value": "- I have paired end data and would like to refine segment edges based on breakpoints called from my data. How do I generate the breakpoints.dat file referred to in the documentation? \nThe breakpoints.dat file is a simple 3-column bed file, listing the locations of breakpoints. readDepth does not call breakpoints - for that, you'll have to use another tool. One I use frequently is BreakDancer, but there are others as well. \n- Can you provide annotation files for #bp read lengths on genome build ##? \nIf your avg read length is within a few base pairs of one of the existing annotation sets, you can just use that - the differences will be minor. If your data is wildly different, then check out the Annotations page for instructions and scripts that will help you create your own. \n- How do I generate my own annotation files, perhaps for non-human genomes? \nCheck out the Annotations section above for more info on this. In short, the mapability files are created by creating all possible reads from the genome, then mapping them back using BWA. This information is then used to calculate the mapability and GC content of all mapable reads in 100 bp windows. Each read's position is specified by it's left-most base. \n- For mate-pair or paired-end data, should I use both ends of these reads? \nSince the positions of the two ends is dependent (except in the case of sv), adding the second read doesn't really give you much information. I recommend only using one end of paired reads (along with any singlet reads). \nThe segs.dat file contains segmented copy number calls for all regions of the genome. The alts.dat file contains the subset of those segments that exceed the gain and loss thresholds. Also take note of the next item: \nIn the alts.dat file, readDepth currently outputs all segments that differ from an expected ploidy of two. It's easy enough to filter this data post-hoc. We plan to handle this more intelligently in the future. \n- I'm not happy with the resolution of my output segments. Is there any way to get higher resolution? \nThe easiest way to do that would be to change the FDR setting in the params file. If you're willing to tolerate a higher false discovery rate, you can get smaller bins. The default is usually 0.01, try 0.05. \nThe other thing you should probably do is check the pdfs in your output directory (assuming you set verbose to TRUE). They give an indication of how well the model fits the data. (dark bars = model, white bars = data). If you're finding that your data has less than the default 3x overdispersion, you may be able to lower the overdispersion parameter. This should also increase resolution. \n- Can I use readDepth for exome data? \nNo. [This answer explains why](https://www.biostars.org/p/17820/#17844). In a nutshell, exome sequencing is heavily biased by the capture process and different probe affinities. A tool like VarScan2? can use a pair of matched arrays (i.e. tumor and normal) processed at the same time to do CN calls from capture data, but with sufficiently less resolution and accuracy. The bottom line is that if you want to do CN-calling, you really need whole-genome sequencing. \nYes, you can use this package on mouse. Look at the instructions given in the Annotations section, including a link to scripts for creating your own annotations. \nAbsolute copy Number call is the estimate of the number of copies at that position (as opposed to the log2 ratio). A copy-number neutral region in a diploid organism (like human) will have a value of 2. \nIn the segmented output, the number of bins is the number of consecutive bins that were merged into a given segment. \n- Can readDepth report the exact breakpoints?What are the columns of star and stop.Can I think they are positions of breakpoints? \nSince this is a windowed depth based approached, the breakpoints will not be precise. CN data can be integrated with exact breakpoint calls from software such as breakdancer, using the rd.matchBreakpoints() function. \n- What should the entrypoints file contain?\nThe entrypoints file is a tab-delimited file with each chromosome name, it's length, and it's ploidy. An example file for hg19 human male is in the [annotations folder](https://wustl.app.box.com/s/yimsngan0v1rc4vsa1b3uhe4ek30rlp8), named `entrypoints.hg19.male`.\n \n"
