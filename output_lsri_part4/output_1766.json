These distributions can be obtained by calling **DetermineThresholdDistributions.m** with the following inputs:\n1. An m by n matrix (not cell array!) containing m genes (rows) with n samples (columns) each. This matrix contains the RNA-Seq measurements based on which the threshold distributions are determined. The datasets in the *DataAccess.txt* could be used for human RNA-Seq and microarray data.\n2. The number of bootstrap samples to be drawn to approximate the parameter distributions of the probability distribution. We empirically determined that 1000 bootstrap samples were enough to obtain close-to-normal parameter distributions but a lower number may be acceptable here.\n3. The precision of the thresholds. Since RefBool is based on samples of the real, unknown gene expression distribution, the thresholds can only be determined up to a certain precision. A value of *10^(-x)* indicates a precision up to the *x*-th decimal place. Here, we recommend to use 10^(-3) to avoid spurious results.\n4. A goodness of fit criterion based on which the best fitting distribution is determined (as character). One of\n\t- **NLogL** - Negative log likelihood (not recommended)\n\t- **BIC** - Bayesian information criterion\n\t- **AIC** - Akaike information criterion\n\t- **AICc** - AIC with correction for finite samples sizes\n5. A boolean value indicating whether to choose the maximum (TRUE) or minimum (FALSE) observed gene expression value if no extreme point is detected for the lower threshold. This option might be removed in a future update, since it can be shown that the extreme point is left of the lowest observed value. Thus, **minimum value (FALSE) is strongly recommended!**\n\nRefBool then returns a (m by 1) cell array of lower and upper threshold distributions for further analysis. Importantly, the function does not know of gene IDs and the user has to keep track of them! It is, however, guaranteed that the threshold distributions in row i of the output correspond to gene i in the input. **Note: This step has to be performed only once for each gene and experimental method!**\n"
