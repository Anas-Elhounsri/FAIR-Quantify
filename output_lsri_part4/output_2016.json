It is optimized for analysis of germline\nvariation in small sets of individuals and somatic variation in\ntumor/normal sample pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and scores\nlarge-scale SVs, medium-sized indels and large insertions within a\nsingle efficient workflow. The method is designed for rapid analysis\non standard compute hardware: NA12878 at 50x genomic coverage is\nanalyzed in less than 20 minutes on a 20 core server, and most WGS\ntumor/normal analyses can be completed within 2 hours. Manta combines\npaired and split-read evidence during SV discovery and scoring to\nimprove accuracy, but does not require split-reads or successful\nbreakpoint assemblies to report a variant in cases where there is\nstrong evidence otherwise. It provides scoring models for germline\nvariants in small sets of diploid samples and somatic variants in\nmatched tumor/normal sample pairs. There is experimental support for\nanalysis of unmatched tumor samples as well. Manta accepts input read\nmappings from BAM or CRAM files and reports all SV and indel inferences\nin VCF 4.1 format. See the [user guide][UserGuide] for a full\ndescription of capabilities and limitations. \nMethods and benchmarking details are described in: \nChen, X. *et al.* (2016) Manta: rapid detection of structural variants and\nindels for germline and cancer sequencing applications. *Bioinformatics*,\n32, 1220-1222.

If building from source, then start from\nthe release distributions of the source code, also provided on the\n[releases page][releases]. Cloning/archiving the source\ndirectly from git could result in missing version number entries,\nundesirably stringent build requirements or an unstable development\nversion between releases. Additional build notes for methods developers can\nbe found in the [developer guide][developerGuide].\n\n[releases]:https://github.com/Illumina/manta/releases\n[DeveloperGuide]:../developerGuide/README.md\n\n\n### Prerequisites to build from source\n\n[![Build Status][tcistatus]][tcihome]\n\n[tcistatus]:https://travis-ci.org/Illumina/manta.svg?branch=master\n[tcihome]:https://travis-ci.org/Illumina/manta\n\nA C++11 compiler is required. These are the current minimum compiler versions enforced\nby the build system:\n\n* python 2.6+\n* gcc 4.8+ OR clang 3.2+ (OR Visual Studio 2013+, see windows note below)\n* libz (including headers)\n\n### Runtime prerequisites\n\n* python 2.6+\n\n### Operating System Guidelines\n\n##### Linux\n\nManta is known to build and run on the following linux distributions\n(with additional packages as described below):\n\n- Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04\n- CentOS 6, 7\n\n##### OS X\n\nManta builds and passes basic tests on OS X 10.9, but full WGS analyses\nare not tested for this platform.\n\n##### Windows\n\nManta does not build or run on windows. Library-level compilation is\npossible for Visual Studio users. See the [developer guide][DeveloperGuide] for details.\n\n### Linux Package Additions\n\n##### Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04\n\n    apt-get update -qq\n    apt-get install -qq bzip2 gcc g++ make python zlib1g-dev\n\n##### Ubuntu 12.04\n\n    apt-get update -qq\n    apt-get install -qq bzip2 gcc g++ make python python-software-properties zlib1g-dev\n    # add gcc 4.8 from ubuntu ppa:\n    add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\n    apt-get update -qq\n    apt-get install -qq gcc-4.8 g++-4.8\n\n    # Prior to build configuration, set CC/CXX to gcc 4.8:\n    export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.8\n    export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.8\n\n##### CentOS 7\n\n    yum install -y tar bzip2 make gcc gcc-c++ libstdc++-static zlib-devel\n\n##### CentOS 6\n\n    yum install -y tar wget bzip2 make gcc gcc-c++ zlib-devel\n\n    # Add gcc 4.9 from developer tools v3:\n    yum install -y centos-release-scl\n    yum install -y devtoolset-3-gcc devtoolset-3-gcc-c++\n\n    # Prior to build configuration, set CC/CXX to gcc 4.9:\n    export CC=/opt/rh/devtoolset-3/root/usr/bin/gcc\n    export CXX=/opt/rh/devtoolset-3/root/usr/bin/g++\n\n### Build procedure\n\nAfter acquiring a release distribution of the source code, the build\nprocedure is:\n\n* Unpack source code\n* Create and move to a separate `build` directory (out-of-source build is required.)\n* Configure build\n* Compile & Install\n\nExample (building on 4 cores):\n\n    wget https://github.com/Illumina/manta/releases/download/v${MANTA_VERSION}/manta-${MANTA_VERSION}.release_src.tar.bz2\n    tar -xjf manta-${MANTA_VERSION}.release_src.tar.bz2\n    mkdir build && cd build\n    # Ensure that CC and CXX are updated to target compiler if needed, e.g.:\n    #     export CC=/path/to/cc\n    #     export CXX=/path/to/c++\n    ../manta-${MANTA_VERSION}.release_src/configure --jobs=4 --prefix=/path/to/install\n    make -j4 install\n\nNote that there are two other dependencies: cmake and boost. These are different than the requirements discussed\nabove, in that they can optionally be provided by the user. They will automatically be built from source if not\ndetected. The minimum required versions of these tools for users planning to provide them to the build process are\n\n* cmake 2.8.12+\n* boost 1.58.0+ (must include static libraries)\n\n...the build process will find an existing cmake version on the user's `PATH` and an existing boost installation\nindicated by the environment variable `BOOST_ROOT`.\n\nIf not detected, then versions of cmake and boost will be built from source and installed to temporary locations under\nthe build directory automatically. This step can make installation more convenient, but does increase the time\nrequiered for configuration. To accelerate this process the configuration step can be parallelized over multiple cores,\nas demonstrated in the example above with the`--jobs=4` argument to configure.\n\nTo see more configure options, run:\n\n    ${MANTA_SRC_PATH}/configure --help\n\n##### Workflow relocation\n\nAfter Manta is built the installation directory can be relocated to\nanother directory.  All internal paths used in the workflow are\nrelative.\n\n### Demo\n\nTo help verify a successful installation, Manta includes a small demo\ndata set and test script. After completing the installation steps\nabove, the demo can be run as follows:\n\n    python ${MANTA_INSTALL_PATH}/bin/runMantaWorkflowDemo.py\n\nThis script creates a `MantaDemoAnalysis` directory under the current\nworking directory, runs Manta on a small demo dataset, and compares the\nsomatic structural variant output to an expected result.\n\nSee [the demo README](../../src/demo/README.md) for additional information\non the test script and data.\n\n"

This slightly improves average runtime and reduces runtime variability. With this update, support for job distribution over SGE is dropped.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Add configuration option to turn off the evidence signal filter during candidate generation (DRAGEN-1873)\r\n  - This enables very high sensitivity during high depth tumor-only calling\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Change the SV candidate discovery and genotyping phase from a multi-process to a multi-thread design for better CPU utilization (MANTA-1521)\r\n  - As a result, runtime is faster and less variable than before.\r\n  - Runtime improvements vary by workload and server configuration, for typical WGS workloads on a modern server an improvement of ~5-10% may be expected, but improvements of up to 50% have been observed for cases where work previously was poorly distributed across processes.\r\n  - SGE support is removed with this change.\r\n- Update htslib/samtools to 1.9 (MANTA-1483)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**manta-1.6.0.centos6_x86_64.tar.bz2** is a binary distribution for 64-bit linux.

VCF representation is improved by introducing a couple of new filters and representing inversions as two breakend records.\r\n\r\n_**Please note the changed format of inversions in the output VCF files.** A supplementary script is provided that can be applied to Manta's output VCF files to reformat inversions into single inverted sequence junctions, which was the format used in earlier versions than this release. The details are described in the section \"Inversions\" of the Developer Guide._\r\nhttps://github.com/Illumina/manta/tree/master/docs/userGuide#inversions\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Add a configurable option to allow overlapping pairs to be used as evidence (MANTA-1398)\r\n  - The option is available in the configure file configureManta.py.ini\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Change SV candidate contig aligners to improve precision (MANTA-1396)\r\n  - Change contig aligners such that variant occurrences are more heavily penalized.\r\n- Fix multi-junction nomination (MANTA-1430)\r\n  - Complex events with more than two junctions are no longer nominated as a group\r\n  - Fix the problem of duplicate detection of the same SV candidate\r\n- Add index to ensure uniqueness of evidence bam filenames (MANTA-1431)\r\n  - It solves the potential problem of name conflicts for evidence bams if the input bam files have the same name while located in different directories.\r\n- Change filters for easy interpretation of multi-sample germline variant vcf (MANTA-1343)\r\n  - Add record-level filter 'SampleFT' when no sample passes all sample level filters\r\n  - Add sample-level filter 'HomRef' for homogyzous reference calls\r\n  - No more sample-level filter will be applied at the record level even if it applies to all samples\r\n- Change representation of inversions in the VCF output (MANTA-1385)\r\n  - Intrachromosomal translocations with inverted breakpoints are now reported as two breakend (BND) records.\r\n  - Previously they were reported in the VCF using the inversion (INV) allele type.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fix the bug of stats generation with short reference sequences (MANTA-1459/[#143])\r\n- Fix the evidence significance test in the multi-sample calling mode (MANTA-1294)\r\n  - This issue previously caused spurious false negatives during the multi-sample calling mode.

It features improvements to candidate SV precision and genotyping accuracy, in addition to minor improvements in stability, runtime and error diagnostics.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Change depth estimation read filter to better match the filter used for variant calling (MANTA-1296)\r\n  - Expected depth per chromosome and local depth per locus/variant are now computed after removing filtered, pcr-duplicate, and secondary reads.\r\n- Lower default memory requirements for scatter phase tasks (MANTA-1307)\r\n  - Reduce from 2Gb to 1.5Gb to enable all cores by default on AWS c4.8xlarge/other c\\* servers.\r\n  - Added new `--callMemMb` option to override this value for cases of extreme depth/chimera rate, etc\r\n- Update htslib/samtools to 1.6 (MANTA-1331)\r\n  - Updated from older 1.2 version to include improved checks on corrupted data.\r\n  - Stopped vendoring zlib as part of this update, so zlib (w/ headers) is now a build requirement.\r\n- Update the genotyping model (MANTA-1205)\r\n  - Allow minor evidence of reference allele for hom-alt calls to tolerate a small number of noisy reads.\r\n  - Filter out split reads with poor alignments to both alleles.\r\n- Change the eligibility filter of split reads to only consider the most likely allele (MANTA-1332)\r\n  - A split read is allowed to contribute to the split-read evidence if its alignment to the most like allele passes the eligibility filter.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Provide clear error message when attempting to configure/run with python3 (MANTA-1285)\r\n- Improve error message/docs for alignment records with unknown sequence (SEQ='\\*') (MANTA-1295/[#111])\r\n- Improve error message when two alignments use the same QNAME/read-number (MANTA-1293)\r\n  - Message changed to help end-users track down the issue in the alignment file more easily - now includes chromosome name instead of contig index and 1-indexed alignment position.\r\n- Fix CRC error from python gzip lib when generating evidence bam (MANTA-1270)\r\n  - Remove the filter on evidence reads for SV candidates that are not in the file candidateSV.vcf.gz, because the file now contains all SV candidates without removing duplicates.\r\n- Stop automatically clearing python environment variables (MANTA-1316)\r\n  - This should allow python from certain module systems to be used, but may (rarely) cause instability due to conflicting content in a user's PYTHONPATH.\r\n- Improve estimation of chimeric fragment rate (ie. fraction of reads which are split or in anomalous pairs) (MANTA-1261/[#103])\r\n  - This fraction is used to set signal/noise thresholds important for somatic calling.\r\n  - The secondary/supplemental segments of each split read are no longer counted as separate observations.\r\n  - The method now accounts for many reads being classified as both anomalous and split.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**manta-1.3.0.centos6_x86_64.tar.bz2** is a binary distribution for 64-bit linux.

        "description": "### Summary\n\nThis is a major update introducing joint analysis of multiple diploid individuals.\n\nWhen provided with multiple input BAM files, Manta now builds a joint candidate SV and indel set over all samples, then analyzes supporting evidence to provide genotypes for each individual, outputting all results in a multi-sample VCF. The diploid analysis VCF output now includes PL values and per-sample filtration, and should be appropriate for post-processing to provide _de-novo_ variant call candidates. Note that the initial target for multi-sample support is on the family scale, so behavior and stability of the method for joint analysis of more than about 10 samples is unknown. Previous manta users should consult update risks enumerated further below.\n\n### Changelog since v0.27.2:\n- MANTA-259 Support joint analysis of multiple diploid samples\n- MANTA-260 Add per-sample filtration to separate QUAL and GQ filters for\n  diploid case\n- MANTA-252 Add fast chrom median depth estimator (partally enables CRAM)\n- MANTA-258 Add PL values to diploid output\n\n### Update risks\n\nThis update brings a number of minor sample processing changes which are potentially disruptive for users of older versions:\n- Previously multiple BAM files were accepted for each sample and merged as a single sample (for either the normal or tumor sample). This 'merging workflow' is no longer an option.\n- Sample names printed in the VCF output are now parsed from the header of each input BAM file. The name is parsed from the first `@RG` record found which contains a sample name, and processed to replace spaces with underscores. This replaces the previous use of \"SAMPLE\" for germline and tumor-only analysis and the use of \"NORMAL\" and \"TUMOR\" for tumor/normal subtraction.\n- The diploid VCF output now uses `SAMPLE`-level filtration (the `FT` field from the VCF 4.1 spec). There is a new record-level filter on `QUAL` < 20 (called \"MinQUAL\"), and the previous \"MinGQ\" filter is now a sample filter. All other manta record-level filters are still applied at the whole-record level. Note that to simplify the transition for users who are only interested in single individual analysis, any sample filter which is applied to all samples in the VCF is copied to the record level as well.\n\n---\n\n**manta-0.28.0.centos5_x86_64.tar.bz2** is a binary distribution for 64-bit linux.

This update also includes important RNA-Seq analysis fixes.\n\nFull ChangeLog since v0.27.1:\n- MANTA-257 Fix rare failure condition for graph merge\n- MANTA-255 include zlib in build, simplify win64 development\n- MANTA-254 Fix handling of off-edge splicing in the RNA Jump Intron Aligner\n- MANTA-253 improve alignment corner cases and debugging features\n\n---\n\n**manta-0.27.2.centos5_x86_64.tar.bz2** is a binary distribution for 64-bit linux. This is built on CentOS 5 with all dependencies except glibc statically linked. It is expected to run without modification on most linux distributions.\n\nThe **manta-0.27.2.release_src.tar.bz2** download is the full source code release. The \u201cSource code\u201d downloads are generated by GitHub and are incomplete as they are missing version numbers and build system changes to improve portability.\n",

        "description": "This release includes an important stability fix [#6]. This fix closes a bug which can deterministically fail certain builds based on the structure of manta's region association graph. It should be somewhat more likely to cause problems in highly rearranged genomes. Thanks to @lawrencebower for identifying and providing examples to reproduce this.\n\nChangelog:\n- [#6] Fix assertion caused by filtered graph edges on bin boundaries.\n- [#5] Improve robustness to filesystem delay (update ot pyflow v1.1.7)\n\n---\n\n**manta-0.27.1.centos5_x86_64.tar.bz2** is a binary distribution for 64-bit linux.
