        "value": "This repository contains tools for dealing with Unique Molecular\nIdentifiers (UMIs)/Random Molecular Tags (RMTs) and single cell\nRNA-Seq cell barcodes. Currently there are 6\ncommands.  \nThe ``extract`` and ``whitelist`` commands are used to prepare a\nfastq containg UMIs +/- cell barcodes for alignment.  \n* whitelist:\n   **Builds a whitelist of the 'real' cell barcodes**\n      This is useful for droplet-based single cell RNA-Seq where the\n      identity of the true cell barcodes is unknown. Whitelist can\n      then be used to filter with extract (see below) \n* extract:\n   **Flexible removal of UMI sequences from fastq reads.**\n      UMIs are removed and appended to the read name. Any other\n      barcode, for example a library barcode, is left on the read. Can\n      also filter reads by quality or against a whitelist (see above) \nThe remaining commands, ``group``, ``dedup`` and ``count``/``count_tab``, are used to\nidentify PCR duplicates using the UMIs and perform different levels of\nanalysis depending on the needs of the user. A number of different UMI\ndeduplication schemes are enabled - The recommended method is\n*directional*. \n* dedup:\n   **Groups PCR duplicates and deduplicates reads to yield one read per group**\n      Use this when you want to remove the PCR duplicates prior to any\n      downstream analysis \n* group: \n   **Groups PCR duplicates using the same methods available through `dedup`.**\n      This is useful when you want to manually interrogate the PCR duplicates\n   \n* count:\n   **Groups and deduplicates PCR duplicates and counts the unique molecules per gene**\n      Use this when you want to obtain a matrix with unique molecules\n      per gene, per cell, for scRNA-Seq. \n* count_tab:\n   **As per count except input is a flatfile** \nIf you want to use UMI-tools in single-cell RNA-Seq data processing,\nsee `Single_cell_tutorial.md <./doc/Single_cell_tutorial.md>`_ \n**Important update**: We now recommend the use of `alevin` for droplet-based\nscRNA-Seq (e.g 10X, inDrop etc). `alevin` is an accurate, fast and convenient end-to-end tool to go from fastq -> count matrix and  extends the UMI error correction in `UMI-tools` within a framework that also enables quantification of droplet scRNA-Seq without discarding multi-mapped reads.  See `alevin documentation <https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/alevin.html>`_ and `alevin pre-print <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/335000v2>`_ for more information \nThe ``dedup``, ``group``, and ``count`` / ``count_tab`` commands make use of network-based methods to resolve similar UMIs with the same alignment coordinates.

        "description": "## UMI-tools output is now deterministic with `--random-seed`\r\nMany users have had issues with making UMI-tools deterministic, which previously relied upon both `--random-seed` and the enivornmental variable `PYTHONHASHSEED` being set. From `v1.1.6` only `--random seed` is required. \r\n\r\nPlease note that in some cases the implemented solution may make the output from v.1.1.6 different to previous versions, even if `--random-seed` is set to the same value. The differences will be very slight and the different outputs represent equally sensible UMI grouping/deduplication since they relate only to how ties are broken.\r\n\r\nThank you @TyberiusPrime,  @christianbioinf and others for their suggestions for how to remove the dependency on `PYTHONHASHSEED` for deterministic output. \r\n\r\n## New features\r\n* umi_tools is now deterministic when using --random-seed - @TomSmithCGAT in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/550\r\n* Option to extract barcode from read2 only -  @TomSmithCGAT in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/630\r\n* Adds support for python 3.12 - @IanSudbery in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/657\r\n\r\n## Bugfix\r\n* Avoids switching matplotlib backend - @sshen8 in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/640\r\n* count_tab now correctly reads UMI and cell barcodes - @eachanjohnson in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/654\r\n* count_tab now writes out strings not bytes - @eachanjohnson in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/654\r\n* Installation with < python 3 prevented - @IanSudbery in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/644\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n* FAQ entry regarding identification of possible duplicates reads/pairs - @TomSmithCGAT in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/631\r\n* Improved docs regarding chimeric/unmapped/unpaired read pairs - @TomSmithCGAT in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/629\r\n\r\n## Other\r\n\r\n* Add issue templates - @TomSmithCGAT in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/632\r\n* Update testing suite to pytest - @eachanjohnson in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/655\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @sshen8 made their first contribution in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/640\r\n* @eachanjohnson made their first contribution in https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/pull/654\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/compare/1.1.5...v1.1.6",

        "description": "A long overdue release covering some minor functionality updates and bugfixes:\r\n\r\n### Additional functionality:\r\n- Write out reads failing regex matching with `extract`/`whitelist` (see options `--filtered-out`, `--filtered-out2`). See #328 for motivation\r\n- Ignore template length with paired-end `dedup`/`group` (see option `--ignore-tlen`). See #357 for motivation. Thanks @skitcattCRUKMI \r\n- Ignore read pair suffixes with `extract`/`whitelist` e.g `/1` or `/2`. (see option `--ignore-read-pair-suffixes`). See #325, #391, #418, PierreBSC/Viral-Track#9 for motivation\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n- Sped up error correction mapping for cell barcodes in `whitelist` by using BKTree. Thanks @redst4r. Note that this adds a new python dependency (`pybktree`) which is available via `pip` and `conda-forge`.\r\n- Very slight reduction in memory usage for `dedup`/`group` via bugfix to reduce the amount of reads being retained in the buffer. Thanks to @mitrinh1 for spotting this (#428). The bug was equivalent to hardcoding the option `-buffer-whole-contig` on, which ensures all reads with the same start position are grouped together for deduplication, but at the cost of not yielding reads until the end of each contig, thus increasing memory usage. As such, the bug was not detrimental to results output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n- Unmapped mates were not properly discarded with `dedup` and `group`.

As part of this release, much of the code base has been refactored. It is possible this may have introduced bugs which have not been picked up by the regression testing. If so, please raise an issue and we'll try and rectify with a minor release update ASAP.\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n\r\nUMI-tools documentation is now available online: https://umi-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\r\n\r\nAlong with the previous documentation, the readthedocs pages also include new pages:\r\n\r\n - FAQ\r\n - Making use of our Alogrithmns: The API\r\n\r\n**New knee method for whitelist**\r\n\r\n - The method to detect the \"knee\" in `whitelist` has been updated (#317). This method should always identify a threshold and is now set as the default method. Note that this knee method appears to be slightly more conservative (fewer cells above threshold) but having identified the knee, one can always re-run `whitelist` and use `--set-cell-number` to expand the whitelist if desired\r\n - The old method is still available via `--knee-method=density`\r\n - In addition, to run the old knee method but allow whitelist to exit without error even if a suitable knee point isn't identified, use the new `--allow-threshold-error` option (#249)\r\n - Putative errors in CBs above the knee can be detected using `--ed-above-threshold` (#309)\r\n\r\n**Explicit options for handling chimeric & inproper read pairs** (#312)\r\n\r\nThe behaviour for chimeric read pairs, inproper read pairs and unmapped reads can now be explictly set with the `--chimeric-pairs`, `--unpaired-reads` and `--unmapped-reads`.\r\n\r\n**New options**\r\n\r\n - `--temp-dir`: Set the directory for temporary files (#254)\r\n - `--either-read` & `--either-read-resolve`: Extract the UMI from either read (#175)\r\n\r\n**Misc**\r\n\r\n - Updates python testing version to 3.6.7 and drops python 2 testing\r\n - Replace deprecated imp import (#318)\r\n - Debug error with `pysam <0.14` (#319)\r\n - Refactor module files\r\n - Moves documentation into dedicated module",

        "description": "Version 0.5.0 introduces new commands to support single-cell RNA-Seq and reduces run-time. The underlying methods have not changed hence the minor release number uptick.\r\n\r\n## UMI-tools goes single cell\r\n\r\nNew commands for single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq):\r\n\r\n* **whitelist** - Extract cell barcodes (CB) from droplet-based scRNA-Seq fastqs and estimate the number of \"true\" \r\nCBs.  Outputs a flatfile listing the true cell barcodes and 'error' barcodes within a set distance. See #97 for a motivating example. Thanks to @Hoohm for input and patience in testing. Thanks to @k3yavi for input in discussions about implementing a 'knee' method.\r\n\r\n* **count** -  Count the number of reads per cell per gene after de-duplication. This tool uses the same underlying methods as `group` and `dedup` and acts to simplify scRNA-Seq read-counting with `umi_tools`. See #114, #131 \r\n\r\n* **count_tab** - As per `count` but works from a flatfile input from e.g `featureCounts` - See #44, #121, #125\r\n\r\nIn the process of creating these commands, the options for dealing with UMIs on a \"per-gene\" basis have been re-jigged to make their purpose clearer. See e.g #127 for a motvating example.\r\n\r\nTo perform `group`, `dedup` or `count` on a per-gene, basis, the `--per-gene` option should be provided. This must be combined with either `--gene-tag` if the BAM contains gene assignments in a tag, or `--per-contig` if the reads have been aligned to a transcriptome. In the later case, if the reads have been aligned to a transcriptome where each contig is a transcript, the option `--gene-transcript-map` can be used to operate at the gene level. These options are standardised across all tools such that one can easily change e.g a `count` command into a `dedup` command.\r\n\r\nUpdated options:\r\n\r\n* **extract** - Can now accept regex patterns to describe UMI +/- CB encoding in read(s). See `--extract-method=regex` option. \r\n\r\nWe have written a guide for how to [use UMI-tools for scRNA-Seq analysis](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools/blob/master/doc/Single_cell_tutorial.md) including estimation of the number of true CBs, flexible extraction of cell barcodes and UMIs and per-cell read-counting as well as common workflow variations.\r\n\r\n## Reduced run-time (#156)\r\nIntroduced a hashing step to limit the scope of the edit-distance comparisons required to build the networks. Big thanks to @mparker2 for this!\r\n\r\n## Simplified installation ( #145 )\r\nPreviously extensions were cythonized and compiled on the fly using 'pyximport, requiring users to have access to the install directory the first time the extension was required. Now the cythonized extension is provided, and is compiled at install-time. ",

        "description": "- Tweaks the way _group_ handles paired end BAMs. To simplify the process and ensure all reads are written out, the paired end read (read 2) is now outputted without a group or UMI tag. (#115). \r\n- Introduces the `--skip-tags-regex` option to enable users to skip descriptive gene tags, such as \"Unassigned\" when using the `--gene-tag` option. See #108.\r\n- Bugfixes:\r\n   - If the --transcript-gene-map included transcripts not observed in the BAM, this caused an error when trying to retrieve reads aligned to the transcript. This has been resolved. See #109 \r\n    - Allow output to zipped file with extract using python 3 #104\r\n- Improved test coverage (`--chrom` and `--gene-tag` options). Thanks @MarinusVL for kindly sharing a BAM with gene tags.    ",

        "description": "**Added functionality:**\r\n\r\n- ***Deduplicating on gene ids*** ( #44 for motivation):\r\nThe user can now _group_/_dedup_ according to the gene which the read aligns to. This is useful for single cell RNA-Seq methods such as e.g CEL-Seq where the position of the read on a transcript may be different for reads generated from the same initial molecule. The following options may be used define the gene_id for each read:\r\n`--per-gene`\r\n`--gene-transcript-map`\r\n`--gene-tag`\r\n\r\n- ***Working with BAM tags*** (#73, #76, #89):\r\nUMIs can now be extracted from the BAM tags and_group_ will add a tag to each read describing the read group and UMI. See following options for controlling this behaviour:\r\n`--extract-umi-method`\r\n`--umi-tag`\r\n`--umi-group-tag`\r\n\r\n- ***Ouput unmapped reads*** (#78)\r\nThe _group_ command will now output unmapped reads if the `--output-unmapped` is supplied. These reads will not be assigned to any group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\+ bug fixes for group command (#67, #81) and updated documentation  (#77, #79 )",
