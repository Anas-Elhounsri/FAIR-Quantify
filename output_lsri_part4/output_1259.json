It is present at `scripts/main.py`.\n   \n   - `<path to workflow file>`: It is a path to a tabular file containing Galaxy workflows. E.g. `data/worflow-connection-20-04.tsv`.\n   \n   - `<path to tool popularity file>`: It is a path to a tabular file containing usage frequencies of Galaxy tools. E.g. `data/tool-popularity-20-04.tsv`.\n   \n   - `<path to trained model file>`: It is a path of the final trained model (`h5` file). E.g. `data/<<file name>>.hdf5`.\n   \n   - `<cutoff date>`: It is used to set the earliest date from which the usage frequencies of tools should be considered. The format of the date is YYYY-MM-DD. This date should be in the past. E.g. `2017-12-01`.\n\n   - `<maximum length of tool path>`: This takes an integer and specifies the maximum size of a tool sequence extracted from any workflow. Any tool sequence of length larger than this number is not included in the dataset for training. E.g. `25`.\n\n   - `<number of training iterations>`: Once the best configuration of hyperparameters has been found, the neural network takes this configuration and runs for \"n_epochs\" number of times minimising the error to produce a model at the end. E.g. `10`.\n\n   - `<number of iterations to optimise hyperparamters>`: This number specifies how many iterations would the neural network executes to evaluate each sampled configuration. E.g. `5`.\n\n   - `<maximum number of evaluation to optimise hyperparameters>`: The hyperparameters of the neural network are tuned using a Bayesian optimisation approach and multiple configurations are sampled from different ranges of parameters. The number specified in this parameter is the number of configurations of hyperparameters evaluated to optimise them. Higher the number, the longer is the running time of the tool. E.g. `20`.\n\n   - `<fraction of test data>`: It specifies the size of the test set. For example, if it is 0.5, then the test set is half of the entire data available. It should not be set to more than 0.5. This set is used for evaluating the precision on an unseen set. E.g. `0.2`.\n\n   - `<range of batch sizes>`:  The training of the neural network is done using batch learning in this work. The training data is divided into equal batches and for each epoch (a training iteration), all batches of data are trained one after another. A higher or lower value can unsettle the training. Therefore, this parameter should be optimised. E.g. `32,256`.\n\n   - `<range of hidden units>`: This number is the number of hidden recurrent units. A higher number means stronger learning (may lead to overfitting) and a lower number means weaker learning (may lead to underfitting). Therefore, this number should be optimised. E.g. `32,512`.\n\n   - `<range of embedding sizes>`: For each tool, a fixed-size vector is learned and this fixed-size is known as the embedding size. This size remains same for all the tools. A lower number may underfit and a higher number may overfit. This parameter should be optimised as well. E.g. `32,512`.\n\n   - `<range of dropout>`: A neural network tends to overfit (especially when it is stronger). Therefore, to avoid or minimize overfitting, dropout is used. The fraction specified by dropout is the fraction of units \"deleted\" randomly from the network to impose randomness which helps in avoiding overfitting. This parameter should be optimised as well. E.g. `0.0,0.5`.\n    \n   - `<range of spatial dropout>`: Similar to dropout, this is used to reduce overfitting in the embedding layer. This parameter should be optimised as well. E.g. `0.0,0.5`.\n\n   - `<range of recurrent dropout>`: Similar to dropout and spatial dropout, this is used to reduce overfitting in the recurrent layers (hidden). This parameter should be optimised as well. E.g. `0.0,0.5`.\n\n   - `<range of learning rates>`: The learning rate specifies the speed of learning. A higher value ensures fast learning (the optimiser may diverge) and a lower value causes slow learning (may not reach the optimum). This parameter should be optimised as well. E.g. `0.0001, 0.1`.\n\n   - `<number of CPUs>`: This takes the number of CPUs to be allocated to parallelise the training of the neural network. E.g. `4`.\n"

In the `galaxy.yml.sample` config file, make the following changes:\n    - Enable and then set the property `enable_tool_recommendations` to `true`. \n3. In order to allow Galaxy admins to add/remove tools from the list of recommendations, the following steps can be used:\n    - A Galaxy config file has been provided (https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/config/tool_recommendations_overwrite.yml.sample) to offer following features and instructions to use these features are given in the file itself:\n        - Enable `admin_tool_recommendations_path` in Galaxy's config file at `config/galaxy.yml.sample`.\n        - Add tool(s) and mark them \"deprecated\".\n        - Add new tool(s) to the list of recommendations.\n        - Overwrite all recommendations (predicted by trained model). (Enable `overwrite_model_recommendations` and set to `true` in Galaxy's config file at `config/galaxy.yml.sample`).\n \n"
