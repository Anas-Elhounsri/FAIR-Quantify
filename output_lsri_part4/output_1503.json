        "description": "### New features\r\n\r\n* Added the `taxonomy_table` function that converts the information in a `taxmap` or `taxonomy` object into a table with taxa as rows and ranks as columns.\r\n* Added the `print_tree` function that prints text-based trees of `taxmap` or `taxonomy` objects ([issue #173](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/173)).\r\n* Added `get_dataset` function to get a single data set from `taxmap` objects. Useful for piping with `%>%`.\r\n* `filter_taxa` and `filter_obs` can now subset anything that has names, length, and can be subset, not just tables, lists, and vectors. For example, `DNAbin` objects from the `ape` package can now be used in `taxmap` objects ([issue #178](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/178)).\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* Parsers are somewhat faster and use less RAM ([issue #177](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/177)).\r\n* `taxmap` and `taxonomy` parsers now treat taxa with the same name and same place in the taxonomy, but different ranks, database IDs, or authorities, as different taxa.\r\n* `filter_obs` can now filter multiple datasets at once if they are the same length ([issue #179](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/179)).\r\n* `select_obs` and `arrange_obs` can now work on multiple datasets at once.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Made the `\"taxon_rank\"` value for the `class_key` options work with `extract_tax_data`. \r\n* Fixed bug in `taxmap` print method when printing tables with only a taxon ID column ([issue #181](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/181)).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* Option `target` in many functions renamed to `data` to make it more intuitive.

        "description": "### Improvements\r\n\r\n* `parse_tax_data` can now incorperate rank information which can be accessed by `result$taxon_ranks()` ([issue #113](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/113)).\r\n* `taxmap` print methods now have more information and color ([issue #124](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/124)).\r\n* Added `leaves_apply` function that works like `subtaxa_apply`, but on leaves ([issue #126](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/126)).\r\n* Functions with a `value` option now return named taxon indexes by default, instead of unnamed taxon indexes ([issue #128](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/128)).\r\n* `lookup_tax_data` and `extract_tax_data` can now use \"fuzzy\" matching when looking up taxon names, so taxon names can be mispelled and still be founds.\r\n* `lookup_tax_data` and `extract_tax_data` now only look up unique sequence IDs, improving download speed.\r\n* `filter_obs` now can filter out observations in non-target data sets that are assocaited with taxa that are removed when `drop_taxa = TRUE` ([issue #143](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/143)). This is done using `filter_taxa`, so the `supertaxa`, `subtaxa`, and `reassign_obs` options are now available to `filter_obs` to control how taxon removal is done.\r\n* `lookup_tax_data` and `extract_tax_data` now have progress bars instead of printing lots of text when downloading information.\r\n* `mutate_obs` now creates new vector/tables if the data set specified does not exist ([issue #121](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/124)).\r\n* Add `filter_taxa` option `keep_order` that preserves input taxon order. It is `TRUE` by default, which changes how it used to work. Set to `FALSE` for old behavior.\r\n* Using NSE with an ambiguous name (appears in multiple datasets) now produces a warning ([issue #153](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/153)).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* The `simplify` option in many functions is now always handled the same way: If all vectors in a list are names, then unique key-value pairs are returned. Otherwise, names are ignored and unique values are returned.\r\n* The `leaves` option now behaves like `subtaxa`, returning all leaves for each taxon. The old behavior can be replicated by setting the new `simplify` option to `TRUE` ([issue #127](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/127)).\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* `filter_taxa` now has better error messages for invalid inputs ([issue #117](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/117)).\r\n* Fix a bug that caused an error in `filter_taxa` when no taxa pass filter ([issue #116](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/116)).\r\n* Fixed a bug in `parse_tax_data` when `class_key` was not named ([issue #131](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/131)).\r\n* Fixed bug in `hierarchy` print method with `taxon_id` class was not used ([issue #138](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/138)).\r\n* Fixed bug in `parse_tax_data` when all classification data is `NA.`\r\n* Fixed bug in `taxmap` print method when printing zero-length lists and vectors ([issue #148](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/148)).\r\n",

        "description": "### Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed a few problems with using duplicated inputs to `subset` ([issue #88](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/85), [issue #89](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/85))\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused an error when using unnamed vectors ([issue #86](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/86))\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevents using sequence accession numbers ([issue #85](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/85))\r\n* Fixed bug in `lookup_tax_data` and `extract_tax_data` that caused an error when one of the queries failed too download.\r\n* Fixed bug that caused \"data\" argument of `obs_apply` to not work when passed as a varaible ([issue #97](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/97))\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n* Added `map_data_` for mapping without using NSE.\r\n* Make default dataset for `n_obs` and `n_obs_1` and make them available for NSE ([issue #91](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/91)\r\n* `parse_tax_data`/`extract_tax_data` can now parse things like `phylum;Nitrosopumilales;order;Nitrosopumilaceae;family;` and split out the rank and taxon names by using multiple matches to the `class_regex` when `class_sep` is NULL. \r\n* `extract_tax_data` now gives warnings if a regex does not match.\r\n* Added `n_supertaxa_1` function to get number of immediate supertaxa (always 1 or 0).\r\n* Added `branches` function to go with `roots`, `leaves`, and `stems`. ([issue #56](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/56))\r\n* Added `internodes` and `is_internode` functions to go with `roots`, `leaves`, `branches`, and `stems`. USeful for removing uninformative taxonomic ranks/taxa.\r\n* Started to incorporate ability for `taxon`, `taxon_name`, `taxon_id`, `taxon_rank`, and `taxa` to handle `NULL` inputs as first class citizens to handle cases when you have essentially a blank taxon (use case comes from `taxize` package) [#95](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/95) [#107](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/107)\r\n* data parsers: Put long, often unused columns last ([issue #93](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/93))\r\n* When parsing classifications that have per-taxon info add input id column ([issue #92](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/92))\r\n* New function `classification` as an abstraction to get either hierarchy of taxon indexes, names, or ids ([issue #57](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/57))\r\n* New function `get_data_frame` for both `Taxonomy` and `Taxmap` objects that wraps around `get_data` to coerce into a `data.frame`. ([issue #58](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/58)) ([PR #105](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa/issues/105))\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n* In the output of the taxmap parsing functions like `parse_tax_data`, I moved \"taxon_id\" and \"input_index\" columns to front and \"input\" to rear. Also \"tax_data\" now comes before \"class_data\".\r\n",
