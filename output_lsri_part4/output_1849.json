        "value": "GenSSI 2.0 - Generating Series for testing Structural Identifiability\r\n\r\nGenSSI 2.0 is a software toolbox for structural identifiability analysis of linear and nonlinear ODE models. It couples the generating series approach with identifiability tableaus (Chi\u015f, et al., 2011a). Using Lie derivatives of the ODE model, a system of equations is generated, the solvability properties of which provide information about global and local structural identifiability as well as non-identifiability (Chi\u015f et al., PLoS ONE, 2011b). The results are provided as text and visualised.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of GenSSI 2.0 is more efficient than that of earlier versions (Chi\u015f et al., Bioinformatics, 2011) and provides the following functionalities:\r\n- An import for the SBML models is provided to facilitate the application of structural identifiability analysis in systems biology. This import exploits functionalities of the MATLAB toolbox SBMLimporter (https://github.com/ICB-DCM/SBMLimporter) and libSBML (Bornstein, et al., 2008).\r\n- Routines for multi-experiment structural identifiability analysis are provided. These routines allow the analysis of structural identifiability if observation under multiple experimental conditions, e.g. different inputs or initial states, are available.\r\n- Routines for state and parameter transformations are implemented to facilitate the removal of non-identifiable parameters and rescaling the variables. To accelerate the symbolic calculations, a routine for the automatic reformulations of ODEs with rational right-hand sides to ODEs with polynomial right-hand sides is provided (Ohtsuka, IEEE Transactions Automatic Control, 2005).\r\n- Routines for structural identifiability analysis and calculation of identifiability tableaus.\r\n- Visualisation routines for identifiability plateaus.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- Chi\u015f, O.-T., Banga, J.R. and Balsa-Canto, E.
