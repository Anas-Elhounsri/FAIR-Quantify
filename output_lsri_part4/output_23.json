If no downsample was carried out, file contains only one line for 100% of reads. In addition to sensitivity mean coverage is provided.\nOutput VCF file copies the input VCF files provided with \"--vcf\" option with INFO section is expanded. Field \"SSS\" is added into INFO section providing information for Single Site Sensitivity for each mutation: \n****************LIMITATIONS OF USAGE**************** \nPlease make sure that:\n-\tEphaGen handle only Single Nucleotide Variation, Multiple Nucleotide Variations (up to 50b.p. long), short insertions and deletions (up to 50b.p. long). Large genomic rearrangements, CNV, exon deletions and insertions are not supported.\n-\tReference VCF files, stored in the /reference directory (for BRCA and CFTR pathogenic mutation analysis) are made based on databases BREAST CANCER INFORMATION CORE and CFTR2. Allele counts taken from these databases refer to general population and may be inappropriate for some populations, especially for minor populations. Moreover, allele frequency spectrum based on these allele counts can possess bias towards overrepresented variations.\n \n"
