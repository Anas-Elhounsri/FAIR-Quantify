It is also possible to download sequence variants using UniprotID - the sequence will be blasted and cutoff value applied. These variants are aligned with MUSCLE. From the resulting multiple sequence alignment, the consensus sequence is constructed by retaining the most frequently found residue across all variant sequences for each position. This residue should be found more than the conservation threshold which is set be the user. Two matrices are created. The first matrix annotates the consensus sequence with the absolute abundance of each amino acid per position. In the second matrix, these numbers are converted into relative abundances in percent. Finally, a sequence logo is created with WebLogo.\n\n**Sequence SNP variants analysis:**\nThe SNP variants analysis is based either on Uniprot and Ensembl data or on DNA sequence(s). In the first case the variant data is downloaded from the Uniprot and Ensembl databases using UniprotID. In the second case user-supplied fasta file with multiple sequences is used or, if using single DNA sequence, sequence is BLASTed against NCBI database with identity cutoff to obtain multiple sequences to be analyzed. Sequences are then aligned and compared to spot SNPs, as well as translated and aligned to obtain consensus protein sequence. In both cases using gathered info a matrix is created, annotating the protein sequence with the frequency, variants and type of variant. Based on that, the sequence is coloured accordingly. \n"
