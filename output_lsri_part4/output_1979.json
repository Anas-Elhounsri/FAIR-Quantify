ABC requires at a minimum two (2) files a sorted BAM/SAM file \nof a ChIP-Seq experiment and a file containing the position, strand and allele information of heterozygous Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), either SNPs and/or Mutations. ABC calls allele-specific \nbinding by identifying a bias in the distribution of the SNV alleles while attempting to control for potential false positives. If you have genomic sequence data you can use the allele ratio in the\nDNA as the expected frequency to control for chromosome copy number. \nCare should be taken in the selection of SNVs. Homozygous SNVs or SNVs within duplications will appear to have strong allele-specific effects.  It is recommended that you filter SNPs prior to \nrunning ABC (i.e., those mapping to a motif). In addition, ABC does not filter duplicated reads, therefore the user may wish to remove duplicated reads prior to running ABC. \n\t--bg (Optional)\t\t\tSpecify a .bedgraph file capturing the ChIP-Seq signal (shifted read pileups) of the BAM/SAM file.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be useful to prioritize SNPs with low coverage, since they may fall within centre of the +ve and -ve strand peaks. \n\t\t\t\t\tThis phenomenon is caused by short reads and is not necessary for longer reads. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe format of the SNV file is as follows (Do not include the header): \n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the responsibility of the user to verify the quality of the SNVs (i.e., do they pass Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, etc...). \n\t--f-thres (Optional)\t\tP-value threshold for the Fisher's exact test used to test for a bias between the strand distribution of the SNV alleles.
