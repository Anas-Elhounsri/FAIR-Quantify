We are are generally available via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby) or\n[IRC](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GetInvolved#IRC_Channel).\n\n## Reporting a new issue\n\nIf no existing issue seems appropriate, a new issue can be\nopened using [this form](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench/issues/new).\n\n## How to Contribute\n\n* All changes to the [RNA-workbench](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench)\n  should be made through pull requests to this repository (with just two\n  exceptions outlined below).\n\n* If you are new to Git, the [Try Git](http://try.github.com/) tutorial is a good place to start.\n  More learning resources are listed at https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/ .\n\n* Make sure you have a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.\n\n* Fork the [RNA-workbench repository](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench) on\n  GitHub to make your changes.\n  To keep your copy up to date with respect to the main repository, you need to\n  frequently [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/):\n  ```\n    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench\n    $ git fetch upstream\n    $ git checkout dev\n    $ git merge upstream/dev\n  ```\n\n* Commit and push your changes to your\n  [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).\n\n* Open a [pull\n  request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n  with these changes. You pull request message ideally should include:\n\n   * A description of why the changes should be made.\n\n   * A description of the implementation of the changes.\n\n   * A description of how to test the changes.\n\n* The pull request should pass all the continuous integration tests which are\n  automatically run by GitHub using e.g. Travis CI.\n\n* Your pull request will be reviewed by the RNA community and merged if a member of the core team\n  approves the changes.\n\n## A Quick Note about new Tools, Workflows and Tours\n\n### Tools\n\n  Galaxy tools should be published to the\n  [Tool Shed](https://galaxyproject.org/toolshed) and specified in our\n  [tool list](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench/blob/master/rna_workbench.yml).\n  Our continuous integration tests will build a new workbench with your tool included automatically and will run\n  a few tests to check the integrity.\n\n  More information about tool development can be found [on the community hub](https://galaxyproject.org/develop).\n\n### Workflows\n  Galaxy workflows can be contributed by simply putting them into our [workflow folder](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench/tree/master/rna-workbench-workflow). Our Build infrastructure will deploy this workflow in the RNA-workbench. Please make sure that all tools needed for the workflow are integrated into the RNA-workbench. If not please add these tools beforehand.\n\n### Tours\n  Galaxy interactive tours can be contributed by simply putting them into our [tours folder](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench/tree/master/rna-workbench-tours). Our Build infrastructure will deploy all tours in this folder in the RNA-workbench.\n\n"

        "value": "For non-Kitematic users, starting the RNA workbench is analogous to start the generic Galaxy Docker image:\n\n```\n$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 quay.io/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench\n```\n\nA detailed discussion of Docker's parameters is given in the [Docker manual](http://docs.docker.io/). It is really worth reading. Nevertheless, here is a quick rundown:\n\n- `docker run` starts the Image/Container\n\n   In case the Container is not already stored locally, docker downloads it automatically\n\n- The argument `-p 8080:80` makes the port 80 (inside of the container) available on port 8080 on your host\n\n    Inside the container a Apache web server is running on port 80 and that port can be bound to a local port on your host computer.\n    With this parameter you can access your Galaxy instance via `http://localhost:8080` immediately after executing the command above\n\n- `quay.io/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench` is the Image/Container name, that directs docker to the correct path in the [docker index](https://quay.io/repository/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench)\n- `-d` will start the docker container in Daemon mode.\n\n  For an interactive session, one executes:\n\n  ```\n  $ docker run -i -t -p 8080:80 quay.io/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench /bin/bash\n  ```\n\n  and manually invokes the `startup` script to start PostgreSQL, Apache and Galaxy.\n\nDocker images are \"read-only\". All changes during one session are lost after restart. This mode is useful to present Galaxy to your colleagues or to run workshops with it.\n\nTo install Tool Shed repositories or to save your data, you need to export the calculated data to the host computer. Fortunately, this is as easy as:\n\n```\n$ docker run -d -p 8080:80 -v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/ quay.io/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench\n```\n\nGiven the additional `-v /home/user/galaxy_storage/:/export/` parameter, docker will mount the folder `/home/user/galaxy_storage` into the Container under `/export/`. A `startup.sh` script, that is usually starting Apache, PostgreSQL and Galaxy, will recognize the export directory with one of the following outcomes:\n\n- In case of an empty `/export/` directory, it will move the [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) database, the Galaxy database directory, Shed Tools and Tool Dependencies and various configure scripts to /export/ and symlink back to the original location.\n- In case of a non-empty `/export/`, for example if you continue a previous session within the same folder, nothing will be moved, but the symlinks will be created.\n\nThis enables you to have different export folders for different sessions - meaning real separation of your different projects.\n\nIt will start the Galaxy RNA workbench with the configuration and launch of a Galaxy instance and its population with the needed tools. The instance will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).\n\n> For a more specific configuration, you can have a look at the [documentation of the Galaxy Docker Image](http://bgruening.github.io/docker-galaxy-stable/).\n\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">&#x25B2; back to top</a></p>\n"
