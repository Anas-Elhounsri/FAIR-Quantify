The error on the code caused that graph paths with very low probability were keep in some cases, making the code very slow. In an extreme case, the runtime was gone from >72h to 1h, while still producing almost identical results.\r\n\r\n- The \"minimum soft-clipped length\" to attemp realignment has been set to 8. Before it was set to 4, and this causes a small decrease in precison, which could cause problems in very big datasets. Hence, the default is changed to 8 now.",

In this cases, the aligner will report a read alignment containing some of the bases unmapped (e.g soft-clipped reads). \n\nUnlike other methods, Circle-Map is able to map both segments of the soft-clipped reads by realigning the unmapped parts probabilistically to a graph representation of the circular DNA breakpoints. Which allows for a more accurate detection of the circular DNA breakpoints. In our recent paper (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3160-3) we show how this approach dramatically increases sensitivity while retaining high precision.\n\n"

In the wiki, you can try and learn using Circle-Map with the following tutorials:\n\n   * [Tutorial: identification of mappable circular DNA using Circle Map Realign](https://github.com/iprada/Circle-Map/wiki/Tutorial:-Identification-of-circular-DNA-using-Circle-Map-Realign)  \n   \n   * [Tutorial: identification of repetitive circular DNA using Circle Map Repeats](https://github.com/iprada/Circle-Map/wiki/Tutorial:-Identification-of-repetitive-circular-DNA-using-Circle-Map-Repeats)  \n\n   \nOnce you have detected circular DNA in your samples you will probably be interested at looking at the output files. To help you understanding the output, we have created a page explaining what is the information provided by Circle-Map in every column of its output. You can find the information in the following link:\n\n* [Circle-Map output explanation](https://github.com/iprada/Circle-Map/wiki/Circle-Map-output-files) \n    \n   \n\n"
