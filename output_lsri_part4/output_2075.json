        "description": "This version introduces filtering options when corset format reads (.corset-reads) are used as input. \n\nSpecifically you can filter out any read which aligns to more than N contigs (through the option \"-x <N>\"). For example, if a read aligns to more than 500 contigs it might indicate it is low in complexity and aligning to repeat sequence. We also introduce an option to filter on links between contigs. Where a \"link\" is created if a read maps to two more contigs. Links can be filtered out if they do not have enough supporting reads. For example, if only one reads maps to both contigA and contigB, it's possible these contigs do not belong in the same gene. You can filter using the option \"-l <min reads>\". A reasonable number for <min reads> would be below 10. We now also print out the number of reads which pass/fail these filters. \n\nThese filtering options are likely to speed up the clustering in many cases.\n",
