SALSA requires `bed` file as the input. This can be done using the `bamToBed` command from the [Bedtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. Also, SALSA requires bed file to be sorted by the read name, rather than the alignment coordinates. Once you have bam file, you can run following commands to get the bam\nfile needed as an input to SALSA.\n\nSince Hi-C reads and alignments contain experimental artifacts, the alignments needs some postprocessing. To align and postprocess the alignments, you can use the pipeline released by Arima Genomics which can be found here [ https://github.com/ArimaGenomics](https://github.com/ArimaGenomics).\n\n```\nbamToBed -i alignment.bam > alignment.bed\nsort -k 4 alignment.bed > tmp && mv tmp alignment.bed\n```\n"

If multiple enzymes were used, they can specified by separating with comma without space, like `-e GATC,AAGCTT`. Note that you need to specify the actual sequence of the cutting site for a restriction enzyme and not the enzyme name. For example, if you use `MboI` in the Hi-C protocol ,then you would specify it as `-e GATC`. You can also specify DNASE as an enzyme if you use an enzyme-free prep, e.g. Omin-C, as -e DNASE.\n\n"
