MHCSeqNet utilizes recurrent neural networks to process input ligand's and MHC allele's amino acid sequences and therefore can be to extended to handle peptide of any length and any MHC allele with known amino acid sequence.  \nThe current release was trained using only data from MHC class I and supports peptides ranging from 8 to 15 amino acids in length, but the model can be re-trained to support more alleles and wider ranges of peptide length.  \n"

Sequence-based model: This model use data from all MHC alleles to train a single predictor that can handle any MHC allele whose amino acid sequence is known.

Clone this repository\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/cmbcu/MHCSeqNet\n```\nOr you may find other methods for cloning a GitHub repository [here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)\n\n2. Install the latest version of 'pip' and 'setuptools' packages for Python 3 if your system does not already have them\n```\npython -m ensurepip --default-pip\npip install setuptools\n```\nIf you have trouble with this step, more information can be found [here](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel)\n\n3. Run Setup.py inside MHCSeqNet directory to install MHCSeqNet.\n```\ncd MHCSeqNet\npython Setup.py install\n```\n"
