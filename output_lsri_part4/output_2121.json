        "value": "New applications of next-generation sequencing (NGS) use pooled samples containing DNA from multiple individuals to perform population genetic analyses. SNPGenie is a Perl program which analyzes the results of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) caller to calculate nucleotide diversity (including its nonsynonymous and synonymous partitions, *\u03c0*<sub>N</sub> and *\u03c0*<sub>S</sub>) and gene diversity. Variant calls are typically present in annotation tables and assume that the pooled DNA sample is representative of some population of interest. For example, if one is interested in determining the nucleotide diversity of a virus population within a single host, it might be appropriate to sequence the pooled nucleic acid content of the virus in a blood sample from that host. Comparing *\u03c0*<sub>N</sub> and *\u03c0*<sub>S</sub> for a gene product, or comparing gene diversity at polymorphic sites of different types, may help to identify genes or gene regions subject to positive (Darwinian) selection, negative (purifying) selection, or random genetic drift. SNPGenie also includes such features as minimum allele frequency trimming (see [Options](#options)), and can be combined with upstream applications such as maximum-likelihood SNP calling techniques (*e.g.*, see Lynch *et al.* 2014). For additional background, see Nelson & Hughes (2015) in the [References](#references).\n \n"

        "value": "SNPGenie calculates gene and nucleotide diversities for sites in a protein-coding sequence. Nucleotide diversity, *\u03c0*, is the average number of nucleotide variants per nucleotide site for all pairwise comparisons. To distinguish between nonsynonymous and synonymous differences and sites, it is necessary to consider the codon context of each nucleotide in a sequence. This is why the user must submit the starting and ending sites of the coding regions in the .gtf file, along with the reference FASTA sequence file, so that the numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites for each codon may be accurately estimated by a derivation of the Nei-Gojobori (1986) method.  \nSNPGenie first splits the coding sequence into codons, each of which contains 3 sites. The software then determines which are nonsynonymous and synonymous by testing all possible polymorphisms present at each site of every codon in the sequence. Because different nucleotide variants at the same site may lead to both nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphisms, fractional sites may occur (*e.g.*, only 2 of 3 possible nucleotide substitutions at the third position of AGA cause an amino acid change; thus, that site is considered 2/3 nonsynonymous and 1/3 synonymous). Next, the SNP report is consulted for the presence of variants to produce a revised estimate of the number of sites based on the presence of variant alleles. Variants are incorporated through averaging, weighted by their frequency. Although it is relatively rare, high levels of sequence variation may alter the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites in a particular codon.  \nSNPGenie calculates the number of nucleotide differences for each codon in each ORF as follows. For every variant in the SNP Report, the number of variants is calculated as the product of the variant\u2019s relative frequency and the coverage at that site. For each variant nucleotide (up to 3 non-reference nucleotides), the number of variants is stored, and their sum is subtracted from the coverage to yield the reference\u2019s absolute frequency. Next, for each pairwise nucleotide comparison at the site, it is determined whether the comparison represents a nonsynonymous or synonymous change. If the former, the product of their absolute frequencies contributes to the number of nonsynonymous pairwise differences; if the latter, it contributes to the number of synonymous pairwise differences. When comparing codons with more than one nucleotide difference, all possible mutational pathways are considered, per the method of Nei & Gojobori (1986). The sum of pairwise differences is divided by the total number of pairwise comparisons at the codon (<sub>*n*</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, where *n* = coverage) to yield the mean number of differences per site of each type. This is calculated separately for nonsynonymous and synonymous comparisons. Calculating nucleotide diversity codon-by-codon enables sliding-window analyses that may help to pinpoint important nucleotide regions subject to varying forms of natural selection. \n"

        "value": "* **\"coverage is 0\" WARNING.** SNPGenie will run even when some sites lack sequencing coverage. Sometimes this presents no problems, *e.g.*, if all sequences lack coverage in the same regions or at terminal sites. **However**, if coverage differs between samples, this will affect diversity estimates and will need to be accounted for: one sample might have relatively low diversity simply because numerous sites lack coverage. Such a difference is not biological, but rather a result of incomplete data. As always, it is up to the user to understand their own data, and to only supply samples that are biologically meaningful. \n* Make sure end-of-line characters are in Unix LF (\\n) format. Although an attempt has been made to ensure SNPGenie can accept Windows CRLF (\\r\\n) or Mac CR (\\r) formats, these can sometimes introduce unexpected problems causing SNPGenie to crash or return all 0 values. This is often a problem when saving Excel spreadsheets on Mac, which defaults to a Mac newline format. Trying changing the newline character to Unix LF using a free program such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/\">TextWrangler</a>. \n* Make sure the SNP calling frame correct (e.g., do the codons for a product in the SNP report begin with ATG and end with TAA, TAG, or TGA?). \n* Make sure the product coordinates in the GTF file are correct. (You might use a free program such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.megasoftware.net/\">MEGA</a> to check that the CDS coordinates begin with ATG and end with TAA, TAG, or TGA, if that's what you expected.)\n \n"

Just open the Windows Command Prompt, and remember to type \"perl\" first when you run SNPGenie, *i.e.*, type \"perl snpgenie.pl\". Unfortunately, if this does not work, we are unable to provide any further Windows support. \n* Try preceding the whole command line with \"perl\" to make sure SNPGenie is being treated as a script. For example: \n        perl snpgenie.pl --minfreq=0.01 --snpreport=mySNPreport.txt --fastafile=myFASTA.fa --gtffile=myGTF.gtf\n    \n* Make sure that the first line of the script contains the correct path to your machine's copy of Perl. Right now SNPGenie assumes it's located at **/usr/bin/perl**. You can find out if this matches your machine by typing **which perl** at the command line. If it's a different path than the one above, copy and paste your machine's path after the **#!** at the beginning of the SNPGenie script. \n* Make sure that the script is executable at the command line, as follows: \n* Make sure CLC files are tab (\\t)-delimited. \n* Make sure Geneious files are comma-separated. \n* Make sure the SNP reports contain all necessary columns.

Multiple individual genomes have been sequenced separately, with SNPs summarized in the VCF file. SNPGenie will require the following in the **INFO** column:\n\t* **AN**, the number of alleles sequenced (*e.g.*, \"AN=60\"). If absent, will use **NS**, the number of samples (*i.e.*, individual sequencing experiments) being summarized (*e.g.*, \"NS=30\");\n\t* **AF**, the fractional (decimal) allele frequency(-ies) for the variant alleles in the same order as listed in the ALT column (*e.g.*, \"AF=0.200\"). If multiple variants exist at the same site, their frequencies must be separated by commans (*e.g.*, \"AF=0.200,0.087\").\n\n2. **FORMAT (2):  --vcfformat=2**. Variants have been called from a pooled deep-sequencing sample (genomes from multiple individuals sequenced together). SNPGenie will require the following in the **INFO** column:\n\t* **DP**, the coverage or total read depth (*e.g.*, \"DP=4249\");\n\t* **AF**, the fractional (decimal) allele frequency(-ies) of the variant alleles in the same order as listed in the ALT column (*e.g.*, \"AF=0.01247\"; \"AF=0.01247,0.08956\" for two variants; etc.).\n\n3. **FORMAT (3): --vcfformat=3**. Like format 2, variants have been called from a pooled deep-sequencing sample (genomes from multiple individuals sequenced together). Unlike format 2, SNPGenie will require the following in the **INFO** column:\n\t* **DP4**, containing the number of reference and variant reads on the forward and reverse strands in the format *DP4=\\<num. fw ref reads\\>,\\<num. rev ref reads\\>,\\<num. fw var reads\\>,\\<num. rev var reads\\>* (*e.g.*, \"DP4=11,9,219,38\").\n\t* **N.B.**: if multiple single nucleotide variants exist at the same site, this VCF format does not specify the number of reads for each variant. SNPGenie thus approximates by dividing the number of non-reference reads evenly amongst the variant alleles.\n\n4. **FORMAT (4):  --vcfformat=4**. **THE MOST COMMON FORMAT.** Like formats 2 and 3, variants have been called from a pooled deep-sequencing sample (genomes from multiple individuals sequenced together). For this format, SNPGenie requires AD and DP data in the **FORMAT** and **\\<SAMPLE\\>** columns, where **FORMAT** is the final column header before the **\\<SAMPLE\\>** column(s) begins. The order of the data keys in the **FORMAT** column and the data values in the **\\<SAMPLE\\>** columns must match.\n\t* The **FORMAT** column must include the **AD** (allele depth; read count) tag, which refers to the read depth of the reference and each variant allele in the **\\<SAMPLE\\>** column(s). Values for variant allele(s) must be in the same order as listed in the **ALT** column (*e.g.*, \"AD\" in the FORMAT column and \"75,77\" in the \\<SAMPLE\\> column). Note that the first value in AD refers to the read count of the reference nucleotide, followed by any variant nucleotides. Thus, for sites with one SNP, this will contain two values, and the field for the sample should be \\<ref\\_count\\>,\\<alt\\_count\\>; for two SNPs, \\<ref\\_count\\>,\\<alt1\\_count\\>,\\<alt2\\_count\\>; and so on;\n\t* For coverage (total read depth), include **DP** in the **FORMAT** column, which refers to the total read depth in the **\\<SAMPLE\\>** column(s) (*e.g.*, \"DP\" in the FORMAT column and \"152\" in the \\<SAMPLE\\> column). If the value of **DP** does not equal the sum of reads for all variant nucleotides (sum of **AD** values), the latter will be used.\n\nAs usual, you will want to make sure to maintain the VCF file's features, such as TAB(\\t)-delimited columns. Unlike some other formats, the allele frequency in VCF is a decimal.\n"
