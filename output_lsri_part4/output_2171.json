Any particular site in the alignment can only be sampled once. This is equivalent to randomly shuffling the sites of the alignment. \nSite sampling can be performed within predefined data partitions. This might be useful if you wish to generate bootstrap replicates with the original data partitions preserved.  \nSequence labels (names) can also be randomly reassigned.
