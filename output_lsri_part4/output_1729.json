Used to open image, close software etc.\n4. `Tool`: use the mouse to interact on the diagram and show small icons on the toolbar, such as a brush.\n5. `Table`: operate on the table, such as statistics analysis, sorting, plotting.\n6. `Widget`: widgets that are displayed in panels, such as the navigation bar on the right, the macro recorder, and others.\n7. `Markdown`: markup language, when clicked, a separate window will pop up to display the document.\n8. `Macros`\uff1acommand sequence file for serially fixed operational procedures.\n9. `Workflow`: combination of macro and MarkDown to create an interactive guidance process.\n10. `Report`: a xlsx template with specific mark, rename as `.rpt`, used to auto generate report.\n"

Based on the universal matrix structure and the corresponding rules, numpy-based libraries such as scipy, scikit-image, scikit-learn and other scientific computing libraries have brought great convenience to scientific research. On the other hand, more and more problems in biology, material science and other scientific research can be efficiently and accurately solved via scientific computing, image processing.\n\nHowever there are still many researchers that lack programming skills. Thus it is a crucial to make the Numpy-based scientific computing libraries available to more researchers. ImagePy brings the computing capacities closer to the non-programmer researchers, so that they won't need to be concerned about the UI and interaction design, and focus exclusively on the algorithm itself, and finally, accelerate open-source tool building or even commercial products incubation. These tools, meanwhile, can let more researchers, who are not good at programming, gain, promote and popularize scientific knowledge such as image processing and statistics.\n"
