It is implemented in python 3 and relies on the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management system. SEPATH was produced specifically to provide researchers with the ability to conduct ultra high throughput metagenomic studies from raw data to classification and has been benchmarked on simulated human cancer whole genome sequence datasets.\n\nSEPATH provides users with the ability to:\n\n-   Filter host-aligned BAM files to obtain potential non-host sequences\n-   Process BAM files or paired end FASTQ files to obtain taxonomic classifications (using Kraken or mOTUs2) with additional outputs that are either assembled contigs or high quality, non-host sequencing reads\n\nThe latest updates to SEPATH can be found on [GITHUB](https://github.com/), please feel free to submit feature requests and bug reports.

We advise the user adjusts this parameter according to the quality of their data. [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is a great tool for quick visual analysis of sequencing data quality and can provide you with some insight into how much data you will remove by setting a particular Phred score cut off. We have set the default value low to account for lower quality data.\n-   `kraken_db` - The path to the kraken database (only required to set if using Kraken pipeline (assembly)). See Kraken documentation for advice in generating these files. For our analysis we use contig level and above genomes on NCBI RefSeq.

While this is simple and routine for those that know how, we provide a script for those that don't (or for the lazier among us): `return_files.py`.\n\nAs long as `return_files.py` is in your system PATH (mentioned above), the script can be launched by typing in `return_files.py`\n\nOnce this script has launched you will be prompted to enter the directory containing the files that you want to process, enter the absolute path to the files of your interest. Then enter the end of the files that you would like to find within that directory, the files will be saved to input\\_files.txt. This script will provide SEPATH with the list of files that it requires (one file per line). Use of this script is demonstrated below.\n\n    #navigate to the tutorial folder from within the SEPATH directory\n    $ cd tutorial/\n    $ return_files.py\n    Enter directory containing files: /gpfs/home/user/scratch/Scripts/SEPATH_BETA/tutorial/files/\n    Enter extension of files to process (i.e. .fastq.gz): .bam\n    4 files found, writing to input_files.txt\n    $ cat input_files.txt\n    /gpfs/home/user/scratch/Scripts/SEPATH_BETA/tutorial/files/001.bam\n    /gpfs/home/user/scratch/Scripts/SEPATH_BETA/tutorial/files/002.bam\n    /gpfs/home/user/scratch/Scripts/SEPATH_BETA/tutorial/files/003.bam\n    /gpfs/home/user/scratch/Scripts/SEPATH_BETA/tutorial/files/004.bam\n\n"
