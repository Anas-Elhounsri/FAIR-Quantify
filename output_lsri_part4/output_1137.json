        "value": "The peak caller will create various output files, some of which are less relevant and only useful for debugging. The two files containing peak information are:\n* **(base_name)max_paths.intervalcollection**: This file contains the peaks in a JSON format. This file can be read by graph peak caller in a Python script, e.g. by doing:\n```\nfrom graph_peak_caller.peakcollection import PeakCollection\npeaks = PeakCollection.from_file('max_paths.intervalcollection', text_file=True)  # text_file=True since this file is not compressed\nintervals = peaks.intervals  # This is now a list of all your peaks, represented as intervals in the graph\n```\n* **(base_name)sequences.fasta**: This is a fasta file containing the sequences of all your peaks (requires a vg graph to be sent to the peak caller).\n\nOften, it is useful to know the approximate position of the peaks on a linear reference genome. Graph Peak Caller has a subcommand for doing that, which requires as input a \"linear path\" through the graph which it will project the peaks down to. Luckily *vg* contains path information in (most) graphs, so it it fairly easy to extract the path:\n```\ngraph_peak_caller find_linear_path -g graph.nobg vg_graph.json ref path.interval\n```\nHere *ref* should be the name of the path in the vg graph. Usually, this is 'ref', but it can also be the name of the chromosome that the graph is representing (which it will be if you have whole genome graphs). A linear path will be written to path.interval, and we can use that to project the peaks:\n```\ngraph_peak_caller peaks_to_linear max_paths.intervalcollection path.interval chromosome linear_peaks.bed\n```\nChange *chromosome* to the chromosome that you want to be used when writing the bed file. Note that the position in the bed files will be the offset on the linear path. If you graph is only representing a part of a chromosome, e.g. the MHC region, they will be the offset from the beginning of MHC, and you might want to correct for that if using the bed file in further analysis.\n\n"

        "value": "If you want to do Peak Calling on a whole-genome reference, vg will typically produce one graph for each chromosome, and it is best to divide the peak calling into one process for each chromosome. You can simply do that by sending multiple graphs and input files to the `callpeaks` command, but if you are running on huge data, it will be faster to start one callpeaks process for each chromosome and run these in parallel. An important thing to keep in mind then, is that each process should only run until p-values have been computed before continuing, since q-values needs to be computed from all p-values. Check out [this guide](https://github.com/uio-bmi/graph_peak_caller/wiki/Graph-based-ChIP-seq-tutorial) for a detailed explanation on how that can be done.\n"
