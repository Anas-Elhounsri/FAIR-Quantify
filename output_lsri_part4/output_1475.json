No contribution is too small, and we especially appreciate usability improvements like better documentation, tutorials, tests, or code cleanup.\n\n## Project scope\nWe hope MHCflurry will grow to include **reference implementations for state-of-the-art approaches for T cell epitope prediction**. This includes pan-allele MHC I and II prediction and closely related tasks such as prediction of antigen processing and immunogenicity. It does not include tasks such as B cell (antibody) epitope prediction, prediction of TCR/pMHC interactions, or downstream tasks such as cancer vaccine design. All committed code to MHCflurry should be suitable for regular research use by practioners. This likely means that new models will require a benchmark evaluation with a publication or preprint before they can be accepted.\n\nIf you are contemplating a large contribution, such as the addition of a new predictive model, it probably makes sense to reach out on the Github issue tracker (or email us at hello@openvax.org) to discuss and coordinate the work.\n\n## Making a contribution\nAll contributions can be made as pull requests on Github. One of the core developers will review your contribution. As needed the core contributors will also make releases and submit to PyPI.\n\nA few other guidelines:\n\n * Any generated resource, such as trained models, must be associated with a `GENERATE.sh` script in [downloads-generation](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry/tree/master/downloads-generation). Running this script with no arguments should fully reproduce the generated result. Reproducability of MHCflurry trained models and related data (such as curated training data, allele sequences, etc.) is key to allowing others to build upon and improve our work.\n * MHCflurry supports Python 2.7 and 3.3+ on Linux and OS X. We can't guarantee support for Windows. If you are having trouble running MHCflurry on Windows we would appreciate contributions that help us address this.\n * All functions should be documented using [numpy-style docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) and associated with unit tests.\n * Bugfixes should be accompanied with test that illustrates the bug when feasible.\n * Contributions are licensed under Apache 2.0\n * Please adhere to our [code of conduct](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).\n\nWorking on your first Pull Request? One resource that may be helpful is [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n"

        "description": "This maintenance release fixes various minor issues. The models are not changed, and predictions should be identical to previous versions.\r\n\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n1. Tensorflow dependency updated to 'tensorflow>=2.12.0'. We no longer run TF in version 1 compatibility mode.\r\n2. Changed `mhcflurry-predict-scan` to be more intuitive. See #219 \r\n3. Make unit tests deterministic by correctly setting the random seed (we were setting it incorrectly before)\r\n4. Use `yaml.safe_load` instead of `yaml.load` (fixes #215)\r\n5. Switch to github actions for CI/CD instead of travis\r\n6. Update Dockerfile to work with recent docker versions\r\n7. Various small fixes to eliminate warnings\r\n\r\nThanks to @walid0925 for his helpful contributions on this release!",

        "description": "Calling this version 2.0.0 to recognize that MHCflurry has evolved quite a bit in the last year. This release itself is not a major departure from the 1.6.0 version, however.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 introduces new models (BA/AP/PS). These follow the same overall design as in 1.6.0 but incorporate updated training data and some small tweaks:\r\n* BA predictor: MS hits are assigned < 100 nM affinity instead of < 50 nM for training\r\n* AP predictor: flanking window size decreased to 5 amino acids per flank from 15. Not seeing an accuracy decrease and it makes the models faster.\r\n\r\nThe code has been ported to tensorflow 2.0. Users will need to upgrade to a recent tensorflow to use MHCflurry.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n* Support for percentile ranks for PS predictions\r\n* Revamped Docker support\r\n* Small fixes and docs updates",

New command: `mhcflurry-class1-select-allele-specific-models`\r\n- Support for multiple training passes. For alleles with little data (default <1000 measurements) pre-train the network on data from similar alleles (in terms of sequence) before training on the real data.\r\n\r\nMinor changes\r\n- default ensemble centrality measure is bumped back to \u201cmean\u201d, but \u201crobust mean\u201d may still be used as an option\r\n- include mass-spec data from IEDB (in addition to systemhcatlas + Abelin Immunity)\r\n- Arbitrary dataframes of metadata may be attached to Class1AffinityPredictor instances using the \u201cmetadata_dataframes\u201d instance variable. Exact training data used is now included in the models directory for the standard predictors.\r\n\r\nNew downloads\r\n- models_class1_unselected . Full ensembles pre-model selection.\r\n- models_class1_minimal. Ensemble size=1 predictors for rapid testing\r\n- models_class1_no_mass_spec . Model selection w/o mass spec. Enables accuracy evaluation using mass-spec data.\r\n\r\nRefactoring\r\n- Parallelism-related code is now in the library (parallelism.py) instead of in the train command\r\n- Percentile rank calibration is now in its own command (`mhcflurry-calibrate-percentile-ranks`) instead of being bundled with the training script\r\n\r\nOptimizations\r\n- Explicit, configurable handling of multiple-GPUs for training and model selection. Workers are assigned either GPUs or left to run on a CPU, enabling simultaneous use of all available GPUs and CPUs. \r\n- Cache repeated calls to `Class1NeuralNetwork.predict` that use the same `EncodableSequences` object to specify peptides. Also a variety of optimizations to `Class1AffinityPredictor.predict_to_dataframe`. These were required for model selection to have an acceptable runtime.\r\n- Smarter caching of compiled neural networks. Reuse compiled networks even when they differ in certain aspects (e.g. number of training epochs) that we know do not affect the prediction code.\r\n\r\nRemoved\r\n- Cross validation (no longer required since held-out training data enables a direct estimate of generalization error using the pre-model selection full ensemble)\r\n- models_class1_experiments1",
