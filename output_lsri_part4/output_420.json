Select :menuselection:`Plugins --> PyVOL --> Settings -->` :guilabel:`Install PyVOL from PyPI` to fetch PyVOL and any missing dependencies. Once PyVOL has been installed, the location of MSMS must be added to the path. In the `MSMS Settings` panel, common locations for the executable can be searched. Once an executable has been identified and is displayed, :guilabel:`Change MSMS Path` can be clicked to make that executable visible to the back-end. The GUI should then display that it can find MSMS. For academic users and non-academic users with the Schrodinger incentive PyMOL distribution, installation is now complete.
