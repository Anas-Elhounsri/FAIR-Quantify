        "value": "This tool extracts heterozygous kmer pairs from kmer count databases and performs gymnastics with them. We are able to disentangle genome structure by comparing the sum of kmer pair coverages (CovA + CovB) to their relative coverage (CovB / (CovA + CovB)). Such an approach also allows us to analyze obscure genomes with duplications, various ploidy levels, etc. \nSmudgeplots are computed from raw or even better from trimmed reads and show the haplotype structure using heterozygous kmer pairs. For example (of an older version): \nEvery haplotype structure has a unique smudge on the graph and the heat of the smudge indicates how frequently the haplotype structure is represented in the genome compared to the other structures. The image above is an ideal case, where the sequencing coverage is sufficient to beautifully separate all the smudges, providing very strong and clear evidence of triploidy. \nThis tool is planned to be a part of [GenomeScope](https://github.com/tbenavi1/genomescope2.0) in the near future.\n \n"

        "description": "This is the first draft of automated smudgeplots - plots that reveal genome structure without any assumptions about assembly, mapping and base quality scores.\r\n\r\nRight now we have:\r\n- non-optimized python script to extract kmer pairs\r\n- Rpackage and R scirpt to generate a smudgeplot out of the extracted kmers\r\n- a small R smiplet to guess L/U thresholds for kmer filtering\r\n\r\nEverything should be operational, but it was not extensively tested",

        "value": "The input is a set of whole genome sequencing reads, the more coverage the better. The method is designed to process big datasets, don't hesitate to pull all single-end/pair-end libraries together.\n\nThe workflow is automatic, but it's not fool-proof. It requires some decisions. Use this tool joinlty with [GenomeScope](https://github.com/tbenavi1/genomescope2.0). The tutorials on our wiki are currently outdated (build for version 0.2.5), and will be updated by 18th of October. \n\nSmudgeplot generates two plots, one with coloration on a log scale and the other on a linear scale. The legend indicates approximate kmer pairs per tile densities. Note that a single polymorphism generates multiple heterozygous kmers. As such, the reported numbers do not directly correspond to the number of variants. Instead, the actual number is approximately 1/k times the reported numbers, where k is the kmer size (in summary already recalculated). It's important to note that this process does not exhaustively attempt to find all of the heterozygous kmers from the genome. Instead, only a sufficient sample is obtained in order to identify relative genome structure. You can also report the minimal number of loci that are heterozygous if the inference is correct.\n"
