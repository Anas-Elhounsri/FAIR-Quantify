        "value": "PhylOTU leverages reference 16S sequence data (high-quality, full-length) to construct an evolutionary model via the cmbuild function in INFERNAL. \n\nBecause of the particular licensing agreement, we cannot currently distribute the reference data we use in our study with this software (though we are working with the publishers of the reference data to change this). We recommend contacting the Ribosomal Database Project to obtain the reference library described in the RDP v 10 manuscript:\n\n> Cole et. al. The Ribosomal Database Project: improved alignments and new tools for rRNA analysis. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Jan;37(Database issue):D141-5. Epub 2008 Nov 12.\n\nYou can alternatively create your own 16S reference alignment (that includes secondary structural information), though we would recommend independengly evaluating the model you build from this alignment. \n\nThe reference alignment is used to build a CMmodel using INFERNAL's cmbuild program. This model enables sensitive alignment of fragmented reads that are phylogenetically diverse from the full-length reference sequences within the context of the reference multiple sequence alignment. The specific cmbuild run-time parameters depend on various characteristics of the reference alignment. If you use the RDP reference alignment mentioned above, the following command will build a CMmodel (the same we use in the manuscript): \n\n> cmbuild --rf --ere 1.4 *name of model* *reference alignment file*\n\nFor the above command to work, your reference alignment file must be in stockholm format. Alternative alignments may require different settings, but will generally look like the above command. PhylOTU will build the model for you (using the above parameters as defaults, see section C below for more), but it only needs to occur once. Since this is a time intensive process, ensure that you not telling PhylOTU to unnecessairly rebuild a model. When you use the *-first* parameter (see section C, above), PhylOTU will automatically try to build the model for you, so odds are good you'll never need to worry about this. If you do this by hand, any models you construct should be placed in \n\n> *database*/reference/profiles/ \n\nand the corresponding reference alignment should be placed in \n\n> *database*/reference/aligns\n "

        "value": "PhylOTU is a software workflow that identifies OTUs directly from metagenomic reads. Because of the \nparticular methodology employed in PhylOTU, reads that share no sequence overlap (i.e., cannot be \naligned to one another) can still be clustered into the same OTU. In addition, reads are not recruited into\ntop BLAST hits, but are effectively clustered de novo.\n\nBriefly, PhylOTU uses a CMmodel of the 16S locus (via INFERNAL) to align metagenomic reads. The CMmodel\nis contrusted using a reference alignment of high-quality, full-length 16S sequences. A phylogenetic tree\nis constructed from the multiple sequence alignment of reads and reference sequences via FastTree. The\nphylogenetic distance spanning every pair of reads is then calculated from the resulting tree and used \nto create a distance matrix describing pairwise read relationships. This distance matrix is then fed into \nMOTHUR, which implements average-neighbor clustering to identify OTUs. The final output (a list of OTU clusters)\nis a file in the matrix subdirectory of the metagenomic sample set with the following typed name:\n\n> *path_to_database*/samples/*SAMPLE_NAME*/matrix/*SAMPLE_NAME*.an.list\n"

        "value": "PhylOTU organizes the sample, reference, and workflow output data via the use of a flat file database. While you may specify the root location of the database, the subdirectory structure is controlled by PhylOTU. Once you have designated a location for your database, you need to initialize it. This involves creating the organizational hierarchy, building the STAP blast databases, and training the 16S CMmodel from the reference alignment (see section B, above). Some of these steps take a few moments (dependent on reference sequence database size), but only need to be conducted once. With the infrastructure established, PhylOTU can run relatively quickly on very large metagenomic datasets. \n\nPrior to initialization, you'll need to set a few variables: the database path, the PhylOTU code path, and the path to your reference alignment (optional). To set the database path, open otu_handler.pl and point the variable $masterdir to the location you want to install your database. Alternatively, run PhylOTU at the command line using the __-db path_to_database__ parameter. You will also need to hardcode the location of the PhylOTU source code on your computer in otu_hander.pl. Specifically, point the variable $scripts_path to your code. Alternatively, use the __-sd path_to_code__ parameter at run time. It is recommended that you hardcode these location within otu_handler.pl since this is unlikely to change once installed. To point to the reference alignment, use the __-ra path_to_reference_alignment__ parameter at run-time.\n\nTo initialize the database and have PhylOTU build your CMmodel from a reference alignment of your choosing, run the following command at the command line in the directory where you have the PhylOTU code installed (this builds the bacteria model):\n \n> perl otu_handler.pl -first -ra *path_to_bacteria_reference_alignment* -bac\n\nto build the archaeal model, use the following command:\n\n> perl otu_handler.pl -first -ra *path_to_archaea_reference_alignment* -arc\n\nIf you didn't hardcode the database and code paths in otu_handler.pl, you'd amend the above statements with the appropriate command line options. For the bacteria example:\n\n> perl otu_handler.pl -first -ra *path_to_reference_alignment* -db *path_to_database* -sd *path_to_code*\n\nThis command will initialize the aforementioned database and reference files, including the CMmodel. If you want to build multiple CMmodels (e.g., one for bacteria and one for archaea), simply run the first of the two above commands multiple times, pointing *-ra* to a different reference alignment each time. If you want to initialize the database and then build a CMmodel by hand (see section B, above), run the following command in the same directory:\n\n> perl otu_handler.pl -first\n\nNote that you will be unable to use PhylOTU until you build a cmmodel.\n\nGenerally speaking, you are now ready to process a metagenomic library with PhylOTU.\n"
