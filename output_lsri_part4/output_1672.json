It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs. \n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression. \n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well. \n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n \n"

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

Input is GTZ format\n    \n\texamples:\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution analysis\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.fasta` \n\t\n\tOther ways to use:\n\t\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.fasta\u3000--donot_pack_ref\u3000--cache_path /cache/path/`\n\n\n\tCommand Description:\n\n\t1) --ref\n\t\n\t  This parameter is recommended to specify, specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file\n\t  \n\t2) --donot_pack_ref\n\t\n\t  if use this parameter,  it needs to specify the reference file when unzips, here is in.fq.species.fasta\n\t  \n\t3) --cache_path\n\t\n\t  The default cache path is ~/.config/gtz, you can also use this to specify other path\n\n\n  ###### How it works:\n\n\tWhen entered as a GTZ file, FASTP-GTZ can be briefly described as four procedures:\n\t\n\t    (A) read into In.gtz-> (B) unzip into In.fq-> (C) processing Data-> (D) compressed into IN.GTZ\n\n\tNote\n\t##### 1) Process B\n\t\n\t   i. If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

Input is GTZ format\n    \n\texamples:\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution analysis\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.fasta` \n\t\n\tOther ways to use:\n\t\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.fasta\u3000--donot_pack_ref\u3000--cache_path /cache/path/`\n\n\n\tCommand Description:\n\n\t1) --ref\n\t\n\t  This parameter is recommended to specify, specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file\n\t  \n\t2) --donot_pack_ref\n\t\n\t  if use this parameter,  it needs to specify the reference file when unzips, here is in.fq.species.fasta\n\t  \n\t3) --cache_path\n\t\n\t  The default cache path is ~/.config/gtz, you can also use this to specify other path\n\n\n  ###### How it works:\n\n\tWhen entered as a GTZ file, FASTP-GTZ can be briefly described as four procedures:\n\t\n\t    (A) read into In.gtz-> (B) unzip into In.fq-> (C) processing Data-> (D) compressed into IN.GTZ\n\n\tNote\n\t##### 1) Process B\n\t\n\t   i. If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t"

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is the version of the high-multiplier compression file of gtz 1.x.x, then Process B requires the corresponding rbin file, then there are two ways to work:\n\t   \n\t   Mode one: \n\t       You have the Rbin file locally and specify the path of the file with the following environment variables: \n\t       \n\t\t   export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin\n\t       Then the program will complete step b using the local Rbin file\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       You do not have the Rbin file locally, or you do not specify it through an environment variable, in which case the program automatically downloads the rbin from the network, and of course the process consumes a certain amount of time\n\t       \n\t  ii. If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.

If the in.gtz in process A is a high-multiplier compressed file version of gtz 2.x.x, then Process B also works in two ways:\n\t  \n\t  Mode one:\n\t  \tIn.gtz is generated using --donot-pack-ref, we must specify the fasta file which is used when compression by the following environment variables:\n\t\t\n\t\texport GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa\n\t  Mode two:\n\t  \tin.gtz generation is not used -- donot-pack-ref, then procedure B does not need additional parameters\n\n\t##### 2) Process C\n\n\t    fastp-gtz Analysis Data\n\n\t##### 3) Process D\n\n\t   Mode one: \n\t       No FASTA file is specified, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by ordinary compression\n\t   Mode two:\n\t       FASTA file is specified by --ref, out.R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz are generated by High-ratio compressioncompression directly\n           \n        \n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\t#####\tTest command\n\n\t`fastp -i in.R1.fq.gz -I in.R2.fq.gz -o out.R1.fq.gz -O out.R2.fq.gz`\n\n\t`fastp-gtz -i in.R1.fq.gtz -I in.R2.fq.gtz -o out.R1.fq.gtz -O out.R2.fq.gtz --ref in.fq.species.bin`\n\n\n\t#####\tTesting environment\n\n\tServer configuration: 16 core CPU, 64G memory; file size: in.R1.fq.gz(1.55G), in.R2.fq.gz(1.78G), in.R1.fq.gtz(0.43G), in.R2.fq.gtz(0.61G)\n\n\t#####\tPerformance data\n\n\tfastp total output file size of R1.fq.gz and out.R2.fq.gz is 3.3G, and the fastp-gtz total output file size of R1.fq.gtz and out.R2.fq.gtz is 1G\n\t\n## 11\u3001MINIMAP2 for GTZ <span id=\"minimap2\"></span> (support gtz version < 2.x.x)\n\n- **How to Install?**\n    \n    ##### Mode one: Install to the current user, no sudo permissions required\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n    `curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    After the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit to log back in, and then you can execute minimap2-gtz in any directory\n    \n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install\n    \n    `sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n    Similarly, after the first installation, you need to perform a source ~/.bashrc or exit and log back in again\n        \n    ##### Mode two: Install to all users, need sudo permissions\n    For installation you can (recommended)  \n    \n\t`sudo curl -SL https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run -o /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run && sudo sh /tmp/minimap2_gtz_latest.run`  \n\t\n    ###### or\n    download installation files\uff1a[-GTX.Zip minimap2-gtz-]( https://gtz.io/minimap2_gtz_latest.run )\uff0cthen install  \n    \n\t`sudo sh minimap2_gtz_latest.run`\n\t\n\tAfter the installation is complete, you can perform minimap2-gtz in any directory\t\n\t\n\t\n   - **How to Use?**\n\n    After installation, minimap2-gtz will be generated.\n    \n    ### Use examples\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/`\n    \n   \t`minimap2-gtz -ax asm20 ref.fa pacbio-ccs.fq.gtz > aln.sam`\n        \n\t>  <font size=1>\\* In this example, the path of the RBIN file is specified by the environment variable GTZ_RBIN_PATH, where \"export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/\" is not necessary, but if you know the path of rbin, you are advised to specify it, which can speed up the processing of minimap2-gtz.

It consists of two softwares : bwa 0.7 and bwa-opt 0.7.   \n\t- bwa-opt 0.7 is the optimized version that is about 30% faster than standard bwa, and its mapping results are completely consistent with those of standard bwa.       \n- **[BOWTIE](#bowtie) / [BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip](#bowtie2)** is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to long reference sequences. It can input XXX.gtz file directly, and You can use this tool as if you are using the official version.  \n\t- BOWTIE for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE 1.2.2 version.  \n\t- BOWTIE2 for GTX.Zip based on BOWTIE2 2.3.4.3 version. \n\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Feature<span id=\"feature\"></span>\n\nGTX.Zip compressor system features:\n- **High Compression Ratio**: The system implements Context Model compression technology, with a variety of optimized predicting model, and balancing the system concurrent and memory resources consumption, thus achieving a extreme high compression rate. For FASTQ files, GTX.Zip is capable to compress the original fastq file to 2.53%. The compression rate of GTX.Zip is about 3-6 times of gzip compressor which could save up to 80% storage space and transfer costs.\n\n Data List|Compression rate of GTX.Zip|Compression rate of Fastq.gz\n ---|:--:|---:\n Nova_wes_1.fq|2.53%|17.15%\n Nova_wes_2.fq|3.45%|18.34%\n nova_wgs_1.fq|3.18%|17.55%\n nova_wgs_2.fq|3.93%|18.66%\n nova_rna_1.fq|4.56%|17.70%\n nova_rna_2.fq|5.39%|18.94%\n\n- **High Performance**: GTX.Zip fully exploits the concurrency of the CPU, the new Haswell CPU architecture, and the computing power of the new instructions such as AVX2, BMI2, which makes GTX.Zip gain high compression speed even on a ordinary computing server, with the throughput of 1100MB/s for a single compression node. GTX.Zip Enterprise supports large-scale distributed compression.\n\n- **Safety Guarantee**: Thanks to its high speed, during the process of GTX.Zip compression, the data decompression and restore test is performed. The compression process will be done only after the data has been confirmed exactly the same as the source data. MD5 validation is performed to ensure data integrity as well.\n\n- **Software Ecology**: GTX.Zip provides command line and GUI decompression software for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows. It also provides SDK interfaces in languages such as Python, C, C++, etc. which is convenient for third-party developers to read and write gtz file (GTX.Zip compression format) directly. For example, gtz version of bcl2fastq, fastp and BWA are supported by community now.   \nIf you want to get these softwares, please go to [-GTZ Ecology Softwares-](#ecology).    \n- **Nirvana Plan**:   \nAs an enterprise-level software, GTX.Zip has developed a nirvana program for high-availability requirements to ensure that users can decompress compressed data into original data under the extreme condition. The nirvana plan's dual availability protection strategy is as follows:\n\t-  GTX.Zip is multi-site hosted. http://gtz.io website, GitHub and other sites will permanently host all versions of GTX.Zip, to make sure that it is available to the entire network all the time and free of charge at any time.\n\t-  To ensure that compressed data can be restored to original file under any conditions, pre-embedded micro decompression programs could be extract from compressed data first, and then be used to decompress the file.\n\t-  Please click [-here-](nirvana-example) for usage.   \n    \n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## System Environment Requirements<span id=\"environment\"></span>\n- **64-bit Linux system (CentOS >= 6.1\uff1bUbuntu >= 12.04\uff0c < 18.04)**      \n- On the linux operating system,to achieve good performance, the computing server with **32-core 64GB** memory is recommended, or that has the same configuration with the **AWS C4.8xlarge** machine)\n\n- **64-bit Windows system (Win7,Win10)**     \n\n  \n## How to Install \uff08Linux) <span id=\"install\"></span>  \n\n- **Mode 1: Install directly from the command line(recommended installation method)**\n\nPlease visit this website to download the installation package  \n`www.gtxlab.com`  \n\n- **Verify that the installation was successful**\n\nRunning the following command, the corresponding software version information appears, indicates that the installation was successful  \n\n`gtz --version`      \n\n\t\t\n[-Back to Top-](#index)  \n  \n--------  \n\n## Quick Start (Linux)<span id=\"quick-start\"></span>\t\nGTX.Zip Professional needs to be installed on the current machine.

Compression fastq/fastq.gz (high-power compression)\n\n##### 1.1 Default compression mode for fastq\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.fastq.gz corresponding species, and the fasta file also supports the gz format.Note: After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.2 Default compression mode for bam\n\n`gtz /data/nova.bam --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nThe ref parameter is used to specify the reference genome fasta file for the nova.bam corresponding species, and it's necessary. After compression, and the fasta file is no longer needed when decompress.\n\n##### 1.3 Specify the output file name\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -o /out/nova.gtz`\n\n-o parameter specifies the output file name, note that the lowercase letter o\n\n##### 1.4 Decompression and Check after Compression Completion\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --verify`\n\nAfter the data compression is completed, GTX.Zip will decompress it again to verify data MD5 and ensure that data can be fully restored. When the compressed file is used for archiving, this verify parameter isrecommended to be added. It is not necessary to add this parameter in peacetime.\n\n##### 1.5 Fast compression\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -l 1`\n\n-l Parametric specified compression level. 1-5 is a fast compression mode. The current compression algorithm used in 1-5 is the same, here is mainly for future expansion. The same compression algorithm used in 6-9, which is also for future expansion. 6 is the default compression level, that is, the highest compression algorithm.\n\n##### 1.6 Limit compressed threads\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna -p 4`\n\n-p parameter specifies the number of threads used for compression,Here -p 4 means that only 4 threads will be used in the entire compression process, which is very useful when there are not enough computing resources.\n\n##### 1.7 Modify the default cache path\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --cache-path /path/cache/`\n\nWhen using -- ref to specify fasta, GTZ converts FASTA to the corresponding binary file and caches it to the default path (/ home / user /. config / gtz), so that when the same FASTA is specified for the next compression, GTZ can read data directly from the cache path, which is relatively fast. You can use this parameter if you need it (for example, / home/user does not have enough space)\n\n##### 1.8 Do not package fasta files\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna --donot-pack-ref`\n\nUsing the-donot-pack-ref option, the resulting target gtz file is smaller, but the corresponding fasta needs to be specified when unzipping. We do not recommend using this option because without this option, the compression ratio has little effectcompared to this option, but if you use this option, you need to specify the appropriate fasta when unzipping and you have to ensure the fasta is properly saved in safe disk.\n\n#### 2. Ordinary compression\n\n##### 2.1 compression fastq/fastq.gz\n\n`gtz /data/nova.fastq.gz`\n\nWhen not using --ref to specify fasta, GTZ compresses the fastq file normally, and the compression rate of common compression is much lower than that of high compression in most cases.\n\n##### 2.2 Compression of non-fastq/fastq.gz files\n\n`gtz /data/test.bam`\n\nGTZ can compress any file\n\n#### 3. Decompression\n\n##### 3.1 Decompress the fastq.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz`\n\nUnzipping gtz files with fasta compression by default does not require fasta files, which is a feature of gtz2.x.x\n\n##### 3.2 Decompress the bam.gtz file with FASTA compression without FASTA\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz`\n\n`gtz -d nova.bam.gtz --bam-to-sam`\n\ndefault, bam.gtz is unzip to bam, if want to unzip to sam, add paramters --bam-to-sam\n\n##### 3.3 Unzip the gtz file with fasta compression. You need to specify fasta\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz --ref /fasta/genomic.fna(.gz)`\n\nIf the compression takes fasta, and uses the-donot-pack-ref parameter, you need to specify the fasta to be used when decompressing.\n\n##### 3.3 Decompress to terminal\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -c 2>/dev/null`\n\n-C parameter represents decompression to the terminal. 2>/dev/null means that other prints are removed and only the extracted fastq content is printed.\n\n##### 3.4 Unzip to the specified path\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -O /path/out/`\n\n-O parameter specifies the output directory of the decompressed file. Note that the capital letter O\n\n##### 3.5 Limit decompression threads\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.gtz -p 4`\n\nThe -P parameter is also suitable for decompression, here the -P 4 means that only four threads are used for decompression.\n\n##### 3.6 Unzip low version gtz files with bin compression\n\n`gtz -d nova.fastq.old.gtz -r Homo_sapiens_bcacac9064331276504f27c6cf40e580.rbin`\n\nThe -r parameter is used for compatibility with GTZ version, which is lower than 2.0.0. Version 2.0 can compress any GTZ file in the old version. When the old version of GTZ compresses fastq text and uses the -b parameter to specify the corresponding bin file, then version 2.0.0 can use - r to specify the corresponding RBIN file to decompress the old version of GTZ file.\n\n### Parameter description:\n```  \n--ref <string>\n\t@ compress : specifies Fasta corresponding to the compressed file,\n\twhich results in a higher compression rate\n\n\t@ decompress : if compression uses Fasta and parameter\n\t--donot-pack-ref is used, the corresponding Fasta needs to be\n\tspecified by this parameter when decompressing\n\n--bam-to-sam\t\n     \t@ compress : do not use\n\n     \t@ decompress : decompress bam to sam, it's valid only for BAM,\n     \totherwise bam decompressed to bam\n\n-z,  --fastq-to-fastq-gz\n\t@ compress : do not use\n\n\t@ decompress : decompress fastq to fastq.gz, it's valid only for\n\tFASTQ\n\n--cache-path <string>\n\t@ compress : when Fasta is specified by --ref, GTZ converts the Fasta\n\tto the corresponding binary file and then caches it to the default\n\tpath, so that when the same Fasta is specified for compression, GTZ\n\tcan read directly data from cache path, which is relatively fast.\n\tdefault cache path is /home/xuxl/.config/gtz, you can use this\n\tparameter to change it\n\n\t@ decompress : same as compress\n\n--donot-pack-ref\n\t@ compress : this option is not recommended.

Due to some changes in the data structure of the lookup table, bwa-opt-gtz is incompatible with the index file data generated by the original bwa. According to the standard steps of bwa, first regenerate the index file, and then compare it with bwa-opt-gtz.\n\n\tThe difference between bwa-gtz and bwa-opt-gtz is as follows:\n\n\t(1) bwa-gtz can directly use index produced by official website BWA, and its performance is consistent with official website BWA.\n\n\t(2) bwa-opt-gtz can not directly use the index produced by BWA on official website. index needs to be reproduced by bwa-opt-gtz, but its performance will be improved by 1/3 than that of BWA on official website.\n\t\n\n\t#### Use examples\n\n\t##### Step one: Skip this step if the decompression read.gtz does not require a reference file,  otherwise specify the corresponding reference as follows\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/rbin/` (Suitable for gtx1.x.x version, specify the rbin file path for unzip, it's recommended but not required, when not specified gtz will download automatically, will consume a certain amount of time)\n\n\t`export GTZ_RBIN_PATH=/path/fasta/xxx.fa`  (Suitable for gtx2.x.x version, specifies the corresponding fasta file for decompression, must)\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\n\t#### bwa-opt-gtz\n\n\t##### Step one: Remake index (must)\n\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz index ref.fa`\n\n\t##### Step two: execution comparison\uff0cif the decompression requires a specified reference file, refer to bwa-gtz using the example step one\n\t\n\t`bwa-opt-gtz mem ref.fa read1.fq.gtz read2.fq.gtz -t 4 -o aln-pe.sam`\n\t\n\t\n- **performance**\n\n\t\n\tIn the case of sufficient server resources, the performance of bwa-opt-gtz is 1/3 better than that of official bwa.
