The MrsFAST executable must be installed into your $PATH in order to run the program.\n\nThen, click on the \"release\" link at the top of this repository page, or navigate to: https://github.com/njdbickhart/RAPTR-SV/releases\n\nYou can download the latest RAPTR-SV jar files from that link. In order to run RAPTR-SV, you will have to invoke it with the java 1.8 executable. Here is an example of how to run the program:\n\n> /path/to/jdk1.8.0/bin/java -jar /path/to/RAPTR-SV.jar\n\nRunning the program without any arguments will list the program help menu.\n"

        "value": "  1. A BWA-aligned BAM\n  2. A MrsFAST-indexed, Repeat-Masked Reference genome fasta\n\nIn order to view the command line options for this mode of the program, just enter the following command on the command line:\n\n> /path/to/jdk1.8.0/bin/java -jar /path/to/RAPTR-SV.jar preprocess\n\nHere is a brief listing of the command line options for the \"preprocess\" mode:\n\n> -i (file name) (REQUIRED) An input BAM file. The BAM must be sorted by basepair coordinates. If the BAM is not indexed, RAPTR-SV will index the BAM before processing it\n\n> -o (file path) (REQUIRED) The path and base name for all of the \"preprocess\" output files. This is the prefix text that will be appended to all of the output files. This can include the output directory (NOTE: this directory must exist ahead of time!)\n\n> -r (file name) (REQUIRED) A MrsFAST indexed reference genome file. Please make sure that the chromosome names of this reference file match the chromosome names in your BAM header! Also, repeatmasking of this reference may increase speed of processing.\n\n\n> -g (nothing) (OPTIONAL) Ignore the read groups in the BAM. This may result in faster performance if your bam has multiple read groups that are all derived from the same DNA library.\n\n> -m (integer) (OPTIONAL) Maximum distance threshold for discordant read pairs [default: 1,000,000 bp]. Any read pair that has an insert length above this threshold will be ignored by the program. This helps reduce false positives, but may cause you to ignore true, large events.\n\n> -s (integer) (OPTIONAL) Metadata sampling limit [default: 10,000 read pairs]. This is the number of read pairs sampled by the \"preprocess\" mode to determine the average insert size and insert standard deviation. This value is also used to calculate how many read pairs are stored in memory while determining read pair discordancy, so reducing this value will reduce memory overhead.\n\nRAPTR-SV will generate four files for each read group of the bam that you \"preprocess\" (unless specified by using the '-g' option, which ignores all readgroups). Here are the files and a brief description of each:\n  1. A discordant read pair map file (*.divet)\n  2. A BAM file with split-read anchoring reads (*.anchor.bam)\n  3. A BAM file with split-read mappings (*.bam)\n  4. A tab-delimited text file giving the full paths of the above three files, and the average insert length and insert standard deviation for each read group of the bam (*.flat)\n\nPlease note that the \"flat file\" (*.flat) is the input for the RAPTR-SV \"cluster\" mode which will make insertion, deletion and tandem duplication calls on your data. If you have multiple bam files for the same sample, you can \"preprocess\" each bam individually and then concatenate the \"flat files\" together before running the entire dataset through RAPTR-SV \"cluster\" mode.\n\nIf you run RAPTR-SV with the \"-d\" flag, it will generate a \"Samsupport.tab\" file that contains all of the discordant reads in the BAM file. This is simply for debugging purposes, and this file can be safely deleted after running the program."

You can concatenate the contents of multiple flat files together for each run of RATPR-SV \"cluster\", but it is assumed that the flat files must point to the same individual sample.\n\n> -o (file path) (REQUIRED) The path and base name for all of the \"cluster\" output files. This is the prefix text that will be appended to all of the output files. This can include the output directory (NOTE: this directory must exist ahead of time!)\n\n\n> -c (string)    (OPTIONAL) Process only this chromosome. This option allows you to focus on only one chromosome at a time in the program which may be useful for parallelizing RAPTR-SV clustering. Default behavior is to process every chromosome present in the split read BAM file generated by the \"preprocess\" step.\n\n> -g (file name) (OPTIONAL) Assembly gap file. This file contains a list of assembly gaps in \"BED\" file format (please see: http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1 ) that will be ignored by the \"cluster\" algorithm. This is not required, but is highly recommended to reduce false positive calls.\n\n> -m (float)     (OPTIONAL) Set the mapping quality filter for discordant read pairs [default: 0.0001]. This will eliminate ambiguous mappings from the \"divet\" file prior to clustering. Very useful for highly repetitive genomes/scaffolds. \n\n> -f (float)     (OPTIONAL) Set the set weight threshold for SV calls [default: 1.00]. This filter can be raised or lowered to increase or decrease the sensitivity of the caller, respectively. Higher values improve performance of the program but may miss some variants that have lower depth of coverage. (Will be streamlined in future versions of the algorithm)\n\n> -i (integer)   (OPTIONAL) Set the raw read count threshold for SV calls [default: 2]. Increasing this value can improve the performance and specificity of the program. Still, higher values may miss SVs within areas of low sequence coverage.\n\n> -b (integer)   (OPTIONAL) The number of sets to hold in memory at one time [default: 10]. In order to reduce the memory overhead (but increase the runtime of the program) you can lower this value. WARNING: this value must be greater than zero!\n\nInsertion, deletion and tandem duplication output files will be generated by the cluster mode and will display information in a tab delimited file with the following columns:\n  1. chromosome\n  2. Outside start (the extreme outer edge of read alignments used to find this event)\n  3. Inside start (the beginning of the probable SV event -- if split reads map to this event, this is likely the start breakpoint of the SV)\n  4. Inside end (the end of the probable SV event -- again, more accurate if split reads aligned)\n  5. Outside end (the extreme outer edge of read alignments used to find this event)\n  6. The SV type prediction\n  7. The number of discordant read pairs that support this event\n  8. The number of balanced split reads that support this event\n  9. The number of unbalanced split reads that support this event\n  10. The total weighted support of all reads that supported this event (cumulative scores from discordant reads and split reads; \"-f\" controls the minimum value reported)\n"
