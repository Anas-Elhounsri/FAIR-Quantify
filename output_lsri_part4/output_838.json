For detailed explanation, please refer to the paper: Guo et. al., CellTag Indexing: a genetic barcode-based multiplexing tool for single-cell technologies, bioRxiv, 2018 (new version under review).\n\nIn brief, we introduce a new multiplexing approach using CellTag - a lentiviral-based barcode system. This system allows CellTags to be transribed and captured using single-cell RNA-sequencing, further enable us to use CellTag as the identifiers for each cell. A step in this process is to identify the true signal among different CellTags; thus, further recover the identities of cells in the single-cell transcriptome. Here, we share the source code and demonstrate the usage and flow of this classification approach on a human-mouse species-mixing dataset with two CellTags tags (Mouse Tag - GTTGGCTA, Human Tag - TGCTATAT).\n"

In such case, each CellTag expression across all cells should have ~50% zero and the remaining as significantly expressed. This allows us to assume that CellTags' expression across cells would share similar density functions. Under this assumption, we will examine the significance of each CellTag expression, i.e. what is the likelihood of occurrence of each expression value.\n\nFor each CellTag expression, we compute the density function *D* of its expression across all cells. Each cell's expression for each tag is then examined via a modified permutation test. In brief, for expression of a CellTag in a cell to be tested, we draw 1,000 samples from the density functions and calculate the proportion of samples that are greater than or equal to expression level at test. If the proportion calculated is small, it indicates that it is unlikely to get an expression at such level suggesting relatively higher expression overall, which, we consider, as an identification signal. For instance, consider expression (*C<sub>ij</sub>*) of CellTag *j* in Cell *i*, we draw 1,000 sample *S* from the density of CellTag *j*, *D<sub>j</sub>*. The proportion was computed as shown below.

For instance, in the matrix below for Cell *i*, minimum of each row if calculated. If all minimums are coming from the same CellTag column, we identify such tag as one of the Cell *i*'s identities. On the other hand, if there are some mixing source of different CellTag columns, it is more likely to be a multiplet. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of minimum column does not eliminate the probability for the cell to be a multiplet as other CellTags could share similar level but slightly higher proportions. Hence, for cells with unique minimum column, we examine the pair-wise differences between the minimum tag and other tags. Using a difference cutoff of 0.238, we characterize the CellTag within less than 0.238 difference from the minimum tag to be another identity for the cell. This difference cutoff is obtained via benchmarking and training against the species mixing result based on 10x classification. In brief, we iterate through this function with different thresholds and calculate Cohen's Kappa score for the correspondence between CellTag and 10x classification. The difference that gives the optimal Kappa score is selected to be our base line threshold.\n\nThis function takes the normalized matrix, proportion list, and the users' threshold.
