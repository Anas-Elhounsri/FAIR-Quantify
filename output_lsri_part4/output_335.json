The initial step is to install Anaconda python distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for Windows, Linux and macOS OS. Choose 64-bit and Python 3.6 version for download and install. After download and install it, start a terminal (in Windows use <b>Anaconda Prompt</b> NOT default terminal), type <b>conda --version</b> to check if conda has been successfully installed. \n\nOnce conda has been installed, (in the terminal) type the following two commands\n\n<b>conda config --add channels rdkit</b> \n\n<b>conda create -c curieshicy -n my-jrgui-env jrgui</b> \n\nThe first command adds the channel of a dependency package--rdkit (One may use <b>conda config --get channels</b> to check channels that have been added). The second one-line command first adds my conda channel <b>curieshicy</b> and then creates a virtural environment named <b>my-jrgui-env</b> where all dependency Python packages will be installed. The usage of a virtural environment has the advantage of avoiding potential conflicts of different versioned Python installed at default system path. The specific environment created will be only used for JRgui program. After executing these two line-commands Conda will automatically find dependency packages and install them all. \n\nTo use JRgui program, the users first need to activate the virtural environment (in Windows type <b>activate my-jrgui-env</b>; in Linux and macOS type <b>source activate my-jrgui-env</b>. To quit virtural environment replace <b>activate</b> with <b>deactivate</b>), and type <b>jrgui</b> to invoke the GUI. \n\n<b>Note</b> For macOS system, as of 10/27/2017, please make sure to install your conda with a version number 4.3.25, which can be done by typing \n\n<b>conda install conda=4.3.25</b>\n\nOtherwise when loading RDKit, it will show error messages such as \"Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread\" or \"Segmentation fault: 11\". Please see the post by the author of RDKit, Dr. Greg Landrum on this bug/issue (https://www.mail-archive.com/rdkit-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07325.html).\n\nThe installation and test of JRgui program has been performed on Windows 7, 8.1, 10, Linux Ubuntu 14.04.5 and macOS 10.10.3 (all 64-bit OS). For your reference, the corresponding screenshots are accessible at https://github.com/curieshicy/JRgui/tree/master/Installation_and_Test. \n"
