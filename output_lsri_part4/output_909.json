There are many ways you can help be part of the Leaf developer community.\n\nPlease take a minute to review this document to make your contribution easy and effective for everyone involved.\n\n## Posting an Issue \n\nPlease utilize GitHub issue tracker to post\u202fbugs, feature enhancements, and to submit pull requests. Keep the following in mind when creating an issue - Please:\n\n- Do not use the issue tracker for support. We will post documentation if a support issue is found to be common with our partners. \n\n- Do not\u202fpost opinions or otherwise unstructured/irrelevant information. Keep the focus on the discussion at hand.\n\n- Use relevant pre-determined labels; \u2018feature request\u2019 or \u2018bug\u2019?\n\n- Keep the issue title clear and concise. \n\n## Bug reports \n\nA bug is a\u202fdemonstrable problem\u202fwith a list of steps that were taken to get said bug. Also, the cause has to be limited strictly by the code in the repository. Posting bug issues are extremely helpful for the greater good and we HIGHLY encourage you to post directly to the Leaf repo. \n\nGuidelines for bug reports: \n\n- Please check if the issue has already been reported. \n\n- Please check if the issue has been addressed\u202f\u2014 perform a \u2018test\u2019 and try reproducing your bug using the latest development branch in the repository. \n\n- Isolate the problem\u202f \n\nA good rule of thumb - a bug report shouldn't leave folks hanging, and they shouldn\u2019t have to chase you down to get more info. With that said, please try to be as detailed as possible and start each report by answering the following questions:  \n\n- What is your environment?  \n- What steps will reproduce the issue?  \n- What did you expect the outcome to be/ what should have happened?  \n- What *did* happen? \n \n## Features and enhancements \n\nOf course, feature requests are welcome, but please take into account if your request fits in with the greater good of the community. More than likely you will not be the only one that would benefit from your request, but still try to think critically about it. Please provide as much detail and context as possible. \n\n## Pull requests \n\nGood pull requests - improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. \n\nPlease ask us first\u202fbefore embarking on any significant pull request, we really want big feature enhancements, etc. to be a collaborative effort. Please reach out to us! \n\nPlease adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage). \n\nFollow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the project: \n\nFork\u202fthe project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes: \n\n```bash\n# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory \ngit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/leaf\n\n# Navigate to the newly cloned directory \ncd leaf \n\n# Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\" \ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/uwrit/leaf\n```\n\nIf you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream: \n\n```bash\ngit checkout <dev-branch>\ngit pull upstream <dev-branch> \n```\n\nCreate a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix: \n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\nCommit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these\u202fgit commit message guidelines\u202for your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's\u202finteractive rebase\u202ffeature to tidy up your commits before making them public. \n\nLocally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch: \n\n```bash\ngit pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch> \n```\n\nPush your topic branch up to your fork: \n\n```bash\ngit push origin <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\nOpen a Pull Request\u202fwith a clear title and description. \n\nIMPORTANT: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow us to license your work under the same license is that used by the project. \n\n "

        "description": "This release adds support for customization of Leaf's splash page, dependency upgrades (including [.NET Core 6!](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)), and various bug fixes and minor changes.\r\n\r\n# New features\r\n- #578 - Leaf's splash page now allows for custom credits. You can add multiple logos and even custom text. Example: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/232629591-fe068bf0-7436-4a7f-87b4-5c5b4c0ad81f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/232629630-75dfc27d-3454-4167-8692-f896422126e5.png)\r\n\r\n- #587 - In a related feature, in case you don't need the QI/Research selection screen but DO need to show an attestation, you can now configure the splash screen to skip directly to the attestation. Simply set `Attestation.SkipModeSelection`: `true`\r\n\r\n# Minor features\r\n- #509 - The Patient List now allows for custom date ranges.\r\n\r\n# Bug fixes\r\n- #515 - On the Patient List, birthdates could be off by several hours due to timezone offsets.\r\n- #586 - The admin panel could fail to load if no record is in the app.DemographicQuery table.\r\n- #558 - Upon exporting a Patient List to csv, in certain cases columns would be duplicated.\r\n- #553 - To avoid syntax errors specific to Oracle, Leaf avoids using underscores in table aliases and avoids using \"AS\" for table alias syntax (e.g., \"mytable ~~AS~~ X\").\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.11.3\r\n1. **IMPORTANT** Leaf 3.11.3 is the first version of the API to use [.NET Core 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0). Make sure you update your app server environment appropriately, with compilation done using the .NET 6 SDK and deployment with .NET 6 Runtime.\r\n2. **Client app and server API** - Download and deploy the latest client and server compiled files under **Assets**, included in this release (or compile on your own as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps)), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n3. **Database** - execute the [3.11.2__3.11.3](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.11.2__3.11.3.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.\r\n",

Leaf further assumes that you also have a `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable and associated `key.json` file. See [https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#getting_credentials_for_server-centric_flow](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#getting_credentials_for_server-centric_flow) for more information.\r\n\r\n   Note that `Db.Clin.RDBMS` is **required**, even if you are planning to (continue) using SQL Server.\r\n\r\n- #514 - Related to support for new database flavors, this also enables the App and Clinical databases to be deployed to separate databases servers (which is **required** if *not* using SQL Server, else **optional**).\r\n\r\n- #513 - The Visualize and Patient List screens can now be enabled, even when `LowCellMasking` is on. Special thanks to @artgoldberg and @glabrie10 for invaluable implementation suggestions and ideas. \r\n\r\n# Minor changes\r\n- #489  - The Patient List \"+ Add More Data\" modal now defaults to \"Anytime\" (previously was \"Past 6 Months\").\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.11.0\r\n1. **Client app and server API** - Download and deploy the latest client and server compiled files under **Assets**, included in this release (or compile on your own as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps)), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n2. **Database** - execute the [3.10.1__3.11.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.10.1__3.11.0.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.\r\n3. **appsettings.json** - Update the appsettings file as specified above.\r\n",

Sinai, who has been a great partner and has helped us continue to improve Leaf. Most of the features in this release were suggested and brainstormed by Professor Goldberg.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n- #453 - Leaf can now be set to \"Maintenance Mode\", which prevents users from logging in and running queries, while Leaf Admins are able to. As maintenance mode is designed to be managed programmatically, there is no admin UI component. Instead, Admins can set Leaf to maintenance mode via the Leaf app database `app.ServerState` table.\r\n\r\n   **To set Leaf to maintenance mode *immediately*, run something like:**\r\n\r\n    ```sql\r\n    UPDATE app.ServerState\r\n    SET IsUp      = 0\r\n      , Updated   = GETDATE()\r\n      , UpdatedBy = 'admin'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n   **To set Leaf to maintenance mode *from and until a specified time*, run something like:**\r\n\r\n    ```sql\r\n    UPDATE app.ServerState\r\n    SET DowntimeFrom  = '2022-02-01 17:00:00' /* Feb. 1st 5pm */\r\n      , DowntimeUntil = '2022-02-01 19:00:00' /* Feb. 1st 7pm */\r\n      , Updated       = GETDATE()\r\n      , UpdatedBy     = 'admin'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Leaf will automatically initiate and end maintenance mode at the intervals specified in `DowntimeFrom` and `DowntimeUntil`. You can also set an optional message to users using `DowntimeMessage`, else Leaf will default to showing:\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/149022382-33075343-7cb9-4987-a047-29f9c30401f3.png)\r\n\r\n- #495 - Leaf can also notify users of new features, upcoming events, or any other custom message needed with the **Notifications** feature. Like maintenance mode, notifications are designed to be used programmatically via the Leaf database.\r\n\r\n    **To send a notification to users, run something like:**\r\n\r\n    ```sql\r\n    DECLARE @msg NVARCHAR(1000) = 'Leaf will be down for maintenance on Wednesday February 1st from 5 to 7pm.'\r\n    DECLARE @user NVARCHAR(20)  = 'admin'\r\n    DECLARE @showUntil DATETIME = '2022-02-01 17:00:00'\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO app.Notification (Message, Until, Created, CreatedBy, Updated, UpdatedBy)\r\n    SELECT @msg, @showUntil, GETDATE(), @user, GETDATE(), @user\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    The message will appear in the lower-right corner of users' screens:\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/149023884-031095f4-c494-4e77-b89a-aad79449ecae.png)\r\n \r\n    Note that even active, already-logged-in users will be shown the message as the client syncs at 30 second intervals to the server and updates users with any new notifications. Like maintenance mode, notifications can also be set to expire by specifying the `Until` SQL column.\r\n\r\n## Minor features and changes\r\n- #490 - Contributed by @jnothman, Patient List datasets now show a nice icon to better indicate any date filters present:\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/149024445-a2880d33-c829-4d54-83c3-6ae4b4d8160f.png)\r\n - #476 - Also by @jnothman, the default text shown to users for queries not yet saved is now \"Unsaved Query\", rather than \"New Query\" (previous). \r\n- #498 - The term \"blacklist\" in database tables and API services has been renamed to \"Invalidated\".\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.10.1\r\n1. **Client app and server API** - Download and deploy the latest client and server compiled files under **Assets**, included in this release (or compile on your own as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps)), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n2. **Database** - execute the [3.10.0__3.10.1](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.10.0__3.10.1.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.\r\n3. **appsettings.json** - No changes are needed to the appsettings file.",

        "description": "Leaf 3.10.0 focuses on adding community-requested features for user authorization, custom attestations, maintenance and more.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n- #465 - Leaf now allows for user **Authorization** to be handled by SQL tables within the Leaf app database. Note that this is ***not Authentication***, which still relies on SAML2 for determining the user.\r\n\r\n    To enable app database-based authorization:\r\n    1. Set `Authorization.Mechanism` to `\"APPDB\"`\r\n    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/137990100-6c2c98c1-db2a-4df9-84b6-f6257389e5ba.png)\r\n\r\n    2. Run the [3.9.2__3.10.0 database migration script](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.9.2__3.10.0.sql) to add two SQL new tables for user authorization. \r\n\r\n    This feature has no UI component and is designed to be managed purely by admins via SQL. User roles and groups can be added like the example below, with `ScopedIdentity` matching the username sent by the IdP:\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/137990958-2e1d60c6-c98d-41a5-ba06-174d368fa851.png)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n- #466 - In cases where **all** authenticated users should be allowed as Leaf users (rather than only members of a specific group), you can now allow them by adding `Authorization.AllowAllAuthenticatedUsers`: `true`:\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/137991799-9d56ed6e-aec2-4a03-bd7a-d1593769c0a7.png)\r\n\r\n    `AllowAllAuthenticatedUsers` can be used with both `SAML2` and `APPDB` Authorization.\r\n\r\n- #419 - Custom attestations can now be entered, superseding the default Leaf attestation text shown in the UI upon login (if enabled). This can be used by adding `Attestation.Type` and `Attestation.Text` to the appsettings.json file, where `Attestation.Type` is either `\"HTML\"` or `\"TEXT\"`, and `Attestation.Text` is an array of strings.\r\n\r\n    **HTML usage example**:\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/138181180-a9154723-4f41-4904-8235-76d6506211b3.png)\r\n\r\n    **Text usage example**:\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/138181319-adb2d07f-eacd-4ede-8e5f-03b74031d184.png)\r\n\r\n   The custom attestation will then be displayed to users:\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/137992800-a8fb6956-e05f-46d0-bc80-0c091f0c96b3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Minor features and changes\r\n- #417 - The logout button and feature can now be disabled, requiring a small modification to the appsettings.json file:\r\n\r\n    Change\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/137993561-3839d808-e90c-4991-8169-273cf76f798a.png)\r\n\r\n    to\r\n\r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/137993423-1fb775a0-ed65-453a-9eee-5e9643e68d97.png)\r\n\r\n    Where the previous `Authentication.LogoutURI` is now `Authentication.Logout.URI`, and can be disabled used `Authenication.Logout.Enabled` = `false`.\r\n\r\n- #425 - On the NIH table on the `Visualize` screen, the subtext now notes that patients without demographic information are excluded from the counts.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n- #460 - When creating a concept in the Admin UI, Leaf would crash if dropdowns were added before first saving the concept.\r\n- #447 - Leaf would incorrectly assume a SQL query to be illegal if the token `WITH` appeared within the WHERE clause.\r\n- #426 - Concept search would occasionally show a blank (no concepts) if the same search string was used twice.\r\n- #421 - Long concept text within `Timelines` would occasionally be cutoff.\r\n- #418 - Timestamps shown in the `Patient List` would not match those of the database due to timezone shifting behavior in the browser.\r\n- #420 - In cases where the user access token had been invalidated but was still cached in the browser, the web client would attempt to re-use it and fail. It now attempts to request a new token on failure.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.10.0\r\n1. **Client app and server API** - Download and deploy the latest client and server compiled files under **Assets**, included in this release (or compile on your own as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps)), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n2. **Database** - execute the [3.9.2__3.10.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.9.2__3.10.0.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.\r\n3. **appsettings.json** - Update your [appsettings.json file](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/API/appsettings.json) to include the changes outlined above.",

        "description": "Leaf version 3.8.0 adds some exciting new features, and requires an upgrade from .NET Core 2.2 to the [.NET Core 3.1.x Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1).\r\n\r\n# New features\r\n- #364 - You can now configure Leaf to either run `Find Patients` queries using the past [Common Table Expression, or CTE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) approach, where Leaf wraps each panel's query in a single CTE, or instead run individual queries for each panel in parallel. The latter can be useful in cases where you find patterns of one particularly expensive panel's query slowing down the entire CTE.\r\n\r\nFor example, given the hypothetical query:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/93514010-83bdc600-f8db-11ea-89a6-936929960341.png)\r\n\r\nLeaf would generate SQL similar to (formatted for readability):\r\n<br>\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/93515153-fd09e880-f8dc-11ea-89ef-9f588bdf995b.png)\r\n\r\nNote that in either case, the number of patients found is exactly the same but the strategies to find the cohort are different. Using the `CTE` option, Leaf combines all panel queries into a single query and leverages the SQL engine to find the intersect of the queries. Using the `Parallel` option, Leaf [runs each query in parallel](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/Services/Cohort/ParallelPatientCohortService.cs#L49) (or technically, concurrently) and [map/reduces the results of each query](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/Model/Cohort/PatientCountAggregator.cs#L15) to find the cohort in the Leaf API. \r\n\r\nThese options can be set in a [new subsection of the appsettings file](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/API/appsettings.json#L19), under `Db.CLin.`:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/93530463-78c26000-f8f2-11ea-93ad-ffabb4506253.png)\r\n\r\n- #4 - CSV exports are now available! A long-requested feature, Leaf can now export directly to CSV, in addition to the traditional REDCap export. Leaf will generate a CSV file for each `Patient List` dataset loaded.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/93531601-57627380-f8f4-11ea-8681-765a1000312c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/93531499-31d56a00-f8f4-11ea-9dd0-303458e0faa5.png)\r\n\r\n- #359 - The `\"@<scope>\"` portion of the username exported to REDCap can now be omitted by setting the [`Export.REDCap.IncludeScopeInUsername` setting](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/API/appsettings.json#L74) to `false`:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/93536973-29cef780-f8ff-11ea-8950-7e719d05dd51.png)\r\n\r\n# Bug fixes\r\n- #358 - If an ampersand (\"&\") appeared in the body of the data exported to REDCap, REDCap would throw an error when deserializing from JSON. Ampersands are now converted to empty spaces.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.8.0\r\n1. **IMPORTANT** - Leaf 3.8.0 now requires the [.NET Core 3.1.x Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1), which must be installed and replace the previously used .NET CORE 2.2.\r\n2. **Client app and server API** - Download and deploy the latest client and server compiled files under **Assets**, included in this release (or compile on your own as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://leafdocs.rit.uw.edu/installation/)), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n2. **Database** - execute the [3.7.2__3.8.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.7.2__3.8.0.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.

        "description": "Leaf 3.7 is out! We're excited to share a number of new features and fixes and look forward to the Leaf community's continued feedback and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n- #138 - A long-standing request of various Leaf sites, Leaf can now obfuscate cohort sizes. This includes the abilities to:\r\n1. Configure `Noise` `LowerBound` and `UpperBound` random obfuscations to counts of patients: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336706-787e5600-a26a-11ea-8ccf-482333127dd4.png)\r\n2. Configure a `LowCellMasking` `Threshold` beneath which counts will not be revealed:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336689-3ce38c00-a26a-11ea-9f79-43441feb7ffd.png)\r\n3. Work with federated partners, even with heterogeneous cohort obfuscation settings:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336676-1d4c6380-a26a-11ea-9542-21cba585babf.png)\r\n\r\nAll cohort obfuscation settings are optional and can be enabled using the `appsettings.json` file's new `Deidentification` category. **Note: enabling `Noise` or `LowCellMasking` will cause the API to throw an error if users attempt to click `Visualize` or `Patient List`, so it's recommended to disable those tabs if you do so.**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336590-9d25fe00-a269-11ea-9118-eacda01556de.png)\r\n\r\n- #338, #332 - Speaking of de-identification, have you ever wanted to disable or set custom ranges and increments for Leaf de-identified date-shifting? Now you can:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336575-7d8ed580-a269-11ea-8fc6-7c4a94d72de0.png)\r\n\r\n**Note: setting `Enabled`: `false` will disable Leaf's ability to de-identify PHI. Use with caution!**\r\n\r\n- #314 - Language by Ethnicity and Religion visualizations are now included in the `Visualize` tab.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336362-aada8400-a267-11ea-9318-69c2f9dc7513.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83337224-70281a00-a26e-11ea-8b95-84d80911126e.png)\r\n\r\n- #329 - The standard NIH Race, Ethnicity, and Gender matrix has also been added to the `Visualize` tab.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336375-c9d91600-a267-11ea-9b90-4d8cd549b9d5.png)\r\n\r\n- #312 - In the `Patient List`, datasets can now be extracted specific to certain encounters (rather than simple ranges of dates).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336442-4cfa6c00-a268-11ea-9e5f-d29987de79ab.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336449-5c79b500-a268-11ea-80ca-fcd556c7e95e.png)\r\n\r\n- #7, #317 - When updating the logic to an *existing* saved query, users now have the option to save it as a new query instead of overwriting the previous query.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336887-ee36f180-a26b-11ea-9b7d-906978376733.png)\r\n\r\n- #331 - The attestation screen can now be optionally disabled entirely for a Leaf instance, sending users straight into the app without needing to enter IRB information and so on. This is useful for databases that have already been de-identified.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336602-b169fb00-a269-11ea-8fa6-80cf6fce2b2e.png)\r\n\r\n- #333 - The `Visualize` and `Patient List` can now be globally disabled.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336630-e8d8a780-a269-11ea-9e0e-a28d8829b804.png)\r\n\r\n# Minor features\r\n- #330 - For convenience, every clinical query Leaf executes is now always prepended with the boolean parameters `@IsIdentified`, `@IsQI`, and `@IsResearch`, allowing Leaf concepts and datasets to handle different use contexts dynamically.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83338331-4d9afe80-a278-11ea-8192-e6ef0aa4131d.png)\r\n\r\n- #311 - In the `Patient List`, users can now scroll left or right if columns overflow available screen width.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83336559-59cb8f80-a269-11ea-9e62-6423fae2a6ed.png)\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- #318, #325 - For the last few versions (it's not clear when the bug was introduced), if no root concepts were configured the UI would throw an error upon login.\r\n\r\n- #315 - When editing in the `Admin` panel, any concepts - besides root concepts - would not immediately update in the UI to provide a preview.\r\n\r\n- #322 - Occasionally after saving a query, the query information would immediately be cleared in the UI (though the save was still successful).\r\n\r\n- #323 - When creating a REDCap Project, Leaf would not grant the user ownership and modification permissions.\r\n\r\n- #321 - Characters valid in Leaf dataset names, such as commas and slashes, would break the REDCap export process because they are illegal in REDCap. These are now converted to underscores during export.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.7\r\n1. **Client app and server API** - Download and deploy the latest client and server compiled files under **Assets**, included in this release (or compile on your own as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps)), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n2. **Database** - execute the [3.6.0__3.7.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.6.0__3.7.0.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database. \r\n3. **appsettings.json** - Version 3.7 includes new configuration entries which must be added accordingly. See the default [appsettings.json](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/API/appsettings.json) for reference.\r\n<a>\r\n     <img src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/83437549-cb841480-a3f4-11ea-998a-8e270bb1d4a4.png' width=\"200px\" align=\"center\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"6\" />\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This allows institutions to more easily track inquiries and create tickets from templated emails. Note that this features is 100% opt-in; if disabled, Leaf simply informs users of the configured administrator email.\r\n\r\n# Minor Features\r\n- #297 - Pressing `Enter` on the keyboard now closes the date and numeric filter modals. This was added for convenience, and these can still be set by simply clicking outside of the modal.\r\n\r\nNumeric filter\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/71606521-5bf8b900-2b26-11ea-945f-731125e06790.png)\r\n\r\nDate filter\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/71606529-72067980-2b26-11ea-8cd5-d541ab4397c5.png)\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- #299 - If a user logged out twice and attempted to log in again, the login would fail. This was due to a bug in how Leaf attempted to circumvent browser caching/SAML2 authentication failures (see issue for details).\r\n- #293 - REDCap imported projects now have metadata loaded on demand, rather than at login. This was not necessarily a bug, but this fix is designed to reduce heavy, unnecessary calls to the server as users login.\r\n- #292 - Very minor, but in the admin pane the 'Unsaved' and 'Delete' divs would sometimes overlap with content.\r\n- #291 - In the admin pane, concept updates would fail if the concept had any specializations defined.\r\n- #288 - In the admin pane, updating a concept's display text (the name, subname, or patient count) would fail to be properly updated.\r\n- #290 - The login modal now displays more helpful, detailed information if the initial user login fails for any reason.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.6.0\r\n- **Client app and server API** - Recompile and deploy the latest client and server API files as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n- **appsettings.json** - Version 3.6 adds a few new entries to the appsettings file which must be added accordingly. \r\n     - `Notification`\r\n          - `Enabled` (boolean, if `true`, the below properties **must** be set)\r\n          - `Email`\r\n               - `Server` (string) - the SMTP server name.\r\n               - `UseSSL` (boolean) - Determines whether Secure Socket Layer protocol should be used for transporting emails (we recommend setting this to `true`)\r\n               - `Sender`\r\n                    - `Address` (string) - email address from which to **send** emails from.\r\n               - `Receiver`\r\n                    - `Address` (string) - email address (e.g., list-serv) to **receive** send emails.\r\n               - `Credentials` (optional, only if you'd like to use a username and password to authenticate with the SMTP server)\r\n                    - `Username` (string) - Username to provide the SMTP server. This should be `LEAF_SMTP_USR`, and you if this is defined, you **must** also set a corresponding environment variable to store the actual username.\r\n                    - `Password` (string) - Username to provide the SMTP server.

        "description": "This release adds REDCap Project Import, a popular feature in the original UW-only version of Leaf which we've redesigned and reimplemented from the ground up. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/68152382-64eb5680-fef8-11e9-970f-603aff914a75.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/68152411-73d20900-fef8-11e9-81cb-ae971e5b2835.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/68155339-5f910a80-fefe-11e9-89ab-4d2b34ea265f.png)\r\n\r\n# New Features\r\n- #284 - REDCap projects can now be imported directly from a REDCap instance using API tokens. Note that a REDCap project to be imported **must** have a unique field representing patient MRNs with which to link to patients in your clinical database. (If you are using Leaf with de-identified data, then, REDCap projects cannot be imported so it is probably best to disable this feature)\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.5.0\r\n- **Client app and server API** - Recompile and deploy the latest client and server API files as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n- **appsettings.json** - Version 3.5 adds a few new entries to the appsettings file which must be added accordingly. \r\n     - `Import`\r\n          - `REDCap`\r\n               - `Enabled` (boolean)\r\n               - `ApiURI` (string) - a REDCap endpoint ending with `/api/` to be called for importing projects.\r\n               - `BatchSize` (int) - number of REDCap rows at a time to import into the LeafDB.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/68155939-99164580-feff-11e9-9fbb-055e6a020d5d.png)\r\n\r\nSee the default [appsettings.json](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/server/API/appsettings.json) for reference.\r\n\r\n- **Database** - execute the [3.4.0__3.5.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.4.0__3.5.0.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.

Previously, deployments needed to be identified only by subdomain, e.g.:\r\n- https://instance1.leaf.edu\r\n- https://instance2.leaf.edu\r\n\r\nIncluding the pathname in the token allows for a pathname-based url convention:\r\n- https://leaf.edu/instance1\r\n- https://leaf.edu/instance2\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.4.0\r\n- **Client app and server API** - Recompile and deploy the latest client and server API files as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n\r\n- **Database** - execute the [3.3.3__3.4.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.3.3__3.4.0.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.

To avoid confusion, example numeric and date filters are also commented to indicate so.\r\n- #267 - A simple slide animation in the 'show detail' query box on the top is now shown to more clear allow the user to compare patient counts as Leaf instances return data. 'show detail' now defaults to `true` if an instance is federated.\r\n- Various upstream JavaScript dependencies (React, Axios, etc.) have been updated.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- #265 - The Patient List dataset selection screen has been cleaned up and expanded to enhance search and readability, as well as various alignment and sizing peculiarities.\r\n- #264 - Previously dataset search tags would be missed if they were uppercase. This is fixed and tags can be upper or lowercase.\r\n- #263 - REDCap export would break if multiple sequential underscores appeared in a dataset or field name (e.g., \"my___dataset\"), as REDCap silently renames these to single underscores (\"my_dataset\"). Leaf now performs a check and cleans these names before sending data.\r\n- #262 - On the Visualize screen, the female/male age by gender comparison chart did not have the 2 chart components sharing a Y axis maximum, so cohorts that were largely male or female did not visually appear so. This has been fixed.\r\n- #261 - A numeric filter query for \"2.0\" (or any other value ending in \".0\") would confusingly be changed to \"2.\". This has now been fixed to allow any floating point decimal value.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.3.1\r\n- Client app - As upstream JavaScript dependency libraries were cleaned and updated in this released, **before building and re-deploying the client** you'll need to use `npm` to update the dependency packages:\r\n```bash\r\n# From /leaf\r\n$ cd src/ui-client\r\n$ npm install\r\n\r\n# Next build production client app as normal\r\n$ npm run build\r\n```\r\n- Server API - Recompile and deploy the latest server API files as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n\r\n- Database - execute the [3.3.0__3.3.1](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.3.0__3.3.1.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.

You can now use this table to track users and their \"claims\" (i.e., authentication context and user groups).\r\n- #248 - The Leaf client version is now displayed on login.

        "description": "This release fixes several bugs, and contains client, server API, and database changes.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- #236 - This appears to be a bug related to the [CSS position: fixed property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position), but after saved a query, as the query save pane on the right slides out, the main UI content would be pushed to the left. The pane slide is now delayed and occurs after the main modal fades away, which prevents the issue (likely related to their simultaneous CSS transitions).\r\n- #237 - Identified mode did not return any PHI. This had multiple causes, as the initial attestation data was not being captured due to changes in [.NET Core WebAPI 2.2 GET requests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53181095/model-binding-of-nested-properties-in-asp-net-core-2-2), as well as the Leaf API not checking the appropriate user roles to allow identified data.\r\n- #239 - After explicitly logging out, the client successfully notified the server and the IdToken was blacklisted, but did not remove it from localStorage on the client. This caused subsequent logins to reuse the invalidated IdToken, which was rejected by the server. The IdToken is now also cleared from the browser cache on logout.\r\n- #46 - The patient counts on the Visualization screen could be cut off if the bars were particularly lopsided. This is now fixed and includes padded room for up to ~1 billion patients, depending on viewport size.\r\n- #238 - The [app.sp_CalculatePatientCounts](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/obj/app.sp_CalculatePatientCounts.StoredProcedure.sql) stored procedure did not properly reset the loop number after each root concept loop, causing certain concepts to be missed when running it.\r\n- #241 - Previously it was possible to modify a query while running it, which caused unpredictable changes in UI state depending on various asynchronous event orders. This is now prevented, and information is shown the the user as to why they cannot modify it while running it.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.2.3\r\n- Client app and server API - Recompile and deploy the latest client and server API files as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n\r\n- Database - execute the [3.2.2__3.2.3](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.2.2__3.2.3.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database.

        "description": "This is a patch release which fixes several bugs related to session token refresh, concept search, and navigating to the admin panel. It also adds a snackbar-style notification on admin panel save events, removing the previous post-save/delete event notification, which forced the admin to wait ~2 seconds after each API call to continue editing.\r\n\r\n# Notable Change\r\n- #190 - After an admin save event, the admin can immediately continue editing without delay. A simple auto-disappearing notification is shown on the left after a save/delete event notifying the admin that the operation was successful.\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- #225 - The session token was not being refreshed more than twice. This was a subtle bug that would only become obvious after extended use of Leaf in a session, and was accidentally introduced in 3.2.\r\n- #223 - If the user types in exactly the text of a concept, confusingly the concept did not appear as a suggestion or hint.\r\n- #221 - If the browser is in semi-minimized mode, the tooltip for the admin panel on the left covered the side panes, disrupting the ability to click and navigate to administrative panes.\r\n- #220 - Concept search requests for many concepts (e.g., 40+) created a URL with an exceedingly long length which could be rejected by the server the API is hosted on. Concept search now returns only the top 20 results.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.2.1\r\n- As this patch involves only client application changes, assuming you are on version 3.2 you only need to recompile and re-deploy the client app under `leaf/src/ui-client`. **This version is fully compatible and should be used with API and database versions 3.2**.\r\n",

        "description": "This release focuses on significant Admin panel additions, usability improvements, and numerous bug fixes found by various sites deploying Leaf. Special thanks to @sgchoe and @weberlab for all their hard work and helpful feedback.\r\n\r\n# Notable Changes\r\n- The Admin sidebar now shows a subpane of different configuration panes, including `Concept SQL Sets` as a standalone pane.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/60122738-b27dd880-973a-11e9-97a8-92aa54c5595d.png)\r\n\r\n- #146 - Datasets can now be managed directly in the UI Admin Panel, which allows administrators to configure what datasets are available, how they are shown/restricted to users, and even check that SQL queries output expected columns.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/60123133-929ae480-973b-11e9-9547-957cf5f87223.png)\r\n\r\n- #145 - Identity (the name, description, and colors shown to users) and networked Leaf instances can now be managed directly in the UI Admin Panel.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-25 at 11 32 00 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/60123678-e0fcb300-973c-11e9-98f2-f9e1e05d6d6b.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/60123378-33899f80-973c-11e9-88b5-ccb829c6498e.png)\r\n\r\n- Improved validation during Admin Panel data entry. Required fields without data now alert the admin before save.\r\n\r\n- The browser console now logs both the currently running client version and server version for easier version checking on initial app login. Find this info by opening up the console using:\r\n    - Chrome - `Options` -> `More tools` -> `Developer tools`\r\n    - Firefox - `Options` -> `Web Developer` -> `Web Console`\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-06-25 at 11 18 53 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10424962/60123765-11dce800-973d-11e9-9421-4d315d75b096.png)\r\n\r\n- The current database version can now be found under a new [ref.Version table](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/obj/ref.Version.Table.sql)\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- #211 - The instance patient count is now rounded more predictably, depending on the number of patients. Any instances with < 1,000 patients will simply display the value.\r\n- #210 - Updating and saving an existing concept previously removed the previous concept and replaced it with a new one in the UI, which had the confusing effect of appearing to drop the concept to the bottom of a list. The previous visual position of the concept is now preserved.\r\n- #206 - Removing all children under a root concept in the UI previously did not reset their root concepts, which both prevented the empty root concept from being deleted and had severe potential side effects for concept search.\r\n- #204 - Re-parenting a concept, then subsequently saving the parent concept had a side-effect of it's previous [IsParent] flag being reverted to false, confusingly making the re-parented child concept disappear on app reload.\r\n - #203 - The [adm.sp_DeleteConcept](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/obj/adm.sp_DeleteConcept.StoredProcedure.sql) stored procedure previously left concept foreign key references in two tables untouched when run, which prevented the concept from being properly deleted. \r\n- #199 - The Learn More population visualization overflowed if more than 8 or so years' worth of data are shown. The container object now dynamically resizes, and by default shows only data for 1995 - present, and can show all data by clicking a toggle.\r\n- #189 - Visualization and Patient List API call failures did not properly indicate that they had failed, instead continuing to show a spinner. They now properly indicate failure to the user.\r\n- #175 - In `Gateway` mode, because the home API node was not queried directly on 'Run Query', as a side effect no `queryId` would be created and thus no query could be saved. `Gateway` instances now return a `queryId` but do not query or cache patient data.\r\n- #163 - App-wide API logging has been reviewed and returns consistent and reliable data for a separate service to aggregate log files and perform auditing, etc. Using log files for troubleshooting also should be easier, as failure and success points are more clearly identified, as well as their data via JSON.\r\n\r\n# Upgrading to 3.2\r\n- Client app and server API - Recompile and deploy the latest client and server API files as described in the [Leaf installation instructions](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/tree/master/docs/deploy#installation-steps), making sure to first remove any previously deployed instances.\r\n\r\n> The Leaf server API now runs on [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2), so make sure your deployment server is using this as well.\r\n\r\n- Database - execute the [3.1.1__3.2.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.1.1__3.2.0.sql) database update script on your Leaf application database. \r\n\r\n>If you aren't sure what version your current Leaf application database is, there is no harm or side effects in running the [3.0.0__3.1.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.0.0__3.1.0.sql) and [3.1.0__3.1.1](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.1.0__3.1.1.sql) migration scripts first to ensure that the database is up to date with v3.2. Note also that v3.2 adds the [ref.Version table](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/obj/ref.Version.Table.sql) specifically to avoid database version confusion going forward.",

        "description": "# Notable Changes\r\n- Improved network composition.\r\n  - Bi-directional federation now composed of 2 uni-directional channels.\r\n  - Implemented user quarantine on by default, special group membership required for federation privileges.\r\n  - Gateway runtime implemented to allow an instance of Leaf to exist in a federation without supplying data of its own.\r\n\r\n- REDCap Export now explicitly enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\n- Added visual hint to account dropdown indicating your capabilities within Leaf.\r\n\r\n- Added a CONTRIBUTING.md doc.\r\n\r\n- Significant refactoring.\r\n  - Most Leaf controller now delegate workflow to exposed Model types.\r\n\r\n- Removed unnecessary NPM dependency on arc.js, which is bundled in Leaf directly. This caused `npm run build` to require having git installed (as arc.js isn't registered in NPM).\r\n\r\n# Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed an issue where Leaf would throw on startup if there was no `LEAF_REDCAP_SUPERTOKEN` environment variable, regardless of intent to enable/disable that functionality.\r\n- Fixed an issue with the \"Need help\" button on Firefox where text would be truncated.\r\n- Fixed an issue where datasets with spaces in their names would have the space replaced by an underscore (eg, 'Platelet Count' -> 'platelet_count') silently on the REDCap side but not by Leaf. After creating the fields, Leaf would try to export data without the underscores, and REDCap would throw an error. Field names are now explicitly lowercased and spaces replaced with underscores on the Leaf side.\r\n- Fixed an issue where the Leaf client would not correctly enforce the REDCap row export limit.\r\n\r\n# Migration\r\n- If you already have a LeafDB instance you can run the migration scripts \r\n 1) [3.0.0 -> 3.1.0](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.0.0__3.1.0.sql)\r\n 2) [3.1.0 -> 3.1.1](https://github.com/uwrit/leaf/blob/master/src/db/migration/3.1.0__3.1.1.sql)\r\n\r\nNote: Any Endpoints already configured will need to updated to indicate their Interrogator/Responder status before restarting Leaf.\r\n- There are two new elements in the `appsettings.json` file.\r\n  - `Runtime` contains a single field, `Mode`.\r\n    - `Mode` can contain either the value `FULL` or `GATEWAY`.\r\n    - `GATEWAY` mode disables the `api/cohort` endpoints.\r\n  - `Export:REDCap` contains a new field `Enabled`.\r\n    - `Enabled` controls whether or not the `api/export/redcap` endpoints are listening.\r\n    - Setting this value to false disables REDCap export functionality.",
