Briefly, these methods of assessment provide an independent account of the power of a phylogenetic model and sequence data for describing the evolutionary process. These methods of assessment are different from model selection, where a set of candidate models are compared to each other under the assumption that at least the best-fitting model is an adequate description of the data.\n\nPhyloMAd supports several of the most common nucleotide and amino-acid substitution models (e.g., JC, HKY, and GTR), including gamma-distributed rates across sites with 4 discrete categories. Clock models supported include those implemented in BEAST 2.\n"

For assessment, PhyloMAd uses maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference (IQtree), parametric bootstrap simulations, and several common test statistics. Diagnostics of risk of biased inferences are provided based on previous extensive simulation studies. \n- Assessment of substitution saturation using measures of entropy. Diagnostics of risk due to excessive saturation are provided based on an extensive simulations study. \n- Assessment of the type of the strength and number of phylogenetic tree topology signals in a locus or a set of gene trees. Signal is defined as the support that appears in the data for a given species or gene tree, while the null is the signal of trees that can emerge from the model used for inference. \n- Assessment of phylogenetic clock model adequacy. This assess the expectation that the number of substitutions along branches as expressed by a clock model (times and molecular rates) is consistent with the substitutions observed when using clock-free estimation.\n \n"

In the case of this example, there will be a single folder containing three files. \n\n![outputFiles](codeFolder/www/outputFiles.png)\n\nOne is a PDF with histograms of the values of the test statistics calculated from simulated data, with the value calculated for the empirical data set shown in a red line. These graphics are useful for qualitative interpretation of the results. This qualitative interpretation is necessary for many of the test statistics until they are better understood.\n\n![exampleHist](codeFolder/www/exampleHist.png)\n\nNext is a file with an interpretation of the test for five test statistics that are known to be sensitive to multiple sources of wrong inferences of tree topology and branch lengths. These recommendations come from a detailed previous simulations study. The test allows for interpretation of the results, according to the thresholds investigated in that study. Note that while the model might be adequate regarding each of these test statistics, it might still suffer an unknown type of bias. This means that the output should be placed in context of what each of these statistics describe. See manual for more details.\n\n![chisqResults](codeFolder/www/chisqResult.png)\n\nIn this example, the chi-squared statistic test tells us that the amount of compositional heterogeneity is unlikely to be of concern.\n\nThe last file is a table that shows three values (rows) for each test statistic selected (columns). These three values include:\n\n- The tail area probability, which is the proportion of values calculated for simulations that are lower than the value calculated for the empirical data set; \n\n- The statistic calculated for the empirical data set;\n\n- The distace between the empirical data set and the mean of the simulated distribution in terms of the number of standard deviations of the distribution.\n\n![resultsTable](codeFolder/www/resultsTable.png)\n\nThis example shows that the multinomial statistic is not available for analysis. This is because this data set comes from a scenario with extremely long terminal branches. The high divergence among taxa has led to every site having a different pattern in every data set, so every simulated data set has the same multinomial likelihood as the empirical data set. This test statistic is therefore not useful in this scenario.\n"
