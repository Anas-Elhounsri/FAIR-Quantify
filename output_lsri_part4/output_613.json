Multi-threading support, including an extremely fast \"parallel write\" mode.\n2. Implementation of a new insert alignment-based trimming algorithm for paired-end reads that is substantially more sensitive and specific than the original Cutadapt adapter alignment-based algorithm. This algorithm can also correct mismatches between the overlapping portions of the reads.\n3. Options for trimming specific types of data (miRNA, bisulfite-seq).\n4. A new command ('detect') that will detect adapter sequences and other potential contaminants.\n5. A new command ('error') that will estimate the sequencing error rate, which helps to select the appropriate adapter- and quality- trimming parameter values.\n6. A new command ('qc') that generates read statistics similar to FastQC. The trim command can also compute read statistics both before and after trimming (using the '--stats' option).\n7. Improved summary reports, including support for serialization formats (JSON, YAML, pickle), support for user-defined templates (via the optional Jinja2 dependency), and integration with [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info).\n8. The ability to merge overlapping reads (this is experimental and the functionality is limited).\n9. The ability to write the summary report and log messages to separate files.\n10. The ability to read SAM/BAM files and read/write interleaved FASTQ files.\n11. Direct trimming of reads from an SRA accession.\n12. A progress bar, and other minor usability enhancements.\n \n"

At this time, we recommend to not directly interface with Atropos as a library (or to be prepared for your code to break). The internal code organization will be stabilized as of version 2.0, which is planned for sometime in 2017. \nIf you would like to suggest additional enhancements, you can submit issues and/or pull requests at our GitHub page.\n \n"

If you currently use cutadapt, you can simply install Atropos and then substitute the executable name in your command line, with one key difference: you need to use options to specify input file names. For example:\n\n```\natropos -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACGAGTTA -o trimmed.fq.gz -se reads.fq.gz\n```\n\nTo take advantage of multi-threading, set the `--threads` option:\n\n```\natropos --threads 8 -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACGAGTTA -o trimmed.fq.gz -se reads.fq.gz\n```\n\nTo take advantage of the new aligner (if you have paired-end reads with 3' adapters), set the `--aligner` option to 'insert':\n\n```\natropos --aligner insert -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACACAGTGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG \\\n  -A AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTAGATCTCGGTGGTCGCCGTATCATT -o trimmed.1.fq.gz -p trimmed.2.fq.gz \\\n  -pe1 reads.1.fq.gz -pe2 reads.2.fq.gz\n```\n\nSee the [Documentation](https://atropos.readthedocs.org/) for more complete usage information.\n"
