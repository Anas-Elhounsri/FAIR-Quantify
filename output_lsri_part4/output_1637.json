        "value": "This package is named DECRES (DEep learning for identifying Cis-Regulatory ElementS). DECRES is an extension of the Deep Learning Tutorials developped by LISA lab (www.deeplearning.net/tutorial/). Although DECRES is developped for the identification of CREs, it can also be used for other applications.  \nDECRES is composed of 7 parts as follows. \n4. New convolutional neural network for integrating multiple sources of data:\nIntegrative convolutional neural network (iCNN): icnn.py \n5. A utility module for classification is included. \nThis module is named classification.py. It includes normlization methods, class and feature pre-processing functions, post-processing functions, and visualizations of classification results. See the beginning of this module for usage information. \n6. Examples:\nFor every methods in 1 and 2, an example is provided to demonstrate how to use it.\nThe file names of these examples are main_[module_name].py \n7. Data:\nWe include our data sets for the cis-regulatory element classifications, so that our results can be reproduced and the new methods. Your new methods can be conveniently tested on these data set. These data are for 8 cell lines including four cell lines with sufficient samples and features: (GM12878, HelaS3, HepG2, K562), and four cell lines with limited number of enhancers or/and features: HUVEC, A549, HMEC, MCF7. Taking GM12878 as an example, the data are explained as below.\nGM12878_200bp_Data.txt : the feature values, each row is a sample/instance/example/feature_vector, each column corresponds to a feature.\nGM12878_200bp_Classes.txt : the class labels corresponding to the samples in GM12878_200bp_Data.txt.\nGM12878_200bp_Regions.bed : the fixed-length (200bp) regions corresponding to the samples in GM12878_200bp_Data.txt.\nGM12878_Features.txt : the list of feature names.\nGM12878_Regions.bed : the original regions of variable length corresponding to the samples in GM12878_200bp_Data.txt. \nInstallation:\nVery easy!\n1. Download the code, save it in your local directory.\n2. Add the directory to your Pyhton path, and you are ready to use it. \nWyeth W.
