        "value": "A large number of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data set was\nrecently generated to characterize the heterogeneous in cell types or\nstates in a complex tissue or biological process. Noting that the gene\nexpression in a single cell is purely determined by the transcriptional\nregulatory signals, which are largely varied through different cells,\nsingle gene's expression profile naturally form into a multi-modal\ndistribution, with each component corresponds to a possible regulatory\nstate. Multiple statistical models have been developed to capture such\nmulti-modalities (MM), for the data generated of different conditions or\ngenerated by different experimental platforms. Such models include\nQuasi-Poisson (QP), Negative Binomial (NB), Zero Inflated Negative\nBinomial (ZINB), Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG), Mixture Gaussian (MG),\nBeta Poisson (BP), Zero Inflated Mixture Gaussian (ZIMG), and Left\nTruncated Mixture Gaussian (LTMG), majorly differ by their assumptions\nof \"drop-out\", errors and MM. We have recently developed a system\nbiological model to decompose possible contributors of the\nmulti-modality and errors of scRNA-seq data. Our analysis and other\nrecent works clearly suggested varied sources of the errors and MM that\nare highly affected by experimental condition and platform. However,\nthere is lack of a computational capability to select the most proper\nstatistical model for each scRNA-seq data. \nMotivated by this idea, we developed a user-friendly R package,\nM<sup>3</sup>S, to (1) select the most proper statistical models and\ndifferential gene expression analysis method, (2) characterize varied\ntranscriptional regulatory state, and (3) identify differentially varied\ngene expressions, for a given scRNA-seq. In addition, the package can be\nalso applied to bulk tissue transcriptomics or other omics data for\ncharacterization of the MM of features. \n"
