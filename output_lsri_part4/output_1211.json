To run the demo on a local computer where this version of MATLAB is not installed (or the computer does not have any version of Matlab), a user has to install corresponding version of MATLAB Runtime (R2013a). It is a free package that can be downloaded from the  webpage:    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/. The entire contents of Demo-version must be copied and installed anywhere on the local computer. To run GUI of ARACHNE the executable file START_Arachne.exe must be launched. (See Manual.docx for details) \n\n\n2.\t\"Full-version\" contains two directories  \"host\" and \"worker\"  for installation ARACHNE in any cluster operating under Linux/Windows and any host computer operating under Windows with preinstalled Matlab. \n\n3.\t\"Matlab-version\" contains only \"host\" files with MatLab codes and the bat-files that control the communication between host computers and the preinstalled cluster. This catalogue can be downloaded at any place of \"host\" computer operating under Windows. The file Readme.md has a detail instruction about a set of steps of working with the soft. \n\n4. \"Mobile-version\" contains files for the mobile device operating under Mobile OS. \n\n\n"
