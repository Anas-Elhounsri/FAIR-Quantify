        "original_header": "2. Mapping Options",
        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "To perform read mapping, mrsFAST-Ultra should be executed with the `--search` option. By default, mrsFAST-Ultra is a all-mapper tool. This means that it finds and reports all the mappings for each input read. If no option is provided, mrsFAST-Ultra performs single-end mapping. This is an example of running mrsFAST-Ultra for mapping read sequences in the sample `reads.fq` file.\n```bash\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq\n```\nBy default, mrsFAST-Ultra sets the maximum error threshold to 6% so that %94 similarity between reads and genome is guaranteed. The error threshold could also be set using the `-e` option. Setting this value to zero means that only exact matches are desired.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4\n```\nTo trim input reads to a shorter length, `--crop` option can be used. For example if the input reads are of length 100 and `--crop 40` is used, only the first 40 base pairs of each read would be read and used for mapping.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 --crop 40\n```\nAlternatively, you may crop from tail of the reads by using `--tail-crop`.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 --tail-crop 40\n```\nmrsFAST-Ultra is able to perform mapping on multiple CPU cores in a parallel manner. The number of threads is determined using the `--threads` option. The default value is 1 which runs mrsFAST-Ultra on a single thread. If `--threads` is set to 0, mrsFAST-Ultra will use all the available cores in the system.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 --threads 4\n```\nWhen huge volumes of input reads are required to be mapped on a machine with limited memory resources, mrsFAST-Ultra is capable of adjusting itself with the specified memory limits. The total memory (in GB) available for running mrsFAST-Ultra should be specified with the `--mem` option. In this mode, mrsFAST-Ultra might perform mapping in several iterations and each time it only loads as many reads as allowed by the memory limit.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 --mem 8\n```\nIn the limited mapping mode, mrsFAST-Ultra reports only up to a specified number of mappings for each read. The `-n` option sets the maximum number of mappings per read. Reads with mapping more than this value will not be printed in the output. This option is valid in both single-end and paired-end modes, but could not be used together with best mapping (`--best`) and paired-end discordant mode (`--discordant-vh`).\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 -n 100\n```\nIn best mapping mode, for each read mrsFAST-Ultra reports a single best location which has the smallest hamming distance among all of its possible mappings. In case of a tie, one of the mapping locations with the smallest hamming distance is reported at random. This option cannot be used in paired-end discordant mode (`--discordant-vh`).\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 --best\n```\nExcept the cases that are pointed out, obviously any combination of the above options can be used together in any of the single-end and paired-end modes.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq --crop 60 -e 2 --mem 6 --threads 4 -n 100 -o mappings.sam --disable-nohits\n```\n \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "As mentioned above, by default mrsFAST-Ultra will run in single-end mode. The paired-end mapping options is invoked using the `--pe` option. If the reads are in two different files, `--seq1` and `--seq2` should be used to indicate the input files. If the reads are interleaved in a single file, `--seq` is used to indicated the file.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq interleaved-reads.fq --pe -e 4\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq1 mates1.fq --seq2 mates2.fq --pe -e 4\n```\nIf the distance range between condordant pairs is not specified as above, mrsFAST-Ultra automatically decides about this range according to the mean and standard deviation of distances observed among the mates. The distance allowed between the paired-end reads should be specified with `--min` and `--max`. These values specify the minimum and maximum of the template length (the distance between outer edges of the mapping mates).\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq1 mates1.fq --seq2 mates2.fq --pe -e 4 --min 100 --max 500\n```\nAgain, any combination of the introduced mapping options could be used in the paired-end mode.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq1 mates1.fq --seq2 mates2.fq --pe -e 4 --min 100 --max 500 --threads 4 --best -o mappings.sam\n```\nmrsFAST-Ultra can report discordant paired-end mappings for structural variation detection using [Variation Hunter](http://variationhunter.sf.net). In this mode the `--min` and `--max` options will define the minimum and maximum inferred size for concordant mappings.\n \nIn paired-end discordant mode, an upper bound can be defined for maximum number of discordant mappings per read. This values is determined by `--max-discordant-cutoff` option. This option is only applicable in paired-end discordant mode.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq1 mates1.fq --seq2 mates2.fq --discordant-vh -e 4 \\ \n  --min 100 --max 500 --max-discordant-cutoff 300\n```\n \n"

In this mode mrsFAST-Ultra tolerates the mismatches in known SNP locations provided by dbSNP database (see sample file `dbSNP.vcf`). To run in this mode, first, the snp_indexer binary should be used to create an index from the input dbSNP (vcf) file. The following command reads the sample `dbSNP.vcf` file and creates `snp.index` which is only readable by mrsFAST-Ultra. The current vcf format that is accepted by mrsFAST-Ultra is vcf version 4.\n```\n$ ./snp_indexer dbSNP.vcf snp.index\n```\nIn the next step, using `--snp` option mrsFAST-Ultra accepts the snp.index file as an input, and therefore ignores all mismatches occurring in the known SNP locations. The following command line executes mrsFAST-Ultra in SNP-aware mode using the index file created in last step.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 --snp snp.index\n```\nTo be able to distinguish mismatches occurring as a result of sequencing errors, and those caused by SNPs, mrsFAST-Ultra considers a quality threshold such that a mismatch at a reported SNP location will be ignored only if the corresponding read location has a quality higher than or equal to that quality threshold; otherwise the mismatch would affect the mapping as it is more probably caused by sequencing errors. The value of this threshold is set by the `--snp-qual` option. The default value is 53.\n```\n$ ./mrsfast --search genome.fa --seq reads.fq -e 4 --snp snp.index --snp-qual 60\n```\n \nThe SNP-aware mode could be run together with any other combination of options both in single-end and paired-end modes (except `--discordant-vh`). \n"
