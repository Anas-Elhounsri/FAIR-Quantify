We\nconsider non-biological information such as Cellular Barcode and Molecular\nBarcode. To later be able to extract the optional CB and the MB these are put\nin the read header, with the following format. \nThe command `umis fastqtransform` is for transforming a (pair of) read(s) to\nthis format based on a _transform file_. The transform file is a json file\nwhich has a Python flavored regular expression for each read, made to extract\nthe necessary components of the reads. \n## 2. Filtering noisy cellular barcodes\nNot all cellular barcodes identified in the transformation will be real. Some\nwill be low abundance barcodes that do not represent an actual cell. Others\nwill be barcodes that don't come from a set of known barcodes. The `umi cb_filter`\ncommand can be used to filter a transformed FASTQ file, dropping unknown\nbarcodes. The `--nedit` option can be supplied to correct barcodes `--nedit`\ndistance away from known barcodes. After barcode filtering,\nthe `umis cb_histogram` command will generate a file of counts for\neach cellular barcode. This file can be used to find a count cut-off for barcodes\nthat are high abundance for downstream quantitation. \nThis is done by pseudo-aligners, either Kallisto or RapMap. The SAM (or BAM) file output\nfrom these tools need to be saved. \nThe final step is to infer which cDNA was the origin of the tag a UMI was\nattached to. We use the pseudo-alignments to the cDNAs, and consider a tag\nassigned to a cDNA as a partial _evidence_ for a (cDNA, UMI) pairing. For\nactual counting, we only count unique UMIs for (gene, UMI) pairings with\nsufficient evidence. \nThe recommended workflow is to map reads to cDNA, in which case the target name in the BAM\nwill be a transcript ID. If the BAM has been mapped to a genome (e.g. with STAR) `tagcount`\ncan use the optional `GX` BAM tag to get the gene name. In this case, use the option `--gene_tags`.\n \n"
