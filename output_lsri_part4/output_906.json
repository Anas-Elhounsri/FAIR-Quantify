        "value": "The aim in kidney paired-donation is typically to maximize the number of transplants achieved through the exchange of donors in a pool comprising incompatible donor-candidate pairs, along with non-directed (or altruistic) donors. With many possible allocations at any given time, an optimal set of exchanges cannot be determined by simple inspection. In practice, objective criteria are used to determine an optimal or near-optimal set of exchanges to pursue.  \n\nWe present a software application for management and optimization of a kidney paired donation program, KPDGUI (Kidney Paired Donation Graphical User Interface). We implement a variety of published optimization schemes, while offering the user an interactive and visual environment. The application allows comparison of exchanges suggested under different optimization criteria, and examination of the consequences of various policies on proposed solutions. \n\nKPDGUI offers the following advantages over the most common alternatives:\n\n1. An interactive visual display of the current state of the KPD program.\n2. Implementation of optimization methods from previous literature[5,6], which can be used to account for (a) probabilities that preferred transplants are unviable either due to positive crossmatch or through the unavailability of a candidate or donor in the exchange, and (b) fallback options for immediate recourse in case potential exchanges are unable to proceed as determined due to unviability.\n3. Optimization is extended beyond selection of simple cycles or chains to more general subsets of pairs, possibly with more than one associated incompatible donor, and NDDs that facilitate fallback options in the case of unviability[7].\n\n\n"
