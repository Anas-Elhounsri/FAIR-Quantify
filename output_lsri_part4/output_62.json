This program is an interface to one of the most popular MD codes ([Amber](http://ambermd.org/)), aiding users in preparing and running their own simulations. \nThe idea behind MDMS design is that the beginnings should be easy - not exhausting. That is why this program accommodates everything that is required for getting realistic insights about protein/protein-ligand complexes through MD simulations. \nProgram's execution has four distinct steps:\n- establishing protein/protein-ligand complex structure\n- preparing topology and coordinate files for Amber\n- preparing input files for Amber\n- running MD simulations \nMDMS is aimed both to newcomers to the field as well as mature scientists. Newcomers will mostly benefit from the ease of starting MD simulations and the guarantee that the systems are constructed correctly (if user will carefully follow on-screen prompts). Mature scientists should mostly appreciate time savings - with MDMS, MD simulations of the proteins might be initiated as quickly as in 2 minutes from the start of the program. \n"
