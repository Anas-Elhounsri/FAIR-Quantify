Current\n              whole-genome clustering and multilocus typing approaches do not\n              fully exploit core and accessory genomic variation, and they\n              cannot both automatically identify, and subsequently expand,\n              clusters of significantly similar isolates in large data sets\n              spanning entire species. Here, we describe PopPUNK (Population\n              Partitioning Using Nucleotide K -mers), a software implementing\n              scalable and expandable annotation- and alignment-free methods\n              for population analysis and clustering. Variable-length k-mer\n              comparisons are used to distinguish isolates' divergence in\n              shared sequence and gene content, which we demonstrate to be\n              accurate over multiple orders of magnitude using data from both\n              simulations and genomic collections representing 10 taxonomically\n              widespread species. Connections between closely related isolates\n              of the same strain are robustly identified, despite interspecies\n              variation in the pairwise distance distributions that reflects\n              species' diverse evolutionary patterns. PopPUNK can process\n              103-104 genomes in a single batch, with minimal memory use and\n              runtimes up to 200-fold faster than existing model-based methods.\n              Clusters of strains remain consistent as new batches of genomes\n              are added, which is achieved without needing to reanalyze all\n              genomes de novo. This facilitates real-time surveillance with\n              consistent cluster naming between studies and allows for outbreak\n              detection using hundreds of genomes in minutes. Interactive\n              visualization and online publication is streamlined through the\n              automatic output of results to multiple platforms. PopPUNK has\n              been designed as a flexible platform that addresses important\n              issues with currently used whole-genome clustering and typing\n              methods, and has potential uses across bacterial genetics and\n              public health research.\",\n  journal  = \"Genome Res.\",\n  volume   =  29,\n  number   =  2,\n  pages    = \"304--316\",\n  month    =  jan,\n  year     =  2019,\n  language = \"en\"\n}\n"

If you need backwards compatibility the previous version can still be run by specifying `--use-mash`.\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n* Use [pp-sketchlib](https://github.com/johnlees/pp-sketchlib) as the backend. This is ~2x faster for sketching and 50-100x faster for distance calculations. Databases are ~1/4 of the size.\r\n* Input data is now formatted as a tab separated file with name followed by any associated sequence. Sample names no longer have to be filenames. (Closes #43, #46)\r\n* Read data can now be handled, including a filter to remove k-mers containing sequencing errors\r\n* Faster database edits with `prune_db` and `reference_pick`\r\n* Ability to use the previous sketching method and databases by specifying `--use-mash`\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n* Better error handling when creating visualisations, so output files are still produced if this fails",
