In PETs, a new sampling strategy is proposed to ensure and improve the stability of predictor, features are used to divide training dataset into sub datasets, these datasets would be clustered through k-means, and the samples could be selected based the distance. Through this kind of sampling, samples which have different types of significant features could be selected uniformly. The performance shows that PETs has better results and keeps a good stability.\n"

Please be sure the name of file is 'myDataset.out.acc20'.\n- Folder 'PSA': This feature could be available at http://lee.kias.re.kr/~newton/sann/, and please be sure that the name of file is like '1AK4A.prsa' (the name and chain use both upper words).\n- Folder 'PSS': This feature could be also available at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/, and its off-line version could be obtained at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/explanation.html#SSpro. The rule of name is the same as 'PRSA' but the suffix is '.out.ss'.\n- Folder 'PSSM': This feature is available at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi, I think this the only one which I don't need to explain in details. But make sure that the name of file is like '1ak4_A' (the name uses lower words and the chain uses upper words, and '_' is used to divide).\n\nStep 3: Just run 'PETs_ez2use', and a complete report could be available in folder 'result' for each protein.\n\nTips: These folders are in 'YourDatasetHere', DO NOT MODIFY THE FOLDERS IN THE ROOT OF PROJECT!\n"
