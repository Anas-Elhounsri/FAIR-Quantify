        "value": "Q. What is \"average density\" that agpdraw-line reports?\n\nA. The area under the curve in plot makes group-averaged read/peak number. The \"density\" was defined so that the area under the (smoothed) curve makes total aggregated read/peak numbers. agplus reports the averaged densities over group members which is defined in the reference and assignment files. Please note that the read count is RPM (Read Per Million) normalized when you use bam2bwshifted.\n\n\nQ. Can agplus aggregate **peaks** (not raw reads)?\n\nA. Yes. agplus can accepts peak-called file (BED or BED-like format) after reformatting. For example, peaks were recorded in `peaks.bed` file:\n\n```\nawk -v OFS=\"\\t\" '{print $1,$2,$3,1}' peaks.bed > peaks.wig\n```\n\nand give \"peaks.wig\" as the target file of agplus. In this case, \"average density\" of the plot can be regarded as \"average peak detection rate\".\n\nIf the peaks file contains a score column (tag-count, p-value, fold-enrichment, etc.) and you would like to calculate average of the scores, you can replace `{print $1,$2,$3,1}` to `{print $1,$2,$3,$7}` if you want to use the 7th column of the original BED file as the score.\n\nWe recommend using the peak summits file as target/reference file if available. Using peak summits could improve accuracy/resolution of signal source positioning. \n\n\nQ. How to change the look of the plot (colors, line widths, drawing range of y-axis).\n\nA. We recommend using your own line drawing software to change the looks freely. The output file of agplus is a simple text table and thus can be easily imported into any software, e.g. MS Excel, gnuplot, R, Matlab (or you can directly edit the output PDF by vector graphics software like Adobe's Illustrator). \n\nPlease note that the line-smoothing function is part of agpdraw-line and thus is not done by agplus. We provided agpdraw-line as a visual example of agplus output and consider it is sufficient in most cases.\n\n"
