        "description": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### Important CRAM writing bug fix\r\nA serious bug which can cause corrupted reads in CRAM files was discovered and fixed in this release. This bug was introduced in HTSJDK 3.0.0, and affects Picard versions 2.27.3 through 3.1.1 and GATK versions 4.3 through 4.5.\r\n\r\nThe bug occurs in cases where there is a read aligned starting at exactly position 1 on a reference contig.  This means that the bug doesn't generally impact human autosome and X/Y contigs because they tend to start with a large number of `N` bases and reads are not aligned at exactly position 1.  The exceptions to this would be T2T references and things like mitochondrial calling. \r\n\r\nFor more information on the conditions that trigger this bug, see [this post](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/issues/8768#issuecomment-2198315437).\r\n\r\n[GATK 4.6](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases/tag/4.6.0.0) includes a tool called `CRAMIssue8768Detector` that can scan a CRAM file and report whether it is affected, and if so which regions in the file are corrupt. If you suspect that some of your CRAM files may have been affected, please run this tool on them for confirmation!\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk/pull/1708 for more information.\r\n\r\n### Better support for remote files\r\nImprovements to allow direct access to remote files continue.  It's now possible to use a remote reference file without localizing it in many cases.  Files which are available through http URLs are now accessible directly as well.  (ex:  `https://example.com/my.bam`). This allows direct access to signed URLs, although index and supporting files may not be discoverable automatically.\r\n* Enable use of cloud reference files by @cmnbroad in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1804\r\n* Adding http-nio as a dependency by @lbergelson in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1929\r\n\r\n### New features for flow based reads\r\n* MarkDuplicates strategy of flow based reads that looks only at the qualities close to the end of the read by @ilyasoifer in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1942\r\n* CollectQualityYieldMetricsFlowSpace tool by @dror27 in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1932\r\n\r\n### New Options\r\n* `KEEP_ZERO_LENGTH_INTERVALS` flag  when converting bed -> interval_list by @rickymagner in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1928\r\n* Make the `VCF` option in CollectSamErrorMetrics optional. by @nh13 in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1476\r\n* Add the `EXT` argument to CollectSamErrorMetrics. by @nh13 in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1478\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes\r\nBug fixes to several tools as well as important CRAM fixes from an updated htsjdk\r\n* MarkDuplicates: Add read group ID instead of string \"RG\" by @michaelgatzen in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1937\r\n* Fix CollectHSMetrics - Don't use Coverage Cap on fold score by @JoeVieira in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1913\r\n* Fix for order flipping in SortingCollection used for MarkDuplicates by @wook-choi in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1945\r\n* Allow fingerprinting of SAM files that only have a partial dictionary match to the haplotype map by @yfarjoun in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1955\r\n* Fix a bug in the liftover logic by @yfarjoun in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1956\r\n\r\n### Documentation and improved error messages\r\n* Reject piped input (/dev/stdin) for BedToIntervalList by @kockan in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1918\r\n* Update AbstractAlignmentMerger.java Warning Message for Cross Species Contamination by @gokalpcelik in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1960\r\n* MergeBamAlignment documentation by @kachulis in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1922\r\n* Updated SamToFastq documentation by @kockan in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1920\r\n\r\n### Maintenance and dependency updates\r\n* Update setup_gcloud github action by @lbergelson in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1939\r\n* Update Dockerfile and build_push_docker.sh by @lbergelson in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1921\r\n* Update Gradle to 8.5 by @lbergelson in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1930\r\n* Convert to use the java-library plugin by @lbergelson in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1934\r\n* update htsjdk to 4.1.1 by @lbergelson in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1967\r\n* Update http-nio to 1.1.1 by @droazen in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1968\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @JoeVieira made their first contribution in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1913\r\n* @wook-choi made their first contribution in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1945\r\n* @dror27 made their first contribution in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1932\r\n* @gokalpcelik made their first contribution in https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1960\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/compare/3.1.1...3.2.0",

The default picard jar now includes the necessary libraries to read from google cloud buckets.    This is part of an ongoing push to cloud enable more of the important picard tools.  It will reduce confusion and simplify code.  \r\n   * cloud jar is now default jar https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1900\r\n   * IntervalListTools is cloud enabled https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1852\r\n   * updated google nio library which supports `_` in bucket names https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1903\r\n   * new test infrastructure for writing tests that use google cloud https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1860\r\n\r\n### IntelGKL update\r\nA new version \r\n   * A new [version of the Intel GKL](https://github.com/Intel-HLS/GKL/releases/tag/0.8.11) library fixes several major bugs. https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1901\r\n   * A bug fix which enables the IntelInflater which was accidentally being ignored.  https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/pull/1885\r\n\r\n### Dependency and Gradle Updates\r\n  * Updated dependencies to their latest versions to incorporate security and bug fixes.\r\n  * Updated to gradle 8.2.1\r\n \r\n### Notes\r\n   * Downstream toolkits will have to make some changes if they want to continue to NOT provide the google cloud libraries.  \r\n   * Updating to gradle 8.2.1 was necessitated by a packaging issue.  One of the updated dependencies now includes java 19 code in it's multi-version jar and we needed to update to the newest version of the shadowJar plugin in order to handle it.
