Due to the contribution of naturally occurring isotopes and isotopic impurity from the tracer, the fractional abundances of measured isotopologues (FAM) collected from the instrument must be corrected to obtain mass distribution vectors (MDV) that correspond to the contribution from isotopic labeling. ElemCor is based on the correction matrix (Ref. 1) and uses two different approaches to account for resolution effect, mass different theory (Ref. 2), and unlabeled samples (Ref. 3). ElemCor corrects and improves the numerical schemes of both methods (Ref. 4).  \n"

The final results include, MDV, enrichment, and fold change of pool size for different compounds and samples.   \nFAM typically has a length of Nt + 1 to cover M+0, M+1, ..., M+Nt isotopologues. Here Nt stands for the number of tracer atoms. But ElemCor is able to handle FAM that has a length other than Nt + 1, and the answer is Yes.  \n3. What is the advantage of ElemCor over IsoCor? \nIsoCor performs correction based on combinatorics without considering ressolution effect. When instrument resolution is extremely low, ElemCor is identical to IsoCor. When instrument resolution is extremely high, ElemCor performs no correction at all. Therefore, the amount of correction perform by ElemCor is monotonically dependent on instrument resolution.  \n4. What is the expected processing time? \nThe example files shown in Fig. 2 can be processed within 10 seconds on a 2.6GHz Core i7 processor, and 20 seconds on a 1.5GHz Core i5 processor. If the results do not come out within a minute, please check whether the correct tracer is selected, as the warning message suggests. If the 15N data are loaded, but C or S is selected as tracer, then the software tool would not run properly. This is because some compounds may not have C or S in their formula, and the algorithm will report error if the tracer element is not present in the compound.\n \n"

To build the software, simply click on the project file \u201celemcor.prj\u201d. All other files required to run the software are automatically identified if they are placed under the same directory as the project file (Fig. 1).
