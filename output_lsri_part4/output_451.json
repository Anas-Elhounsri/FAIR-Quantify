To run the following example, follow these steps:\n\n1. Double check that the 3 directories provided in the archive are in the same directory. \n\n2. The included file \u2018RunVars.csv\u2019 in the data directory specifies the parameters that apply to all species that can be changed and used in a sample CDMetaPOP run. Open \u2018RunVars.csv\u2019 in your editor of choice. A spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, allows for easy editing of the tabular values. The 'PopVars' file location(s) (one for each species in the simulation) are specified in the first column.\n\n3. The various \u2018PopVars\u2019 files define the patch files in the first column. The included files \u2018PatchVars\u2019 files will also be in the same folder (../data/patchvars). \u2018ClassVars\u2019 files are in turn specified in the \u2018PatchVars\u2019 files and example \u2018ClassVars\u2019 files will be in the ../data/classvars/ folder. \n\n4. There will be 3 lines of information in \u2018RunVars.csv\u2019: a header line and 5 lines of information corresponding to 5 separate, single-species CDMetaPOP runs (batches). See Table 1 in user manual which contains a breakdown for each column header and the parameters that can be changed. The \u2018Input\u2019 in the table listed is for the first row in the file. Make sure you save this file in the same format \u2013 a comma delimited file \u2013 when you make changes to the parameters. Do not change the \u2018Input\u2019 (first row) labeling. Select \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018OK\u2019 for any Excel questions about saving in this format. 'RunVars_multispecies.csv' provides example inputs for 2 species, and 'RunVars_3species.csv' provides example inputs for 3 species.\n\n5. Start the program: For example, if you use python from the command line, then open a terminal window and change your shell directory to the CDMetaPOP src home directory (i.e., > cd C:\\\"homedirectorylocation\"\\src). \n\n6. Run the program: There are a number of ways to run this program. If you are using a command shell you can run the program by typing \u201cpython CDMetaPOP.py C:/\u201dhomedirectorylocation\u201d/data RunVars.csv output_test\u201d. Or a short-cut if your data is located at the same folder level as the src folder: \u201cpython CDMetaPOP.py ../data/ PopVars.csv output_test\u201d. Note that there are 5 arguments here that must be included with spaces in between: \n\na.\t\u201cpython\u201d starts python, for example from the command line. Note that other python environments may have different calls here. In iPython (the IDE distributed with Anaconda) the call is \u201crun\u201d. \nb.\t\u201cCDMetaPOP.py\u201d runs CDMetaPOP program.\nc.\t\u201cC:/\u201dhomedirectorylocation\u201d/data\u201d is the directory location of the input test files. You can point this directory to other project files, for example. We suggest not having any spaces in your directory names. So as projects accumulate you can rename input folders that contain the project specific files (e.g., dataWestslope or dataBullTrout).\nd.\t\u201cRunVars.csv\u201d is the parameter file (comma delimited) which can be renamed (e.g., \u201cRunVars_WCT.csv\u201d). Caution should be taken when going between operating systems and saving this file as a .csv.\ne.\t\u201coutput_test\u201d is the name of the directory that will be created with CDMetaPOP output in the directory specified by the third argument above.\n\n7. Check for successful model run completion: The program will provide step-by-step output in the Shell window. Each row of RunVars.csv will be repeated for each line in PopVars.csv. Once completed, a simulation time will be printed out and folders run0batch0mc0, run0batch0mc1,  run0batch1mc0, etc. will be created in your CDMetaPOP home directory to store output from the separate batch and/or Monte-Carlo runs (each line in the RunVars file corresponds to a separate 'run' and each line in the PopVars file corresponds to a separate 'batch'. Monte Carlo runs are specified by 'mc'). These folders are located in the data folder specified in above step. The output folder will have a unique date/time stamp after the name of the output folder in case you want to run multiple CDMetaPOP runs in this same directory. The program will also provide a log file with program steps in your specified output directory. If parameters are such that all species become extinct before the specified generation time, the program will end. The program will provide error and feedback for parameters that are outside of ranges or incorrectly entered.\n\nHappy Simulations!\n\nErin.\n\nContact Information\nErin Landguth\nComputational Ecology Laboratory\nThe University of Montana\n32 Campus Drive\nMissoula MT, 59812-1002\nerin.landguth@mso.umt.edu\n"
