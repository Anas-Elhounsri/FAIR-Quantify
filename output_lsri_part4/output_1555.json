It combines the traditional features of parallelization-enabled workflow management systems and of distributed computing platforms in a container-based approach, while it offers seamless deployment, overcoming the burden of setting up and configuring the software and network requirements. Most importantly, Hermes guarantees the reproducibility of research by enforcing standardization of the execution environment, thus leading to consistent scientific results, cultivating collaboration between scientists and accelerating scientific output.\n \n"

In this case you need to cancel (ctrl-c) and re-run the workflow.\n* Sometimes the autodetect ip module might fail due to a network error, cancel (ctrl-c) and re-run the workflow\n* As the test workflows are cpu-intensive, when both the Hermes master and worker container are executed on a site with very limited resources (less than 2 cores) the workflow may stall, although this is rare. In that case please restart and re-run. No step should take a significant amount of time (more than a few minutes) while at the same time cpu usage must be high.\n"

To install docker visit: https://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/\nIn case your user on site is unable to access the Docker daemon, have a system administrator execute the following command: sudo usermod -aG docker <user_name>\n\n* SSH server must be up and running on all sites you plan to execute on and password-less access via SSH keys must be enabled. All sites must be accessible through the same SSH key which must NOT be protected by a password (passphrase). To setup password-less SSH access follow this guide: http://www.tecmint.com/ssh-passwordless-login-using-ssh-keygen-in-5-easy-steps/\nYou should be able to connect to the localhost and all other provided sites passwordless. To test accessing the local site, run the command ssh <user_name>@localhost. You should be able to connect without any password prompt.\n\n* You must also install Java Oracle version 8 on all sites. \n"

The results of the workflow can be found in a folder in your home folder named hermes_workflow_results followed by the current date.\n\nIn case you want to run a different workflow, the first provided argument is the path to the .graphml workflow description file, while the second argument is the path to the workflow inputs folder. Both paths are ABSOLUTE paths and do not include any bash supported characters like ~ or .\n\nFor example, in order to run the also provided phylogenetic profiles workflow, the command would be:\n\n* java -jar ./Hermes/dist/Hermes.jar pathToWorkflowFile pathToInputsFolder\n\nThe paths must be absolute, not relative. A sample command would be\n\n* java -jar ./Hermes/dist/Hermes.jar /home/user/hermes/WorkflowGraphs/phylogenetic_profiles.graphml /home/user/hermes/WorkflowSampleInputs/SmallSampleInput/\n\nThis command will run the phylogenetic profiles workflow (assuming that the paths are valid for your file system) by using the provided SmallSampleInput dataset.\n\nIn case you want to run a larger analysis, you can use the input dataset located in the WorkflowSampleInputs/ExtendedSampleInput folder.\n"
