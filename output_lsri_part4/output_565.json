        "value": "Here, we will use the test files to provide an example of how to use GPress. We will use GTF file for illustration since the GFF3 file is nearly the same except slight format variations. We will store the compressed GTF file and compressed expression file in a new folder **gtf1**\n1. To compress the GTF file without random access, run\n```\n./gpress -cw data/test_gtf.gtf gtf1\n```\nThe compressed file is stored named **GTF_compressed_without.tar** in folder **gtf1**.\n\n2. To decompress the GTF file from folder **gtf1** without random access, run \n```\n./gpress -dc gtf gtf1\n```\nThe decompressed GTF is stored named **decompressed_gtf.gtf** in folder **output**.\n\n3. To compress the GTF with random access (500 genes per block), run \n```\n./gpress -c 500 data/test_gtf.gtf gtf1\n```\nThe compressed GTF file is stored named **GTF_compressed.tar** in folder **gtf1**.\nThe associated index tables are also stored in folder **gtf1**.\n\n4. To do single id search on compressed GTF file from folder **gtf1**, run\n```\n./gpress -q -id ENSE00003486434.1 gtf1\n```\nThe retrieved information will be printed in command window by default.\n\nIn order to also print out the parents and children of the searched item from folder **gtf1**, run\n```\n./gpress -q -id -f ENSE00003486434.1 gtf1\n```\nThe searched item, its parents and its children will all be printed in command window by default. \n\n5. To do multiple id searches on compressed GTF file from folder **gtf1**, run\n```\n./gpress -q -id gtf1\n```\nThen enter the exon id \"ENSE00003486434.1\" in the command window, the retrieved information will be printed in command window.\nIf the user also wants to know all this exon's parents and children contained in the gene, enter \"yes\" in the command window. Finally, hit \"quit\" to terminate the program.\n\n6. To do range search on chromosome 1 with range from 10000 to 100000:\n```\n./gpress -q -range 10000 100000 1 gtf1 \n```\nThe retrieved information is printed in command window.\n\n7. To compress and link the expression file with GFF files in folder **gtf1** (500 genes per block), \n```\n./gpress -e 500 data/test_expression.tsv gtf1\n```\nThe compressed file is stored named **expression_compressed.tar** in folder **gtf1**.\n\n8. To do id search on compressed expression file from folder **gtf1**,\n```\n./gpress -qe ENST00000009530.11 gtf1 \n```\nThe retrieved information is printed in command window.\n\nWhile parsing the expression file, GPress store all the IDs of the same item from multiple databases. For example, \n```\n./gpress -qe OTTHUMT00000374178.1 gtf1 \n```\nwill retrieve same item as above.\n\nGPress will also print the extra information if the searched item exists in the compressed GFF file. For example, \n```\n./gpress -qe ENST00000531822.1 gtf1 \n```\nwill give information from both GTF and expression files in command window.\n\n9. To do range search on chromosome 1 with range from 100000 to 100000000 on compressed expression file based on compressed GFF file from folder **gtf1**,\n```\n./gpress -qer 100000 100000000 1 gtf1\n```\nThe items on chromosome 1 with range from 100000 to 100000000 that exist in both GFF files and expression file are retrieved.\n\nBy default, the outputs are printed on the command window.\n\n10. To compress and link the sparse expression matrix file in folder **gtf1** (500 genes per block), \n```\n./gpress -sparse 500 data/matrix.mtx data/genes.tsv data/barcodes.tsv gtf1\n```\nThe compressed sparse matrix files are stored named **sparse_compressed.tar** in folder **gtf1**.\n\n11. To do id search on compressed sparse sparse matrix file from folder **gtf1**,\n```\n./gpress -qs ENSG00000242485 gtf1\n```\nGPress will also print the extra information if it exists in GFF file.\n\nBy default, the outputs are printed in the command window. \n\n12. To do range search on chromosome 1 with range from 1000 to 1000000 on compressed sparse matrix file based on compressed GFF file from folder **gtf1**,\n```\n./gpress -qsr 1000 1000000 1 gtf1\n```\nThe items on chromosome 1 with range from 1000 to 1000000 that exist in both GFF files and sparse matrix files are retrieved.\n\nBy default, the outputs are printed in the command window.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
