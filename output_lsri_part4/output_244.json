Two files, namely `Sample.csv` and `Reference.csv`, will be automatically generated by `pre-process.R`. Then it is ready for us to run `SCORE.py`, which will take the above 2 files as the input files to infer the cell composition in the our samples. \n\nAfter running `SCORE.py`, three output files will be generated, including `score.csv`, `bar.pdf` and `boxplot.dpf`. `score.csv` provides the inferred fractions of the 8 types of immune cells. `bar.pdf` and `boxplot.pdf` provide the visualization of the inferred cell fractions.\n\nIn order to allow for a quick trial of this method by the users, we provide an example file, `example_expression_profile.csv`, which can be used as the input file to infer the cell composition in the sample.\n"
