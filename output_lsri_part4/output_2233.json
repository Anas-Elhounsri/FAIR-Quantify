        "value": "Major applications of RNA-seq data include studies of how the transcriptome is modulated at the levels of gene expression and RNA processing, and how these events are related to cellular identity, environmental condition, and/or disease status. While many excellent tools have been developed to analyze RNA-seq data, these generally have limited efficacy for annotating 3' UTRs. Existing assembly strategies often fragment long 3' UTRs ( illustrated below, left), and importantly, no _de-novo_ (reference annotation independent) transcript assembly of the algorithms in popular use can identify tandem 3' UTR isoforms generated by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) using only RNA-seq data (below, right). Consequently, it is often not possible to identify patterns of differential APA using existing transcript assembly tools.  \nTo address these limitations, we have developed Isoform Structural Change Model (IsoSCM),  a new method for transcript assembly that incorporates change-point analysis to improve the 3' UTR annotation process. If we assume that sequenced reads are distributed proportional to isoform abundance, the boundaries of transcription will be marked by a change in the level of coverage. In instances where short and long isoforms are co-expressed there can be a \u201cstep-like\u201d pattern of coverage at the boundary of the nested exon model. To identify terminal exon boundaries, we thus seek _change-points_ that mark transitions in RNA-seq coverage, as illustrated below. \nReal RNA-seq data contains biases that can cause the sampling of reads across the transcript body to deviate from a uniform distribution. These biases typically cause short segments of the transcript to be sequenced at a lower frequency than the rest of the transcript, resulting in a local drop in the level of coverage. The conventional (unconstrained) change-point detection procedure identifies these local drops in coverage as distinct segments. However, in the context of annotating transcripts we wish to disregard these local aberrations as they do not correspond to terminal exon boundaries. In order to minimize the effect of local biases on transcript model inference we introduce additional constraints to distinguish localized changes from change-points that mark a sustained decrease in the level of coverage. The difference between constrained and unconstrained formulations is contrasted using a toy example below.  \nWe estimate relative usage of a polyadenylation site by considering the read density in the segments up and downstream of a change-point, such that  \nwhere cov<sub>dn/up</sub> are estimates of read density downstream/upstream of a change point. In addition to identifying change-points that mark the boundaries of 3'UTRs, IsoSCM can also be used to estimate the relative usage of 3'UTR isoforms, and identify sites with differential usage between two conditions. Conveniently, the change-point detection framework used by IsoSCM can also be used to identify differential usage of tandem 3' UTRs between two samples by performing a joint segmentation, as illustrated below.  \nThe resulting joint segmentation can be used to quantitate differential usage of tandem 3'UTR isoforms. For the example shown above we can calculate _cov<sub>up</sub>_ and _cov<sub>dn</sub>_, the level of coverage in the segments up and downstream of the identified change-point, and use these quantities to define differential site usage in each tissue: \n"

The first file ([dir]/[basename].gtf) will contain all assembled loci that are inferred to contain at least one splice junction. Each line of this file represents either an _exon_ or a _splice-juction_, as specified in the 3rd column. Each feature in assembly GTF file will also have attributes for a \"locus_id\". All exons that either overlap, or are connected by splice junctions are assigned a common locus_id. For convenience, exons are assigned an additional attribute \"type\" which represents the relative order of that exon in the transcript model, which can be one of \"3p_exon\", \"5p_exon\", or \"internal_exon\". It's important to keep in mind that the transcript model may be fragmented, especially in the case of low-coverage genes. If the assembled transcript model is fragmented these assignments of 3p_exon or 5p_exon will be incorrect. Conversely, if two genes are very proximally located they may instead be innapropriately merged by the assembly process.  \nThe format of this file is the same as the GTF representing spliced transcript models. An important thing to keep in mind when analyzing reads generated using unstranded sequencing protocols is that the strandedness of assembled transcripts is inferred from reads containing splice junctions. To represent this ambiguity, the transcribed segments reported in this file will have with a strand of '.' when assembling unstranded reads. \nwill be generated. These files will be the same as the two other GTF files, except that each exon will have an associated \"coverage\" value, representing a rough estimate of read density over that exon. The coverage represents the median read coverage over each segment of the exon. This quantity is not intended to be used a rigorous metric isoform abundance, but rather as an aid to quickly identify exon models supported by less evidence.\n \n"
