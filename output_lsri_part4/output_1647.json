Sequences should be quality filtered/trimmed/denoised using your preferred quality control methods before processing with Ananke. The required sequence file contains all sequences with the sample ID in the FASTA header, followed by a sequence count. Sequences must be on a single line. For example:\n```\n>Sample1_0\nATGCGCATGCTATGCAT\n>Sample1_1\nATCGAGCATCGATCGAC\n>Sample2_0\nAGCGATCGATCGATCGAT\n...\n```\nIf your FASTA file has sequences split into multiple lines, the clever guys who made [SWARM](https://github.com/torognes/swarm#linearization) have a little awk script to convert it to the required format:\n```\nawk 'NR==1 {print ; next} {printf /^>/ ? \"\\n\"$0\"\\n\" : $1} END {printf \"\\n\"}' amplicons.fasta > amplicons_linearized.fasta\n```\n\nThe metadata file is a tab-separated sheet with the first column label as \"#SampleID\" and one of the metadata columns must contain the time offset. The metadata file from a QIIME analysis is compatible:\n```\n#SampleID time_points\nSample1 0\nSample2 1\nSample3 5\nSample4 10\n...\n```\nNote that you may only have one sample per time-point.\n"

You should find the number of clusters (which are printed to screen during computation) increases to a point, and begins decreasing. This should occur well before *eps*=100, but the clustering will halt once *eps* is large enough that everything is clustered into one group.

The labels in this file will match up with the labels used in the time-series database, allowing the information to be properly merged. The unique sequence file has size information contained in the FASTA header to enable it to work with clustering software like USEARCH/UPARSE. This must be removed from the resulting taxonomy and OTU cluster files by using sed: `sed -i 's/;size=[0-9]*;//g' taxonomy.txt`\n\nA more thorough example of how to do this is given [in the wiki](https://github.com/beiko-lab/ananke/wiki/Generating-OTUs-and-taxonomy-for-import-into-ananke).\n\n*ananke add taxonomy -i hdf5_input -d taxonomy_data*\n*ananke add sequence_clusters -i hdf5_input -d sequence_cluster_data*:\n- -**i**: input HDF5 database file location\n- -**d**: data file (e.g., tax_assignments.txt for taxonomy, or seq_otus.txt for sequence clusters)\n\nExamples:\n```\nananke add taxonomy -i ananke_db_filtered.h5 -d seq.unique_tax_assignments.txt\nananke add sequence_clusters -i ananke_db_filtered.h5 -d seq_otus.txt\n```\n\nIf you already have an OTU clustering scheme you would like to use, it must be translated so that the labels are consistent. For this, you require the sequence FASTA file that you used as input to your clustering pipeline, and the resulting OTU cluster file (in QIIME's tab-separated format, see Output section here: http://qiime.org/scripts/pick_otus.html). The output of this script can be used as the input to `ananke add sequence_clusters`.\n\n*ananke translate_clusters -i fasta_input -c clusters_input -o clusters_output*\n- -**i**: input FASTA file used to generate your clusters\n- -**c**: input clustering scheme in tab-separated format (same format as QIIME outputs)\n- -**o**: desired output cluster file name\n\nExample:\n```\nananke translate_clusters -i seq.fasta -c seq_otus.txt -o seq_otus_translated.txt\n```\n"
