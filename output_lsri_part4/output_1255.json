This pipeline aims at filling the gap in software for analysis of UMI-tagged data. \nMAGERI implements consensus assembly, alignment and variant calling and allows to process \ndatasets into ready SAM and VCF files in a single command. Its main purpose is to analyze targeted region genome re-sequencing data for tumor heterogeneity and circulating tumor DNA studies, however it can be also applied to other tasks that require accurate rare variant detection. \nSee [mageri-paper repository](https://github.com/mikessh/mageri-paper) for examples and supplementary data. \nSoftware binaries can be found in the [releases section](https://github.com/mikessh/mageri/releases/latest), the documentation is available [here](http://mageri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \n"
