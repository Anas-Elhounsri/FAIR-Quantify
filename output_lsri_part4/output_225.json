Space to hold the uncompressed sequences on the datastores on disk will also be required. \nInstalling SDG releases\n####################### \n**Notice: this refers to older release version of SDG, we are preparing the new version for release and will update this page soon. In the meantime, please use these instructions with the release code.** \nSDG can be installed via pre-compiled binaries from https://github.com/bioinfologics/sdg/releases. The binaries have been built using Python3 and GCC version 6 from the Ubuntu package manager for the Linux version. The MacOS version dependencies were obtained using Homebrew (Python3, GCC-6 and SWIG). \nCompiling the release versions requires the following dependencies: \n- GCC 6+\n- CMake 3.14.3+\n- Python 3.7+ (For Python interface)\n- Git LFS (For tests) \nThe installation process consists of generating the configuration files using CMake and using make. By default make install will install to system wide directories, to specify a different directory use `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.13/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html#cmake-install-prefix>`_. \n    wget https://github.com/bioinfologics/sdg/archive/v1.0_rc8.tar.gz\n    cd sdg-1.0_rc8\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake -DBUILD_SIMPLE_PYTHON_INTERFACE=on ../\n    make\n    make test\n    make install \nPlease refer to the publication: https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1490/v1. \n"
