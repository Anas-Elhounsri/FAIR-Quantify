        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "As it encounters each chromosome, `mosdepth` creates an array the length of the chromosome.\nFor every start it encounters, it increments the value in that position of the array. For every\nstop, it decrements that position. From this, the depth at a particular position is the\ncumulative sum of all array positions preceding it (a similar algorithm is used in BEDTools\nwhere starts and stops are tracked separately). `mosdepth` **avoids double-counting\noverlapping mate-pairs** and it **tracks every aligned part of every read using the CIGAR\noperations**. Because of this data structure, the the coverage `distribution` calculation\ncan be done without a noticeable increase in run-time. The image below conveys the concept: \nThis array accounting is very fast. There are no extra allocations or objects to track and\nit is also conceptually simple. For these reasons, it is faster than `samtools depth` which\nworks by using the [pileup](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/pileup.shtml) machinery that\ntracks each read, each base. \nThe `mosdepth` method has some limitations. Because a large array is allocated and it is\nrequired (in general) to take the cumulative sum of all preceding positions to know the depth\nat any position, it is slower for small, 1-time regional queries. It is, however fast for\nwindow-based or BED-based regions, because it first calculates the full chromosome coverage\nand then reports the coverage for each region in that chromosome. Another downside is it uses\nmore memory than samtools. The amount of memory is approximately equal to 32-bits * longest chrom\nlength, so for the 249MB chromosome 1, it will require 1GB of memory. \n`mosdepth` is written in [nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and it uses our [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib)\nvia our nim wrapper [hts-nim](https://github.com/brentp/hts-nim/)\n \n"

        "description": "This release adds support for writing [d4](https://github.com/38/d4-format) files. See Aaron's poster [here](https://twitter.com/aaronquinlan/status/1305939059022295042)\r\n\r\n## d4 is awesome\r\n`d4` is a toolset and format written by [Hao Hou](https://github.com/38) from the [Quinlan Lab](https://quinlanlab.org). \r\n\r\n`mosdepth` provides many options while calculating depth because it is **slow to re-parse the per-base.bed.gz files**. In\r\nmany cases, it's faster to re-parse a cram file than to scan large regions from the per-base bed files. In addition, writing per-base.bed.gz has always been a bottleneck in mosdepth even after it was optimized some in last release.\r\n\r\nThis release has a static d4utils binary for linux below that will allow users to manipulate d4 files.\r\n\r\n#### d4 is much faster to write:\r\n\r\nHere are mosdepth run times on a smallish cram test-case:\r\n\r\n+ mosdepth without per-base: **5.9s**\r\n+ mosdepth with per-base bed.gz: **24.8s**\r\n+ mosdepth with per-base d4: **7.7s**\r\n\r\nNote that using `d4` output greatly mitigates the cost of writing the per-base output.\r\nWith d4  **mosdepth can write per-base output for a 23X CRAM in 2m15s**\r\n\r\n#### d4 output is much more useful.\r\n\r\nOnce the d4 file is created, it is much faster to access. [d4](https://github.com/38/d4-format) includes command line utilities to view, get stats, and manipulate d4 files. These eventually will replace much of the functionality in mosdepth like `quantize`, `histogram (dist.txt)`, `regions.bed.gz` etc since the operations are so fast.\r\n\r\n## why not bigwig\r\n\r\nI made several pull requests to Devon Ryan's excellent [BigWig library](https://github.com/dpryan79/libBigWig) to improve speed and attempt to reduce memory usage: [#41](https://github.com/dpryan79/libBigWig/pull/41), [#42](https://github.com/dpryan79/libBigWig/pull/42), [#43](https://github.com/dpryan79/libBigWig/pull/43). \r\n\r\nI also wrote a [bigwig library for nim](https://github.com/brentp/bigwig-nim) that uses libBigWig and used that to prototype bigwig output for `mosdepth`. However, bigwig output dramatically increased the memory usage in `mosdepth` such that it was not viable.\r\n\r\nWe will show in the coming manuscript (and see the [poster](https://twitter.com/aaronquinlan/status/1305939059022295042)) that `d4` is much faster to create and use than `bigwig` and results in smaller file sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "this release adds a `--fast-mode` flag that makes mosdepth almost twice as fast. It does not look at mate overlap and it doesn't look at insertion or deletion events **in the cigar** -- it will still show large deletions with coverage changes and it still skips soft clipped portions of reads. This behavior is likely desirable in many cases and will result in an additional 2X speedup.\r\n\r\n0.2.4\r\n=====\r\n+ Add optional `--include-flag` to allow counting only reads that have some bits in the specified flag set.\r\n  This will only be used rarely--e.g. to count only supplemental reads, use `-F 0 --include-flag 2048`.\r\n+ Fix case when only a single argument was given to --quantize\r\n+ add --read-groups option to allow specifying that only certain read-groups should be used in the depth calculation. (#60)\r\n+ add --fast-mode that does not look at internal cigar operations like (I)insertions or (D)eletions, but does consider soft and\r\n  hard-clips at the end of the alignment. Also does not correct for mate overlap. This makes mosdepth as much as **2X faster for \r\n  CRAM** and is likely the desired mode for people using the depth for CNV or general coverage values as drops in coverage\r\n  due to CIGAR operations are often not of interest for coverage-based analyses.\r\n",
