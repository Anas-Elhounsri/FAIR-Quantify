[[PR337](https://github.com/taborlab/FlowCal/pull/337)]\r\n- All outputs returned by `FlowCal.excel_ui.process_beads_table()` and `FlowCal.excel_ui.process_samples_table()` are now OrderedDicts. [[PR334](https://github.com/taborlab/FlowCal/pull/334)]\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n- Migrated Excel engine to `openpyxl`.

        "description": "# High-level changes\n- Improved compatibility with different FCS files.\n- Improved ability to handle high-resolution FCS data and floating-point data, and transform this data to MEF.\n- Logicle scale implemented. This is the new default for plotting.\n\n# Important code changes\n\n## Gating and plotting\n- `gate.density2d` and all simple plotting functions now include arguments `xscale`, `yscale`, and `zscale` as appropriate, to define the scale of each axis. Valid options are `'linear'`, `'log'`, and `'logicle'`. All these functions default to `logicle`.\n- Arguments `log`, `xlog`, `ylog`, and `zlog` in plotting functions are deprecated.\n\n## I/O\n- `FCSData` property `domain` has been deprecated. New function `range` returns, for each specified channel, the lower and upper bounds as specified by the FCS file.\n- `FCSData` property `hist_bin_edges` has been deprecated. New function `hist_bins` allows for dynamic generation of histogram bins using either linear, logarithmic, or logicle scaling.\n\n## MEF\n- The transformation function returned by `get_transform_fxn` is now meant to be used with data previously transformed to RFI using `transform.to_rfi()`.\n- Functions `clustering_gmm` and `selection_std` now allow for rescaling of the data before performing their operations. The default scaling is `logicle`.\n- `fit_beads_autofluorescence` now uses a model that transforms data from RFI to MEF. Previously, the model was meant to be used to transform data in raw channel numbers to MEF, when using a logarithmic amplifier. The new approach allows for transformation of data taken with linear amplifiers as well.\n",
