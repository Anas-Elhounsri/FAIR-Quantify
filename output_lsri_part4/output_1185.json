        "value": "\r\nForward genetic screens are becoming increasingly useful as approaches to unveil the complexity of cellular mechanisms. Recent introduction of mammalian haploid cells opened the possibility to perform forward genetic screens using insertional mutagenesis in mammals. Haploid cells have originally been obtained from human tumors and subsequently have been established from haploid embryos of several mammals.\r\n\r\nMutagenesis of haploid cells leads to hemizygous mutantions which ensures phenotypic exposure. This is in contrast to diploid cells, where in general two copies of each chromosome are present, and effects of mutations in specific genes can be masked by the functional copy on the second chromosome.\r\n\r\nFor screening viral gene trap vectors are commonly used as mutagens for their large mutational effect and utility for providing a sequence tag for the genomic insertion site. Large haploid mutant pools are established by viral transduction following by selection of a phenotype of interest. Subsequent identification of viral insertions that become enriched after selection can define gene mutations and pathways that contribute to the phenotype under investigation. Readout of many thousands of insertion sites has become possible by deep sequencing of DNA extracted from large cell pools using specialized Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocols.\r\n\r\nHaSAPPy performs analysis of NGS datasets form pooled haploid mammalian cell screens and is used to identify insertion locations in the whole genome, map them at the level of genes, and classify insertions according to their effects on gene function. Customizable output of all calculated parameters and ranking of candidate genes is performed. The implementation conforms to current Python programming guidelines and is open to be adapted and extended according to experimental setup. The data processing and analysis is performed by the following modules:\r\n\r\n**Modules:**\r\n - Read trimming of adaptor and low quality sequences in **Trim.py** (requires PreprocessReads)\r\n - Read alignment to PhiX control and reference genomes in **Align.py** (bowtie2, NextGenMap, or nvBowtie are required)\r\n - Identification of Independent Insertions (I.I.) in **IIDefinition.py**\r\n - Counting insertions at the genes level in **GenesDefinition.py**\r\n - Enrichment analysis in **GroupAnalysis.py**\r\n - Data presentation **Tables.py** and **DesignGeneInsertions.py**\r\n\r\n**Output**\r\nOutput of the program is written in standard .xlsx and .svg file formats and can be customized in a command script.\r\n\r\n\r"
