Please submit pull requests via the main\nsorgerlab/famplex repository: https://github.com/sorgerlab/famplex\n\nIf making additions or revisions to the CSV files\ntake care to handle quotations and newlines correctly. This allows diffs to be\nhandled correctly so changes can be reviewed. Please submit updates via pull\nrequests on Github.\n\nThe CSV files in the FamPlex repo are set up to be edited natively using\nMicrosoft Excel. The CSV files in the repo have Windows line terminators\n('\\r\\n'), and are not ragged (i.e., missing entries in a row are padded out\nwith empty strings to reach the full width of the longest row).\n\nTo preserve correct newlines, take the following steps:\n\n1. If saving from Excel (Windows or Mac OS X), save to the \"Windows Comma\n   Separated (.csv)\" format.\n\n2. If reading (or writing) the files using a Python script, use the following\n   set of csv format parameters::\n\n    csvreader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"',\n                           quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL, lineterminator='\\r\\n')\n\n3. If editing the files on Linux, post-process files using ```unix2dos``` or a\n   similar program.\n\nWhen you're done, run `tox` to verify the integrity of the updates you've\nmade and to generate new exports.\n"
