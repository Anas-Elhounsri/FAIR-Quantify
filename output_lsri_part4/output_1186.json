However, distinguishing genes containing driving mutations rather than simply passenger SSVs from a cohort sequenced cancer samples requires sophisticated computational approaches.\n20/20+ integrates many features indicative of positive selection to predict oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes from small somatic variants. \nThe features capture mutational clustering, conservation, mutation *in silico* pathogenicity scores, mutation consequence types, protein interaction network connectivity, and other covariates (e.g. replication timing).\nContrary to methods based on mutation rate, 20/20+ uses ratiometric features of mutations by normalizing for the total number of mutations in a gene. This decouples the genes from gene-level differences in background mutation rate. 20/20+ uses monte carlo simulations to evaluate the significance of random forest scores based on an estimated p-value from an empirical null distribution.\n \n"
