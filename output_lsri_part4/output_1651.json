See below for the description of the above image, reconstructed using *NiftyPET* [*]_. \nThe core routines are written in CUDA C and embedded in Python C extensions.  The scientific aspects of this software platform are covered in two open-access publications: \n- *NiftyPET: a High-throughput Software Platform for High Quantitative Accuracy and Precision PET Imaging and Analysis* Neuroinformatics (2018) 16:95. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-017-9352-y\n- *Rapid processing of PET list-mode data for efficient uncertainty estimation and data analysis* Physics in Medicine & Biology (2016). https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/61/13/N322 \n.. [*] The above dynamic transaxial and coronal images show the activity of  :sup:`18`\\ F-florbetapir during the one-hour dynamic acquisition.  Note that the signal in the brain white matter dominates over the signal in the grey matter towards the end of the acquisition, which is a typical presentation of a negative amyloid beta (Abeta) scan. \nThis project is being developed at University College London (`UCL <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/>`_). Initially, it was supported and funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (`EPSRC <https://epsrc.ukri.org/>`_) of the United Kingdom (UK).  Currently, the project is being further developed under the following funding streams: \nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of `NVIDIA Corporation <https://www.nvidia.com>`_  with the donation of the Tesla K20 and Titan X Pascal GPUs used for this research and work. \n"
