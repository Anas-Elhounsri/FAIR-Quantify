SAMSA2 installs with the NCBI RefSeq database for organism matches and uses TheSeed's SEED Subsystems database for functional annotation, including functional hierarchy information. \n"

For a complete list of Python includes and\n\tR packages, see the documentation.  \n\t\n\tThe documentation also contains links to download Trimmomatic and FLASH.\n\t\n\tSAMSA links with MG-RAST, and is currently used with version 3.6 - current as of May \n\t2016.\n```\n \nThe purpose of the SAMSA pipeline is to handle beginning-to-end metatranscriptome\nanalysis.  Starting with a raw sequenced file in fastq format, it performs cleaning\nand removal of adaptor contamination, and then aligns paired-end files (if specified).\nThe files must then be submitted to MG-RAST for annotation. \nAfter annotation is complete, the results are downloaded, aggregated into summary\nfiles, and then analyzed using R and DESeq2.  The results can be viewed in either\ngraphical or tabular format, focusing either on organism-specific activity or functional\nactivity within the sample. \nThe SAMSA pipeline is designed to run in an environment with Python and R installed.  \nIt also requires an internet connection, as annotations are currently handled by the\nMG-RAST analysis server.  Users of the SAMSA pipeline must have an MG-RAST account\nfor assigning annotations. \n"
