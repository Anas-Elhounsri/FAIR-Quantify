Variants generated by SECNVs are detected with high sensitivity and precision by tools commonly used to detect copy number variants. \nCustom codes and algorithms were used to simulate rearranged genomes.\nShort read simulation is based on the modified script of [Wessim1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624799/).\nThe error model is constructed using a modified script of [GimSIM](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-74).\nBAM file generation uses [BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/), [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) and [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/).\n"
