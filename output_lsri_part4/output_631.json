This release adds custom type annotation that checks for required columns and maps input columns to output columns using config file.\r\n2. Fusion standardization function has the ability to accept custom type input that checks for few required columns. Config file has been made optionally and can be use to map input columns with output columns. Additionally, it can also be used to generate output columns with specific header name and 'NA' as an entry (Usage: \"None\" :: \"Output_name\")\r\n3. Custom type was built on top of existing starfusion and arriba fusion framework. This version will continue to support both of these caller types with same implementation.\r\n\r\nKey takeaway:\r\n\r\n- Add capability for annotation of custom fusion input file with minimal required columns\r\n-  Add custom type annotation that checks for required columns and maps input columns to output columns using config file\r\n- Update fusion standardization function to accept custom fusion input that checks for few required columns \r\n- Config file is optional and can be use to map input columns with output columns\r\n- Custom fusion input type was built on top of existing STAR-Fusion and Arriba fusion framework. \r\n- This version will continue to support both existing caller types with same implementation\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Zenodo badge by @kgaonkar6 in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/78\r\n* Added release date for ShinyFuse in the about content section for the\u2026 by @federicomarini in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/81\r\n* templates for issues and PR by @kgaonkar6 in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/79\r\n* Road to bioc + unit-test by @federicomarini in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/88\r\n* adding dplyr::one_of by @kgaonkar6 in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/82\r\n* Unit test by @kgaonkar6 in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/87\r\n* Referring to the new location for the repo of the example data by @federicomarini in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/91\r\n* Added citation info about publication to the README file by @federicomarini in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/95\r\n* Add custom type annotations by @sakshamphul in https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/pull/97\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/compare/v0.90.0...v0.91.0",

The report can be a valuable means for persistent storage and sharing of results with colleagues. \r\n\r\n- TCGA_validation.Rmd : we analyzed a subset of (160) samples from TCGA and compared fusions retained with _annoFuse_ filtering and oncogenic prioritization to those deemed the final call set in a previously published analysis by The Fusion Analysis Working Group [PMID: 29617662](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29617662/).\r\n\r\n- putative_driver_filtering.Rmd :  we demonstrate how to use annoFuse to filter putative oncogenic fusions from a filtered fusion list followed by plotting recurrent fusions, recurrently fused genes, as well as a summary plot.\r\n\r\n- function names are now updated to be consistent snake_type\r\n\r\n- added features to get_Pfam_domain(),fusion_driver(), annotate_fusion_calls()\r\n",
