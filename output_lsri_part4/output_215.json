SEQing will automatically construct a master sequence if multiple isoforms of the gene are provided, but the individual isoform sequences have to be continuous and not spliced.

        "value": "Using the ```-adv_desc``` option it is possible to provide additional information for the genes in your dataset, which will be displayed in the \"Details\" tab. The parameter takes a single tab separated file which needs to have a header line and a column named ```gene_ids```. Another constraint is that the file should only contain one row of data per gene, thus multi value attributes such as synonyms need to be combined into one, semicolon delimited field. All other columns can have names of your choosing. Example:\n```\ngene_ids\tsynonyms\nAT1G01010\tANAC001;NAC domain containing protein 1\n```\nAs an additional feature it is possible to create subtables for complex attributes like publications. To provide author, year and title information for a gene, it is necessary to use additional comma based separations and the ```-sub_tables``` option to create a tabular view of your publication data. An example for the field in your advanced description file:\n```\ngene_ids\tpublications\nAT1G10670\tauthor1,year1,title1;author2,year2,title2\n```\nAs demonstrated, comma and semicolon delimiters can be mixed in one field. The ```-sub_tables``` option takes an additional file which describes the table for the specific attribute. The structure is consists of two tab delimited columns, one containing the attribute names of the subtables for and the other containing the semicolon delimited column headers for the table:\n```\npublications\tAuthor;Year;Title\n```\nThis file does not need a header line. Should the number of columns not match the number of comma separated entries in your advanced description file the data will be displayed as the comma separated string without a table.\n\nFinally you can use ```?``` before a value to mark it as a hyperlink:\n```\ngene_ids\text_link\nAT1G01010\t?http://araport.org\n```\nThis will also work for semicolon separated values as well as in subtables, but not in comma separated Strings.\n"

No header rows |\n|Coverage data | BEDGRAPH files conforming to the standard. No header rows |\n|Splice event data | BED6 files conforming to the standard. No header rows |\n|Basic description file | Tab separated file with 3 columns. No header. Columns are expected in order: gene_id, description, gene_name |\n|Advanced description file | Tab separated file. Has to contain a header row and a column named \"gene_ids\". All other columns can be custom |\n|Subtable file | 2 column tab separated file, first column contains column names from advanced descriptions, second column contains subtable column names separated by semicolon.

Graphs for datasets can be toggled on and off in the visualisation. Depending on the way the user does this, the order in which datasets are displayed may change. Therefore the graphs are sorted by default in ascending order using the prefix. However you might have a need for more complex sorting, like the following example:\n```\npython3 validator.py gene_annotation_file -bsraw 7pref26_iCLIP 7pref30_iCLIP \\\n-k 'lambda x : x[-2:]' 'True' -k 'lambda x : x[:1]' 'False'\n```\nThe ```-k``` parameter allows users to directly provide arguments for the ```list.sort``` function of python. In this case we provide 2 different sets of arguments, the first one sorts the prefixes by the last two characters (descending order) and the second sorts them by the first character in ascending order. Each -k has to be followed by a string containing the desired lambda expression and a boolean telling the program whether to revert the order (the default is *ascending*).\n"
