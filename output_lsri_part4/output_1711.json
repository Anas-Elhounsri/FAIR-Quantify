Run with .topo file:<br />\n    `$ ./RACIPE *.topo [options]`<br />\n    RACIPE generates two files according to the topology information (in .topo file):<br />\n    - Configure information file (.cfg file) storing all setting for simulation (can be used in the second way to run the package);<br />\n    - Parameter ranges file (.prs file) storing ranges of the parameters for randomiztion.<br /><br />\n    If the \"-flag\" option is set to 0 (default), RACIPE will calculate the results for all RACIPE models, which means \"_parameter.dat\", \"_solution_.dat\", and \"_T_test.dat\" will be generated. <br />\n    If the \"-flag\" option is set to 1, only .cfg and .prs will be generated. <br /><br />\n    Example:<br />\n    `$make`<br />\n    `$./RACIPE TS.topo [options]`<br />\n\n  2. Run with .cfg file<br />\n    `$ ./RACIPE *.cfg [options]`<br />\n    .prs file will be automatically regenerated according to the setting in .cfg file no matter old .prs file exists or not.<br />\n    To change the setting of the simulation, you can either change the .cfg file directly or use options. However, the options set in command line will always override the setting in .cfg file. New configuration file will be generated as \"_tmp.cfg\" in the same fold to store the simulation setting for the current run. <br /><br />\n    Similarily,<br />\n    If the \"-flag\" option is set to 0 (default), RACIPE will calculate the results for all RACIPE models, which means \"_parameter.dat\", \"_solution_.dat\", and \"_T_test.dat\" will be generated. <br />\n    If the \"-flag\" option is set to 1, updated configuration file will be generated as \"_tmp.cfg\" in the same fold. <br />\n"
