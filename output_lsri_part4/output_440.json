        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "HybPiper was designed for targeted sequence capture, in which DNA sequencing libraries are enriched for gene regions of interest, especially for phylogenetics. HybPiper is a suite of Python scripts/modules that wrap and connect bioinformatics tools in order to extract target sequences from high-throughput DNA sequencing reads.  \n\nTargeted bait capture is a technique for sequencing many loci simultaneously based on bait sequences. The HybPiper pipeline starts with high-throughput sequencing reads (for example from Illumina MiSeq), and assigns them to target genes using BLASTx/DIAMOND or BWA. The reads are distributed to separate directories, where they are assembled separately using SPAdes. The main output is a FASTA file of the (in frame) CDS portion of the sample for each target region, and a separate file with the translated protein sequence. \nHybPiper also includes commands to extract the intronic regions flanking each exon, and investigate putative paralogs. For more information, [please see our wiki](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki/). \nHybPiper is run separately for each sample (single or paired-end sequence reads, with an optional file of unpaired reads in the latter scenerio). When HybPiper generates sequence \nfiles from the reads, it does so in a standardized directory hierarchy. Many of the post-processing commands rely on this directory hierarchy, so do not modify it after running the initial pipeline. It is a good idea to run the pipeline for each sample from the same directory. You will end up with one directory per run of HybPiper, and some of the later commands take advantage of this predictable directory structure. \n"

This is done on a per-sample/per-gene basis, rather than the sample-level filtering available in `hybpiper retrieve_sequences`. See [wiki](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki#hybpiper-filter_by_length) for more information. For a full list of changes see the [changelog](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/blob/master/change_log.md). \nAdded the new subcommand `fix_targetfile`. Assists with filtering target file sequences based on length and sequence complexity, and in ensuring sequences are in the correct reading frame (the latter for nucleotide target files only). For a full list of changes see the [changelog](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/blob/master/change_log.md). \nThis update involves a substantial refactor of the HybPiper pipeline, with changes to the internal code, additional functionality, and additional output. For a full list of changes see the [changelog](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/blob/master/change_log.md). \n- Fix for [Issue 41](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/issues/41) a problem in `intronerate.py` when attempting to resolve overlapping gene annotations.\n- Add support in `retrieve_sequences.py` for a list of HybPiper outputs rather than everything in a directory \n- Add support for supercontigs in `get_seq_lengths.py`\n- Remove integer requirement for `--cov_cutoff` to accommodate `auto` and `off` settings in Spades. \n"

This feature will add 10 N characters in between joined contig when recovering the supercontig. This is useful for identifying where the intron recovery fails, and for annotation processing (i.e. for GenBank). \n- Added a new version of the heatmap script, `gene_recovery_heatmap_ggplot.R`.

When using paired-end sequencing reads, a third read file may be specified with this flag. Reads will be mapped to targets separately, but will be used along with paired reads in contig assembly.\n\n- Added `--target` flag. Adds the ability to choose which of the reference sequences is used for each gene. If `--target` is a file (tab-delimited file with one gene and one target name per line), HybPiper will use that. Otherwise `--target` can be the name of one reference. HybPiper will only use targets with the specified name in the Alignment/Exon Extraction phase. All other targets for that locus will only be used in the Mapping/Read Sorting phase.\n\n- Added `--timeout` flag, which uses GNU Parallel to kill processes (i.e. Spades or Exonerate) if they take X percent longer than average. Use if there are a lot of stuck jobs (`--timeout 1000`)\n- Python 3 compatibility\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Can accommodate Solexa FASTQ paired headers\n- Fixed `spades_runner.py` not recognizing `--cpu` on redos\n- Prints more meaningful messages for some common errors\n- Can accommodate `prefix` not being in current directory\n- Deletes sorted reads on restart to prevent double counting reads.\n- `spades_runner.py` will now respect `--kvals`\n- Added initial call to log for `reads_first.py`\n\n---\n**1.1** *May, 2016*: Release associated with manuscript in *Applications in Plant Sciences*.\n\n- Added `paralog_investigator.py`, which detects and extracts long exons from putative paralogs in all genes in one sample.\n\n- Added `paralog_retriever.py`, which retrieves sequences generated by `paralog_investigator.py` for many samples (or the coding sequence generated by `exonerate_hits.py` if no paralogs are detected).\n\n- Added a test_dataset of 13 genes for 9 samples, and a shell script to run the test data through the main script and several post-processing scripts.\n\n- Fixed bug involving calling HybPiper with a relative path such as: `../reads_first.py`\n\n- `reads_first.py --check_depend` now checks for SPAdes, BWA, and Samtools\n\n- Full revision of README, which is now shorter. Full tutorials on installing and running HybPiper are now on the Wiki.\n\n\n\n**1.0** *Feb, 2016*: Initial fully-featured release associated with submission of manuscript to *Applications in Plant Sciences*.\n\n-- Sequence assembly now uses SPAdes rather than Velvet + CAP3\n\n---\n"

        "description": "- Add option `--compress_sample_folder` to command `hybpiper assemble`. Tarball and compress the sample folder after assembly has completed i.e. `<sample_name>.tar.gz`. \r\n  - This is useful when running HybPiper on HPC clusters with file number limits.\r\n  - If both an uncompressed and compressed folder exist for a sample, a warning is shown and HybPiper exits.\r\n  - All HybPiper subcommands (`stats`, `recovery_heatmap`, `retrieve_sequences`, `paralog_retriever`, `filter_by_length`) work with either compressed or uncompressed sample files/folders, or a combination of both.\r\n  - If a `<sample_name>.tar.gz` file already exists for a sample, it will be extracted and used for the current run of `hybpiper assemble`, and the `<sample_name>.tar.gz` file will be deleted.\r\n- When using BWA for read mapping, the command `samtools flagstat` is now run during the `hybpiper assemble` step, rather than during `hybpiper stats`, and the results are written to a `<sample_name>_bam_flagstat.tsv` \\ `<sample_name>_unpaired_bam_flagstat.tsv` file(s). \r\n  - If the `<sample_name>_bam_flagstat.tsv` \\ `<sample_name>_unpaired_bam_flagstat.tsv` file(s) are not present in a sample directory (i.e. the sample was assembled with HybPiper version <2.3.0), `samtools flagstat` will be run during `hybpiper stats`. If the sample is a `*.tar.gz` file, the `*.bam` file(s) will first be extracted to disk to a temporary directory called `temp_bam_files`, within your current working directory. This temporary directory will be deleted after `samtools flagstat` has been run.\r\n- Add option `--not_protein_coding` to `hybpiper assemble`. When this option is provided, sequences matching your target file references will be extracted from SPAdes contigs using BLASTn, rather than Exonerate. This should improve recovery when using a target file with non-protein-coding sequences. Note that this feature is new and might have bugs - please report any issues.\r\n  - Only nucleotide `*.FNA` sequences will be produced (i.e. no amino-acid sequences).\r\n  - Intronerate will not be run; intron and supercontig sequences will not be produced.\r\n  - If BLASTx or DIAMOND is selected for read mapping (i.e. protein vs translated-nucleotide searches), a warning will be displayed and read mapping will switch to BWA.\r\n- Add the following options to control BLASTn searches of SPAdes contigs when option `--not_protein_coding` is used:\r\n\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_task`. Task to use for blastn searches (blastn, blastn-short, megablast, dc-megablast). Default is blastn.\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_evalue`. Expectation value (E) threshold for saving hits. Default is 10.\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_word_size`. Word size for wordfinder algorithm (length of best perfect match).\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_gapopen`. Cost to open a gap.\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_gapextend`. Cost to extend a gap.\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_penalty`. Penalty for a nucleotide mismatch.\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_reward`. Reward for a nucleotide match.\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_perc_identity`. Percent identity.\r\n  - `--extract_contigs_blast_max_target_seqs`. Maximum number of aligned sequences to keep (value of 5 or more is recommended). Default is 500.\r\n\r\n- The final step of the `hybpiper assemble` pipeline has been renamed from `exonerate_contigs` to `extract_contigs` (as either Exonerate or BLASTn can now be used).\r\n- Reorganised grouping of help options when running `hybpiper assemble --help` to improve clarity. \r\n- Changed option `--timeout_assemble` for `hybpiper assemble` to `--timeout_assemble_reads` to match the step name.\r\n- Changed option `--timeout_exonerate_contigs` for `hybpiper assemble` to `--timeout_extract_contigs` to match the step name.\r\n- Changed option `--exonerate_hit_sliding_window_size` for `hybpiper assemble` to `--trim_hit_sliding_window_size`. This option now applies to either Exonerate hits (and is measured in amino-acids) or BLASTn (measured in nucleotides). Defaults are 5 amino-acids (Exonerate; changed from previous default of 3) or 15 nucleotides (BLASTn).\r\n- Changed option `--exonerate_hit_sliding_window_thresh` for `hybpiper assemble` to `--trim_hit_sliding_window_thresh`. This option now applies to either Exonerate hits (and is measured via amino-acid similarity) or BLASTn (measured via nucleotide similarity). Defaults are 75 for amino-acids (Exonerate; changed from previous default of 55) or 65 for nucleotides (BLASTn).\r\n- Fixed a bug in `fix_targetfile.py` - `MAFFT` is now called via `subprocess` rather than `Bio.Align.Applications.MafftCommandline` when checking for best match translations (see [issue#156](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/issues/156)).\r\n- Added a more informative error message if running `hybpiper retrieve_sequences` or `hybpiper paralog_retriever` from HybPiper version >=2.2.0 on sample folders from HybPiper version >2.2.0. This error occurs because the sample folders do not contain a `<prefix>_chimera_check_performed.txt` file (see [issue#155](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/issues/155)).\r\n- When extracting coding sequences from SPAdes contigs using Exonerate, changed the initial Exonerate run to **not** use the option `--refine full` (see Exonerate docs), unless the option `--exonerate_refine_full` is provided to `hybpiper assemble`. Although the Exonerate option `--refine full` **should** improve output alignments, in some cases it can result in spurious alignment regions (e.g. an intron/non-coding region being included as an \"exon\" alignment) that can get incorporated in to the HybPiper output sequence.    \r\n",

        "description": "- Add option `--end_with` to command `hybpiper assemble`. Allows the user to end the assembly pipeline at a chosen step (map_reads, distribute_reads, assemble_reads, exonerate_contigs).\r\n- Add option `--exonerate_skip_hits_with_frameshifts` to command `hybpiper assemble`. If provided, skip Exonerate hits where the SPAdes contig contains frameshifts when considering hits for assembly of an `*.FNA` sequence. Default behaviour in HybPiper v2.2.0 is to include these hits; previous versions allowed them automatically.\r\n- Add option `--exonerate_skip_hits_with_internal_stop_codons` to command `hybpiper assemble`. If provided, skip Exonerate hits where the SPAdes contig contains internal in-frame stop codon(s) when considering hits for assembly of an `*.FNA` sequence. A single terminal stop codon is allowed. Default behaviour in HybPiper v2.2.0 is to include these hits; previous versions allowed them automatically.  \r\n- Add option `--exonerate_skip_hits_with_terminal_stop_codons` to command `hybpiper assemble`. If provided, skip Exonerate hits where the SPAdes sequence contains a single terminal stop codon. Only applies when option `--exonerate_skip_hits_with_internal_stop_codons` is also provided. Only use this flag if your target file exclusively contains protein-coding genes with no stop codons included, and you would like to prevent any in-frame stop codons in the output sequences. Default behaviour in HybPiper v2.2.0 is to include these hits; previous versions allowed them automatically.\r\n- Add option `--chimeric_stitched_contig_check` to command `hybpiper assemble`. If provided, HybPiper will attempt to determine whether a stitched contig is a potential chimera of contigs from multiple paralogs. Default behaviour in HybPiper v2.2.0 is to skip this check; previous versions performed the check automatically. Skipping this check speeds up the final 'exonerate_contigs' step of the pipeline, significantly.\r\n- Add option `--no_pad_stitched_contig_gaps_with_n` to command `hybpiper assemble`. If provided, when constructing stitched contigs, do not pad any gaps between hits (with respect to the \"best\" protein reference) with a number of Ns corresponding to the reference gap multiplied by 3. Default behaviour in HybPiper v2.2.0 is to pad gaps with Ns; previous versions did this automatically.\r\n- Add option `--skip_targetfile_checks` to command `hybpiper assemble`. Skip the target file checks. Can be used if you are confident that your target file has no issues (e.g. if you have previously run `hybpiper check_targetfile`).\r\n- Add option `--no_spades_eta` to command `hybpiper assemble`. When SPAdes is run concurrently using GNU parallel, the \"--eta\" flag can result in many \"sh: /dev/tty: Device not configured\" errors written to stderr. Using this option removes the \"--eta\" flag to GNU parallel, silencing both ETA output and the error message.  \r\n- Fixed a bug in `exonerate_hits.py` that could (rarely) result in a duplicated region in the output `*.FNA` sequence.\r\n- Fixed a bug in `exonerate_hits.py` that occurred when more than two Exonerate hits had identical query ranges and similarity scores; this could result in a sequence not being returned for the given gene.\r\n- Added `tests` folder containing initial unit tests. Some tests require python package [`pyfakefs`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pyfakefs) to run. \r\n- Refactor of the hybpiper package. New module `hybpiper_main.py` with entry point (moved from `assemble.py`), and some `assemble.py` functions moved to `utils.py`. Target file checking functionality has been consolidated.\r\n- HybPiper now logs to `stdout` rather than `stderr`.\r\n- Commands `hybpiper check_targetfile` and `hybpiper assemble` now write a report file when checking the target file (`check_targetfile_report-<target file name>.txt`), rather than logging details to the main sample log. Command `hybpiper check_targefile` writes the report to the current working directory, whereas command `hybpiper assemble` writes it to the sample directory.\r\n- If the option `--cpu` is not specified for `hybpiper assemble`, HybPiper will now use all available CPUs minus one, rather than all available CPUs.\r\n- Command `hybpiper assemble` now checks for output from previous runs for the pipeline steps selected via `--start_from` and `--end_with` (default is to select all steps). If previous output is found, HybPiper will exit with an error unless the option `--force_overwrite` is provided.\r\n- Corrected the reading frame of sequence `Artocarpus-gene660` in the test dataset target file.\r\n- Command `hybpiper assemble` now writes the file `<prefix>_chimera_check_performed.txt` to the sample directory. This is a text file containing 'True' or 'False' depending on whether the option `--skip_chimeric_genes` was provided to command `hybpiper assemble`. Used by `hybpiper retrieve_sequences` and `hybpiper paralog_retriever`.\r\n",

See [wiki](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki#hybpiper-filter_by_length) for more information.\r\n- Update the regex used to check target file fasta header formatting, to capture scenarios where a name contains multiple dashes and also ends with a dash.\r\n- In the `fix_targetfile.py` module, remove the import of `Bio.Align.Applications.MafftCommandline` and call `MAFFT` via `subprocess` (see [issue#147](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/issues/147)).\r\n- In the `gene_recovery_heatmap.py` module, cast the dataframe from the `seq_lengths_file` to object `dtype` to avoid a [deprecation warning](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v2.1.0.html#deprecated-silent-upcasting-in-setitem-like-series-operations) .\r\n- Add option `--no_heatmap` to command `hybpiper paralog_retriever` (see [issue#150](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/discussions/150)).\r\n- Fix an Exonerate-related debug message in `exonerate_hits.py`.",

        "description": "**1.3 The Herbarium Update** *January, 2018*\r\n\r\nBug fixes and features related to the use of targeted sequencing from herbarium material. These samples tend to have short contigs that can cause issues when trying to assemble full-length genes.\r\n\r\n### Features \r\n- Added `--exclude`  flag to be the inverse of `--target`: all sequences with the specified string will not be used as targets for exon extraction (they will still be used for read-mapping). Useful if you want to add supercontig sequence to the target file, but not use it for exon extraction.\r\n\r\n- Added `--addN` to `intronerate.py`. This feature will add 10 N characters in between joined contig when recovering the supercontig. This is useful for identifying where the intron recovery fails, and for annotation processing (i.e. for GenBank).\r\n\r\n- Added a new version of the heatmap script, `gene_recovery_heatmap_ggplot.R`. This script is much simpler and produces nice color PNG images, but struggles a bit on PDF output. The original heatmap script is stil included. *Thanks to Paul Wolf for the ggplot code!*\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- Fixed misassembly of supercontigs when there are multiple alignments to different parts of the same exon.\r\n- Fixed poor filtering of GFF results to produce intron/exon annotation.\r\n- Fixed non-propogation of exonerate parameters\r\n",

        "description": "### Features \r\n\r\n- Added `--unpaired` flag. When using paired-end sequencing reads, a third read file may be specified with this flag. Reads will be mapped to targets separately, but will be used along with paired reads in contig assembly.\r\n\r\n- Added `--target` flag. Adds the ability to choose which of the reference sequences is used for each gene. If `--target` is a file (tab-delimited file with one gene and one target name per line), HybPiper will use that. Otherwise `--target` can be the name of one reference. HybPiper will only use targets with the specified name in the Alignment/Exon Extraction phase. All other targets for that locus will only be used in the Mapping/Read Sorting phase.\r\n\r\n- Added `--timeout` flag, which uses GNU Parallel to kill processes (i.e. Spades or Exonerate) if they take X percent longer than average. Use if there are a lot of stuck jobs (`--timeout 1000`)\r\n- Python 3 compatibility\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- Can accommodate Solexa FASTQ paired headers\r\n- Fixed `spades_runner.py` not recognizing `--cpu` on redos\r\n- Prints more meaningful messages for some common errors\r\n- Can accommodate `prefix` not being in current directory\r\n- Deletes sorted reads on restart to prevent double counting reads.\r\n- `spades_runner.py` will now respect `--kvals`\r\n- Added initial call to log for `reads_first.py`\r\n",

        "description": "Now with using the SPAdes assembler, there is a higher likelihood of assembling long contigs for each gene. If paralogs (or divergent alleles) exist for the gene sequence, SPAdes will generate multiple long-length contigs.\n\nIn this release, the pipeline will generate warnings if there are multiple long-length contigs for each gene in \"paralog_warning.txt\" within each gene file. It will also save a general \"genes_with_paralog_warnings.txt\" file in the main directory with a list of genes to consider further.\n\nOne option for paralogous genes is to extract coding sequences from each paralog and treat them as separate loci, and re-run the pipeline. The reads may then be accurately distributed to each paralog.\n\nWe are also happy to report the name change of the pipeline to HybPiper!

Alternatively, the HybPiper conda package for all versions prior to 2.1.0 includes pre-release Biopython version 1.80.dev0; note that this **causes problems** if the user then installs Biopython 1.79 via conda in the HybPiper conda environment. The HybPiper conda package for version 2.1.0 now uses the conda Biopython 1.80 release package. \n\n***Python and SPAdes***\n\nThe SPAdes assembler prior to version 3.15.4 is incompatible with Python 3.10 and 3.11, see [here](https://github.com/ablab/spades/issues/873). The highest SPAdes version [available](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/spades) as a macOS conda package is 3.15.2. This means that the macOS conda package for HybPiper is restricted to Python version 3.9 at the highest. This restriction will be removed once SPAdes >= 3.15.4 is released as a macOS conda package.  \n\n**Update 29/05/2024:** SPAdes version 3.15.5 is now available on Bioconda. Bioconda installs of HybPiper version >=2.1.7 will now use this SPAdes version or higher and a Python version higher than 3.9.\n\n---"
