First, we calculate the raw template score as the average over the logarithms of all returned PSI-BLAST E-Values plus twice the standard deviation (also derived from the log(E-Value)). The standard deviation is added to correct for cases with relatively low top scores and relatively high averages. This raw template score is normalized into a value from 0 to 1 by mapping it into a percentile bin obtained from running PSI-BLAST in the same fashion on a sample of all Swiss-Prot proteins (e.g. a score obtained by 90% of the samples for all Swiss-Prot is scored 0.1 = 1-0.9). We call this percentile the template quality score.\n\nThe combined leaf score measures the reliability of each predicted leaf. First, we compile the propagated set of all GO terms for all PSI-BLAST hits. Each term can occur in multiple hits and thus be associated with multiple E-Values. The support of a term is defined as the sum over the logarithm of its E-Values divided by the sum of the logarithm over the E-Values of all hits.

For StudentA, we introduced the options to exclude predictions with a score of 0.5 and to choose the number of PSI-BLAST hits to consider (before: 6; now: 1, 5 or 9). For StudentC, we added alternative PSI-BLAST E-Value thresholds (before: 1e-01; now: 1e00, 1e-03 or 1e-06) and percentage pairwise sequence identity as an alternative to the positive identity. We also enabled the optional output of all branches, instead of restricting it to the most probable one. The original implementation of StudentB had a bug: an alternative graph_path table inverted the order of the columns by mistake. The results of this bug were submitted to CAFA. We fixed the bug and allowed for alternatives in the thresholds for E-Values and maximum numbers of PSI-BLAST hits (E-Value before: 1e-02; now: 1e00, 1e-03 or 1e-06; max. number of hits before: 250 [PSI-BLAST default]; now: 5, 50 or 500).\n\nFor all methods, we also add the choice of the number of PSI-BLAST iterations (before: 2 for all methods; now: 1, 2 or 3). Finally, we enabled the filtering out of Swiss-Prot annotations with unclear experimental support (optional restriction to the following experimental GO evidence codes: IDA, IMP, IPI, IGI, IEP, TAS, IC, EXP).\n\nThe re-parameterization created 36, 54, and 72 different parameter combinations for StudentA-C, respectively. We optimized the parameters by picking the combination leading to the highest Fmax (threshold measure; Eq. 1) on a hold-out data set. This data set comprised all Swiss-Prot proteins annotated with experimentally verified GO terms in 2010 (\"Set 2010\"). All proteins annotated before 2010 served as templates (\"Set < 2010\").

Then, we switched the roles of the two sets and repeated the procedure to obtain predictions for each protein in Set 2010. With these predictions, we trained a commonly used meta classifier [13], namely a weighted least-squares linear regression model.

In order to meta-predict a new target protein, we first annotate it with methods StudentA'-C'. Each predicted GO term is then converted into a vector of three elements (one dimension for each method) and put into the formula above.

First, predicted and experimental subgraphs are reduced to their leaf terms (Figure 1: experimental leaves on the left, predicted leaves on the right). Then, we define a threshold T as before, e.g. T = 0.82, and reduce each prediction to the leaves with a reliability \u2265 T. The recall of a single prediction is given by the number of correctly predicted leaves divided by the number of all experimental leaves. Precision is defined analogously. Consequently, we can derive a recall-precision curve in the same way as for the threshold measure. In Figure 1, we obtain the first non-empty prediction as soon as the threshold reaches 0.80 (the highest score of all predicted leaves is 0.8). In this case, recall and precision correspond to 0/3 = 0.0 and 0/1 = 0.0. \nThe leaf threshold measure is orthogonal to the top-20 and threshold measure: in the case of low recall, for example, the former two measures remove specific GO terms from the prediction and retain only the more general terms. Naturally, more general terms have a higher chance to overlap with the experimental propagation than specific terms, resulting in higher precision. However, the leaves of this reduced prediction are not more likely to overlap with the leaves of the experimental annotation. If the full prediction was the best estimate of the experimental leaves, the reduced version could even result in recall = precision = 0.0 by the leaf threshold measure, because the reduction might remove all correctly predicted leaves. Our new measure assesses how well the exact functions of a protein are predicted. Too general or specific predictions are penalized.\nMaximum F1 score\nThe top-20 and threshold measure were the two main metrics in the CAFA meeting. The leaf measure is introduced here for the first time.

If so, their use as the scoring to be optimized may go against the interest of users (Discussion). In contrast, our new leaf threshold measure (Methods) favors predictions with reasonable amounts of terms over those with overly many. It first reduces all predicted GO terms to the leaf terms and then compares those to the leaves of the true annotation. Achieving, e.g., a recall of 1.0 simply by outputting the entire GO is therefore impossible. This reveals just how bloated predictions can be (Figure 5: rightmost panels): For instance, the baseline background \"method\" Priors (i.e., predicting all GO terms for each target and scoring them by frequency) is now numerically reduced to where it belongs, namely to a very bad performance. Priors' (i.e., randomly picking a protein annotation from Swiss-Prot and scoring terms by frequency), on the other hand, shows up competitive for levels of recall < 0.1 in the MFO category. Since also Priors stopped at recall 0.1, there appears to exist a very common low level leaf in GO. In the BPO, a larger and more complex hierarchy, Priors' fails, too. It remains unclear whether the bad performance of other baseline classifiers (BLAST, GOtcha) under the leaf threshold is due to unnecessarily large predictions in order to achieve high recall or to deeper methodological problems. In any case, our results show that even under this most rigorous measure, we can see fine grained separations between methods.\n \n"

All are exclusively derived from GO and the GO annotated proteins from Swiss-Prot and only differ in their release dates. The first three methods used the GO/Swiss-Prot releases from Oct. 2010 (\"Set < 2010_10\") for both development and group-internal evaluations. We updated to the versions from Dec. 2010 (\"Set < 2010_12\") and submitted all 48,298 CAFA targets with each method. For post-CAFA developments, we used the release of Jan. 2010 as the source for template annotations (\"Set < 2010\"). The independent data set needed for post-CAFA parameter optimization then contained all proteins annotated between January and December 2010 (\"Set 2010\"). Analogously to CAFA, we ignored proteins that had any GO annotation before January 2010 and only retained experimental annotations in the remaining proteins. Experimental GO evidence codes were: IDA, IMP, IPI, IGI, IEP, TAS, IC, and EXP (same as in CAFA). \"Set_2010\" contained 1752 targets with BPO and 1351 with MFO annotations.\n\nThe CAFA organizers provided the original CAFA targets (436 with BPO and 366 with MFO annotations). They correspond to the proteins annotated between January and May 2011 (\"Set 2011\"). This set was derived following a similar algorithm as those in \"Set 2010\". The difference was that the CAFA organizers also excluded annotations from the GOA project in proteins annotated before January 2011 (a resource we left untouched). We used the annotations in \"Set < 2010_12\" to predict proteins in \"Set 2011\".\n\n"

Both correspond to two directed acyclic graphs and capture different aspects of protein function. Functional keywords (\"GO terms\") are nodes and their relationships are labeled edges. The ontology is hierarchical: following the edges from a node, each new term corresponds to a more general concept of the original function. All paths converge at the root node, which can simply be interpreted as, e.g., has a molecular function.\n\nThe complete functional annotation of each protein has two subgraphs (MFO and BPO). If a subgraph does not contain all the terms that can be inferred by going from its nodes to the root, we perform a propagation. Given a set of GO terms, this operation refers to its extension with all ancestral terms. Ancestrors can be found by following all outgoing paths from the terms to the root: each visited node is an ancestor. If the GO terms have scores (e.g. to reflect their reliability), the latter are also propagated: each parent term is simply assigned the maximum score of its children. Sometimes, a propagated subgraph needs to be reduced again to the leaf terms. A leaf term is not the parent of any other term in the propagation and corresponds to the most exact description of a function for the given protein.\n\nIn order to integrate the operations above into our methods, we used the graph_path table provided by the GO consortium. It contains all possible paths in the entire GO graph, pre-calculated by specific path inference rules.\n"

Each target corresponds to one or two propagated GO subgraphs of experimentally validated terms (depending on whether both BPO and MFO annotations are available or only one of the two). A method is supposed to predict these subgraphs and assign a reliability between 0.0 and 1.0 to each predicted term. Then we assess their accuracy in the following ways, separately for the MFO and BPO. For the first two measures, we exclusively used the original CAFA implementations, GO version, targets and target annotations. Only to implement our new leaf threshold measure, we slightly adapted the programs.\n"
