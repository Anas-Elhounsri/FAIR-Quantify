The inputs of NanoMod were a group of reads from a DNA sample with modification at specific bases and a group of reads from the matched non-modified sample. The nucleotide sequences for tested samples are assumed to be known, that is, the reference genome must be already known a priori. Currently, within NanoMod, we used albacore for basecalling, and then perform an indel error correction by aligning electric signals to a reference genome, similar to the procedure implemented in nanoraw. After that, two groups of electric signals for each genomic position were tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in a per-base level to identify bases with significantly different distributions of signals between the two groups. Finally, weighted Stouffer\u2019s method was used to combine the effects of neighboring bases since some modifications (especially bulky ones) may have strong neighbor effects that affect electric signals in neighboring non-modified bases.\n \n"
