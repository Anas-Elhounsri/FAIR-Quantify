Where possible, please write a test case\n\nIf you are not able to do that, that's fine! Open an issue anyway and let us\nknow as much information as you can. We will get back to you to determine the\nproblem, and (hopefully) fix it.\n\n### Fix Bugs\n\nCheck out the [open bugs](https://github.com/thomasdenecker/START-R/issues) - anything\ntagged with the **[easy pick]** label could be a good choice for newcomers (and\nwe are willing to help you).\n\nWe have two kind of bugs: **[critical]** and **[bug]**. We tend to fix critical\nbugs as soon as possible. Feel free to come up with a patch before we do though!\n\n### Implement Features\n\nLook through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with\n**[improvement]** or **[feature]** is open to whoever wants to implement it.\n\nIf the issue is unclear or you are not sure what is expected, ask for more\ninformation by commenting on the issue.\n\n### Submit Feedback\n\nAny issue with the **[question]** label is open for feedback, so feel free to\nshare your thoughts with us!\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to [create a new\nissue](https://github.com/thomasdenecker/START-R/issues/new) on GitHub.\n\nIf you are proposing a feature:\n\n* Explain how you envision it working. Try to be as detailed as you can\n* Try to keep the scope as narrow as possible. This will help make it easier to\n  implement\n* Feel free to include any code you might already have, even if it is\n  just a rough idea. This is a volunteer-driven project, and contributions are\n  welcome :)\n\nYour issue will be flagged as **[feature request]** first, and if we agree on\nit, we will label it as **[feature]**, meaning it has been accepted and the\nfeature will eventually be added to the project.\n\n## Pull Request Guidelines\n\nHere are a few rules to follow in order to make code reviews and discussions go\nmore smoothly before maintainers accept and merge your work:\n\n* you MUST test in Docker START-R\n* you MUST comment your code\n* you SHOULD write documentation\n\nPlease, write [commit messages that make\nsense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),\nand [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)\nbefore submitting your Pull Request.\n\nYou may be asked to [squash your\ncommits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)\ntoo. This is to \"clean\" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want\ncommits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).\n\nAlso, while creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description\nwhich gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.\n\nFor further information about creating a Pull Request, please read [this blog\npost](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/11/20/on-creating-pull-requests/).\n\nThank you!\n"

We invite you to verify that the\nfollowing requirements are correctly satisfied before trying to bootstrap the\napplication:\n\n* [Docker 1.12.6+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)\n\n> We recommend you to follow Docker's official documentations to install\nrequired docker tools (see links above).To help you, explanatory videos for each\noperating system are available [here](https://www.bretfisher.com/installdocker/)\n\nTo help you with the installation, you will find below videos on youtube for each system:\n- [Mac OS X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbSsh40_8WM)\n- [Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9AWYlt86B8)\n- [Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Iu5uqby9PY)\n\n**Docker must be on for the duration of START-R use.**\n\n**Important**\n\nNote that the size of the RAM that should be allocated to the Docker depends on\nthe size of the studied organism genome. START-R can work with data from several\norganims. For the human genome, we strongly recommend an increase in allocated memory for Docker.\nOtherwise, the risk is an early termination of the analysis that will be incomplete.\n\nA workstation or a laboratory server with 16GB of RAM is therefore well dimensioned.\nTo increase the allocated memory, go here for\n- [Mac OS X](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#memory)\n- [Windows 10](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced)\n- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#limit-a-containers-access-to-memory)\n"
