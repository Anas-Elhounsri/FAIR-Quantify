See the [ehr_system](https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rEHR/blob/master/R/ehr_system.R) code for details of how the interface with CPRD is implemented. See the [vignette](https://github.com/rOpenHealth/rEHR/blob/master/vignettes/introduction-to-rehr.pdf) for more details. \nThe package was submitted to CRAN but it was removed because it saves temporary files. This is very difficult to overcome in analyses of these databases and a major reconfigurtion would be required for it be resubmitted to CRAN. \nAlso note that the package has various dependencies which tend to break down when the relevant packages are updated in newer versions of R. Although we are trying our best to provide the constant updates needed, the package currently only works with R-3.3.2, as stated in the relevant publication: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171784 \n"
