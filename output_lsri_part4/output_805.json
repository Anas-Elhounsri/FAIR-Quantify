The main design factors taken in consideration were the ease of use,\nhigh portability, and high performance. The library's simulation capabilities\nare only restricted by the amount of available physical memory.

        "value": "# Installation instructions\n\n**Quantum++** is a header-only library that uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as\nits build/install system. **Quantum++** is platform-independent, supporting\n[UNIX](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix) (including\n[macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/)) and UNIX-like operating systems (e.g.,\n[Linux](https://www.linux.org)), as well as\n[Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).\n\n---\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n- C++17 compliant compiler, e.g., [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)\n  , [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org)\n  , [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) etc.\n- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n- [Eigen 3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) linear algebra library. If missing, it\n  will be installed automatically by CMake as a build dependency.\n\n### Optional\n\n- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for building and running the **pyqpp**\n  Python 3 wrapper\n- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) compiler shared\n  libraries and include header files, in case you want to enable\n  interoperability with MATLAB. If enabled, allows applications built with\n  **Quantum++** to save/load **Quantum++** matrices and vectors to/from MATLAB.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the system\n\nFirst configure the system via CMake to use an out-of-source build directory\n(e.g., `./build`) by executing (in a terminal/console/command prompt) under the\nproject's root directory\n\n```shell\ncmake -B build\n```\n\n---\n\n## Building the examples and/or unit tests\n\nTo build the\n[examples](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/examples), execute\n\n```shell\ncmake --build build --target examples --parallel 8\n```\n\nThe above command builds all examples as executables in `./build`. The\n`--parallel 8` flag instructs CMake to build in parallel using 8 threads,\nmodify accordingly.\n\nTo build the\n[unit tests](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/unit_tests), execute\n\n```shell\ncmake --build build/unit_tests --target unit_tests --parallel 8\n```\n\nTu run the unit tests, execute\n\n```shell\nctest --test-dir build\n```\n\nTo build **only** a specific target, execute, e.g.,\n\n```shell\ncmake --build build --target bb84\n```\n\nThe command above builds only the example\n[examples/bb84.cpp](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/examples/bb84.cpp)\nand outputs the executable `./build/bb84[.exe]`.\n\n---\n\n## CMake optional arguments and flags\n\nNote that all CMake flags below that start with `QPP_` and `QASMTOOLS_`\npropagate to subprojects that use **Quantum++** in\ntheir corresponding `CMakeLists.txt` via `findpackage(qpp ...)`.\n\n| Optional argument       | Value                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`  | `/path/to/install`                     | Installs **Quantum++** header files in a non-standard location (e.g., due to lack of admin. rights)                                                                                                                 |\n|                         |                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| `QPP_MATLAB`            | `ON/OFF` [`OFF` by default]            | Enables (if available)/disables interoperability with MATLAB, allowing to detect MATLAB installation automatically.

If you are running FreeBSD, you can install\n**Quantum++** with\n\n```shell\nsudo pkg install quantum++\n```\n\nand uninstall it with\n\n```shell\nsudo pkg remove quantum++\n```\n\n### macOS/Linux\n\nIf you are running macOS or Linux, you can install **Quantum++** via\n[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with\n\n```shell\nbrew install quantum++\n```\n\nand uninstall it with\n\n```shell\nbrew uninstall quantum++\n```\n\n---\n\n## Building and running a standalone application that uses Quantum++\n\nBelow is a minimal `CMakeLists.txt` of a standalone application that uses\n**Quantum++**. For simplicity, we assume that the whole application is located\nin a single file `src/main.cpp`, and the `CMakeLists.txt` is located in the\nproject's root directory.\n\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)\nproject(standalone)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)\n\n# If the Quantum++ installation path was non-standard, i.e., specified by\n#\n# cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installed/qpp\n#\n# then uncomment the following line and replace the installation path with yours\n\n# set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH \"/path/to/installed/qpp\")\n\nfind_package(qpp REQUIRED)\nadd_executable(standalone src/main.cpp)\ntarget_link_libraries(standalone PUBLIC ${QPP_LINK_DEPS} libqpp)\n\n```\n\n**Do not forget to ALWAYS add `${QPP_LINK_DEPS}` (verbatim)\nto `target_link_libraries()`!** (last line of the\n`CMakeLists.txt` file above).\n\nConfigure the application in an out-of-source directory by executing\n\n```shell\ncmake -B build\n```\n\nfollowed by building the application with\n\n```shell\ncmake --build build\n```\n\nThe commands above builds the `standalone` executable inside the `build`\ndirectory.\n\n---\n\n## Building and running a standalone application that uses Quantum++ without a build system\n\n**Quantum++** is a header-only library. Hence, you can technically build an\napplication that uses **Quantum++** without using a building system, by simply\nusing the compiler and specifying the location to all required dependencies,\nlike below (assumes UNIX/UNIX-like, adapt accordingly for Windows)\n\n```shell\ng++ -pedantic -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \\\n    -O3 -DNDEBUG -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG\n    -isystem $HOME/eigen3 -I $HOME/qpp/include -I $HOME/qpp/qasmtools/include \\\n     src/main.cpp -o my_qpp_app\n```\n\nIf you intend to go via this route, we assume that you are familiar with how\ncompilers work, so we won't add any more explanations to what the line above\ndoes.\n\n---\n\n## Additional platform-specific instructions\n\n### macOS/OS X specific instructions\n\n- We highly recommend installing [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)\n  via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), since the native AppleClang does not offer\n  OpenMP support.\n- In case you get any compiler or linker errors when OpenMP is enabled, you\n  need to install the `libomp` package, e.g., execute\n\n```shell\nbrew install libomp\n```\n\n### MATLAB support under Windows\n\nIf building under Windows\nwith [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support, please add\nthe\nlocation of\n`libmx.dll` and `libmat.dll` (the `.dll` **and not** the `.lib` files) to your\n`PATH` environment variable. For example, on our platform they are located\nunder `C:\\Program Files\\MATLAB\\R2021a\\bin\\win64`.\n\n---\n\n## Python 3 wrapper\n\n[**pyqpp**](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/pyqpp) is a Python 3\nwrapper for **Quantum++**. **pyqpp** requires the same dependencies as\n**Quantum++**, and can be installed using `pip`\n\n```shell\npip install git+https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp\n```\n\nFor more details, please see\n[pyqpp/README.md](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/pyqpp/README.md).\n\n---\n\n## Platform-dependent issues\n\n### SunOS/OpenIndiana\n\nThe Python3 wrapper\n[**pyqpp**](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/pyqpp) doesn't\ncompile under SunOS/OpenIndiana due to errors in `<cmath>` such as\n\n```\nno member named 'llround' in the global namespace; did you mean 'lround'?\n```\n"
