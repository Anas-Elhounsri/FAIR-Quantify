For **arbitrary geometry** and properties please follow the instructions below. \n-User can switch between these by setting **NVESSEL** to any of these options (55,37,26)! for arbitrary case the following functions \n should be altered. \n-**INPUT.m** is used to define all the areterial model properties, such as, number of vessels, number of mesh elements, and the vessel \n mechanical properties. All the instructions are written as comments in front of each parameter assigned inside INPUT function. \n-**LaNrCrC.m** is where you define all the properties related to the network, such as, NODE-CONNECT MATRIX (connecting vessels by nodes), \n Vessel Lengths, Vessel Radii, Resistance, Compliances and etc. \n-**FLOWINPUT.m** is where you can define your own flow input or change the currently available inputs (Alastruey and Figuera et al.) \n-**UFUN.m** is to define velocity profile assignment method. Ex. use new velocity profile or assign the fitted values given in FLOWINPUT (options are ready to use) \n-**PTTcalc.m** calculates PTT starting from the desired cardiac cycle. It will calculate PTT considering if the PTT calculation would \n start at any point during the cycle and gives a plot of all PTTs as a function of starting point and a plot of flow waveform at the \n desired cycle.  \n  If user encounters errors running the code, it is due to small total TIME at INPUT and can be fixed by one of the following methods:\n  1) Adjust the number of time-steps in line 45 of **PTTcalc.m** function. Ex. change it from 5000 to smaller value! \n  2) Increase the total calculation TIME at **INPUT.m**\n  3) Turn off PTTcalculation by putting it to 0 at **INPUT.m** \n"
