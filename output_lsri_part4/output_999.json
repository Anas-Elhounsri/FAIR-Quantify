        "value": "ODAE: Ontology of Drug Adverse Events \nThe ODAE is developed as a biomedical ontology in the area of drug adverse events. It is developed by following OBO Foundry principles (e.g., openness, collaboration). \nAs defined by the US FDA, an adverse drug event (ADE), also call adverse drug reaction (ADR) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. ADEs are ranked as the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and Canada behind heart disease, cancer, and stroke. In Europe, approximately 5 % of all hospital admissions are caused by ADEs, and ADEs cause 197,000 deaths annually throughout the EU. ADEs are estimated as the sixth leading cause of death worldwide. ADE-related death rates are associated with age, race, and urbanization subgroups.  \nODAE extends the Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE). OAE also references the [Ontology of Drug Neuropathy Adverse events (ODNAE)](https://github.com/odnae/odnae) and the [Ontology of Cardiovascular Drug AEs (OCVDAE)](https://github.com/OCVDAE/OCVDAE). Different from ODNAE and OCVDAE, ODAE is built on a general ontology design pattern that takes into account the impact of more factors determining ADE including patient age and disease conditions.    \nThe ODAE is primarily developed in the Oliver He laboratory at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. Professor Yu Lin and her colleagues from Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital and Guizhou University Medical College, Guiyang, Guizhou, China, also contributed significantly to the development of ODAE and its use cases. \n  \n"
