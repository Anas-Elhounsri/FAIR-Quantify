To run PopInf, go through all lines in the configuration file and make sure to change the content as specified.\nThe config file is named `popInf.config.json` and is located in this folder. See below for details. We also provide an example our configuration file below:\n\n`popInf.config.json:`\n```\n{\n  \"_comment_sample_info\": \"This section of the .json file asks for sample information\",\n  \"ref_panel_pop_info_path\": \"Sample_Information/ThousandGenomesSamples_AdmxRm.txt\",\n  \"unkn_panel_pop_info_path\": \"Sample_Information/ThousandGenomesSamples_Admx_samples.txt\",\n\n  \"_comment_general_options\": \"This section of the .json file asks for information needed to run popInf regardelss of what chromosomes you choose to analyze\",\n  \"Autosomes_Yes_or_No\": \"Y\",\n  \"ref_path\": \"Reference_Genome/hs37d5.fa\",\n  \"genotype_call_rate_threshold\": \"0.98\",\n\n  \"_comment_autosomes\": \"This section of the .json file asks for information needed for the autosomes if they are to be analyzed\",\n  \"vcf_ref_panel_path\": \"Reference_Panel/\",\n  \"vcf_ref_panel_prefix\": \"chr\",\n  \"vcf_ref_panel_suffix\": \"_1000genomes_selected_individuals_SNPs_nomissing.dupsRemoved.thinned.vcf.gz\",\n  \"vcf_unknown_set_path\": \"Unknown_Samples/\",\n  \"vcf_unknown_set_prefix\": \"chr\",\n  \"vcf_unknown_set_suffix\": \"_1000genomes_admixed_samples.dupsRemoved.thinned.vcf.gz\",\n  \"chromosome\": [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\",\n                 \"8\", \"9\", \"10\", \"11\", \"12\", \"13\", \"14\",\n                 \"15\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", \"19\", \"20\", \"21\", \"22\"],\n\n  \"_comment_chrX\": \"This section of the .json file asks for information needed for the analysis of the X chromosome\",\n  \"vcf_ref_panel_path_X\": \"Reference_Panel/\",\n  \"vcf_ref_panel_file\": \"chrX_1000genomes_selected_individuals.dupsRemoved.thinned.vcf.gz\",\n  \"vcf_unknown_set_path_X\": \"/scratch/amtarave/test_set_POPINF/1000genomes/\",\n  \"vcf_unknown_set_file\": \"chrX_1000genomes_admixed_samples.dupsRemoved.thinned.vcf.gz\",\n  \"X_chr_coordinates\": \"X_chromosome_regions_XTR_hg19.bed\"\n}\n```\nAfter editing `popInf.config.json` make sure that this file has maintained proper json format. You can use The JSON Validator for example (https://jsonlint.com/).\n\nIf you are running PopInf with the test data in this repository, you should not have to change anything in `PopInf.config.json`. However, we suggests double checking prior to running PopInf.\n\nBelow, are the details on what to add or change in the `PopInf.config.json`.\n"
