        "value": "rHAT is a seed-and-extension-based noisy long read alignment tool. It is suitable for aligning 3rd generation sequencing reads which are in large read length with relatively high error rate, especially Pacbio's Single Molecule Read-time (SMRT) sequencing reads. \n\nrHAT indexes the genome with a hash table-based index (regional hash table, RHT) which describes the short tokens occurring in local windows of reference genome. With this index, rHAT adopts a specifically designed seed-and-extension strategy. In the seeding phase, the occurrences of short token matches between partial read and local genomic windows are efficiently calculated to find highly possible sites as candidates for extension. In the extension phase, a sparse dynamic programming-based heuristic approach is adopted for reducing the cost of the alignment between the long noisy read and the local reference sequence. \n\nrHAT has outstanding throughput on aligning SMRT reads from various prokaryote and eukaryote genomes. Benchmarking on a series of model organism genomes, e.g., E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, H. sapiens, etc., demonstrated that it can be two to several times as fast as currently state-of-the-art aligners. Meanwhile, rHAT can sensitively and consecutively aligns the read, i.e., most of the noisy long reads can be end-to-end aligned, and all the bases can be covered.\nrHAT is open source and free for non-commercial use.\n\nrHAT is mainly designed by Bo Liu and developed by Dengfeng Guan in Center for Bioinformatics, Harbin Institute of Technology, China.\n\n---\n"
