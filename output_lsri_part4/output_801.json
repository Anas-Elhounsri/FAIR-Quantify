Operations underpinning realtime SNN execution are presented, including an event-based operating system facilitating efficient time-driven neuron state updates and pipelined event-driven spike processing. Preprocessing, realtime execution, and neuron/synapse model implementations are discussed, all in the context of a simple example SNN. Simulation results are demonstrated, together with performance profiling providing insights into how software interacts with the underlying hardware to achieve realtime execution. System performance is shown to be within a factor of 2 of the original design target of 10,000 synaptic events per millisecond, however SNN topology is shown to influence performance considerably. A cost model is therefore developed characterizing the effect of network connectivity and SNN partitioning. This model enables users to estimate SNN simulation performance, allows the SpiNNaker team to make predictions on the impact of performance improvements, and helps demonstrate the continued potential of the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware.\n  authors:\n  - given-names: Oliver\n    family-names: Rhodes\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1728-2828\n    website: https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/oliver.rhodes\n  - given-names: Petrut\n    family-names: Bogdan\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5535-7865\n  - given-names: Christian Y.\n    family-names: Brenninkmeijer\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    email: christian.brenninkmeijer@manchester.ac.uk\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2937-7819\n    website: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christian_Brenninkmeijer\n  - given-names: Simon\n    family-names: Davidson\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5385-442X\n    website: https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/simon.davidson\n  - given-names: Donal\n    family-names: Fellows\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9091-5938\n    website: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donal-Fellows\n  - given-names: Andrew\n    family-names: Gait\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9349-1096\n    website: https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/andrew.gait/\n  - given-names: David R.\n    family-names: Lester\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7267-291X\n  - given-names: Mantas\n    family-names: Mikaitis\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8706-1436\n    website: https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/mantas.mikaitis\n  - given-names: Luis A.\n    family-names: Plana\n    affiliation: University Of Manchester\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6113-3929\n    website: https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/luis.plana\n  - given-names: Andrew G.

        "description": "Get this release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sPyNNaker/).\r\n\r\n    pip install sPyNNaker \"1!7.0.0\"\r\n\r\n## Main Changes\r\n1. The **range of supported Python versions** has changed; we now support (and test with) Python **3.8 \u2013 3.11**.\r\n2. We have changed the software license from GPL v3 to **Apache v2**.\r\n3. **sPyNNaker8 is _strongly_ deprecated;** it was a transitional Python package while we migrated to PyNN 0.8, and now we only support later versions of PyNN. Use the code in the `spynnaker.pyNN` package instead.\r\n4. We now provide support for **neuromodulatory inputs** (dopamine) in some models. Because of the numerical complexity involved, please contact us if you want to use this with any other neuromodulation inputs.\r\n5. We now support some **convolution connectors** to some neuron models in order to efficiently support input from digital retinas.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Making the configs truly global  by
