        "value": "Please refer to the following publication for a detailed description of the software:  \nBioinformatics, btx709, [https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx709](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx709)\n  \n<br />  \n\n\n_What is *Orchid*?_ \n\nThe objective of **Orchid** is to facilitate meaningful biological and clinical interpretation of tumor genetic data through the use of machine learning. For example, **Orchid** could be used to classify aggressive vs. non-aggressive prostate cancer or determine the tissue-of-origin from the cell-free DNA molecules of a patient with cancer.\n  \n<br />  \n\n_What is a 'tumor mutational profile'?_\n\nIn the **Orchid** framework, we define a _tumor mutational profile_ as the annotated set of mutations within a tumor. A typical tumor might contain thousands of mutations. Most are presumed to be irrelevant to disease because they arise due to an important hallmark of cancer- an unstable genome. However, a crucial subset of these mutations is considered fundamental to carcinogenesis, or at least significantly involved, making them potential biomarkers for clinical classification (e.g. tumor aggressiveness). **Orchid** adopts a comprehensive approach to variant analysis, employing machine learning algorithms to collectively analyze all mutations. This methodology exposes nuanced mutational patterns and helps tease apart biological complexity.\n\n<br />  \n\n\n_What is an 'annotated set of mutations'?_\n  \nAnnotations are numeric or categorical values that are associated with a particular mutation. For example, mutation 'A' may change the amino acid sequence of a protein, so we can annotate it with one category of amino acid consequences: a 'non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism' or 'nsSNP'. On the other hand, mutation 'B' may change a codon, but not the corresponding amino acid, so we would annotate it with another amino acid consequence category: a 'synonymous SNP'. Biologically speaking, nsSNPs are more likely to change the effect of a protein than a synonymous one. In the machine learning world, annotations like these are called _features_. If we gather many mutations across a tumor (or tumors) and annotate each mutation with many features, we end up with a set of annotated mutations, which we call a _tumor mutational profile_.\n\nTo date, many regulatory and coding features of the human genome have been cataloged. If we gather enough biological data to annotate mutations found in a tumor genome, we may be able to understand the mutational process in cancer. For development and publication of this software, we used quite a few public biological databases ([see here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190109010853/http://wittelab.ucsf.edu/orchid); **Note:** This page is now archived). In practice, any can be used.\n\nHere's an example of a mutational profile: \n![Mutational Profile](images/mutational_profiles.png)\n    \nMutations are arranged in rows and corresponding feature values in columns. The values here are normalized and colored white to orange (low to high). There is also a final column of sample labels, which is ultimately used for training and validation. **NOTE:** You may notice a lot of correlated feature vectors. Before training a ML model, its important to reduce feature correlation as much as possible! \n\n"
