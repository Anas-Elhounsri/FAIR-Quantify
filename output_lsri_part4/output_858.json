        "value": "In this study, by applying the state-of-art machine learning techniques, we have developed the first deep learning model, DeepCirCode, to predict back-splicing for human circular RNA (circRNA) formation. DeepCirCode utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) with nucleotide sequence as the input. Each kernel in the first CNN layer of DeepCirCode can be regarded as a motif scanner. Relevant features for circRNA formation can be automatically learnt by DeepCirCode. In order to make DeepCirCode-learnt features biologically interpretable, we have implemented a visualization method to represent these features as sequence motifs, some of which match human known motifs involved in RNA splicing, transcription or translation. DeepCirCode has been applied to three species for circRNA back-splicing prediction, including human, mouse and fruit fly. Comparision of DeepCirCode-learnt motifs from these species has also been performed.   \nThis documentation is part of the supplementary information release for DeepCirCode. For details of this work, users can refer to our paper \"**Deep Learning of the Back-splicing Code for Circular RNA Formation**\" (J. Wang  and L. Wang, 2019). \n \n"
