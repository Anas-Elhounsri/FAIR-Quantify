The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you want to submit a pull request, open an issue, or ask for a feature.\n\n#### Table of Contents\n\n- [TLDR;](#tldr)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n  - [Bug Reports](#bugs)\n  - [Feature Requests](#features)\n  - [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)\n\n<a name=\"tldr\"></a>\n## TLDR;\n- [Development setup guide](./SETUP.md)\n- Creating an Issue or Pull Request requires a [GitHub](http://github.com) account.\n- Issue reports should be **clear**, **concise** and **reproducible**. Check to see if your issue has already been resolved in the [master]() branch or already reported in Coinstac's [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/trendcenter/coinstac/issues).\n- App issues should use the bug issue template with corresponding information\n- All other codebase issues should be prefaced with the [Package Name] (eg: coinstac-pipeline: issue title)\n- Question or clarification issues are acceptable, use the `question` tag\n- Pull Requests must adhere to the package eslint rules.\n- **IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.\n\n\n\n<a name=\"contributing\"></a>\n## Contributing\n\nThe issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),\n[feature requests](#features) and [submitting pull\nrequests](#pull-requests).\n\n<a name=\"bugs\"></a>\n### Bug Reports\n\nGuidelines for bug reports:\n\n1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.\n2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest build of coinstac\n3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a test case to demonstrate your issue. Screenshots, and video are best for in App problems, the App issue submit will also grab the necessary logs.\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? For simulator, what Node.js versions experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.\n\nSpecific computation issues and features should be posted to the computation repository, the Coinstac team's computations can be found [here](https://github.com/trendscenter).\n\n<a name=\"features\"></a>\n### Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests are welcome. Please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project and provide as much detail and context as possible. Specific computation issues and features should be posted to the computation repository, the Coinstac team's computations can be found [here](https://github.com/trendscenter).\n\n<a name=\"pull-requests\"></a>\n### Pull Requests\n\n- PRs for bug fixes are always welcome.\n- PRs for security fixes are always welcome.\n- PRs that increase test coverage are always welcome.\n- PRs are scrutinized for coding-style.\n\nGood pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.\n\n**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.\n\n**At a mininum** pull requests should adhere to the lint standards in the projects eslint config, add any relevant unit testing, and pass end to end testing in the UI package.\n\nPlease adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.)\n\nFollow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the project:\n\n1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:\n\n```bash\n# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\ngit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>\n# Navigate to the newly cloned directory\ncd <repo-name>\n# Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>\n```\n\n2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master\ngit pull upstream master\n```\n\n3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project master branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\n4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. You can use Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.\n\n5. Run you code to make sure it works. Please follow the [setup guide](./SETUP.md) to get your coinstac environment setup to run.\n\n```bash\n# Unit test in the specific package\nnpm test\n# e2e in the ui repo\nnpm run test:e2e\n```\n\n6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:\n\n```bash\ngit pull [--rebase] upstream master\n```\n\n7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\n8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description, following the PR template in the repo\n\n**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.\n\n<a name=\"resources\"></a>\n### Resources\n\n- [Development setup guide](./SETUP.md)\n- [Algorithm development guide](./algorithm-development/coinstac-development-guide.md)\n"

Federated (decentralized) pipelines allow for distributed, iterative, and feature rich analyses to be run, opening new and exciting capabilities for collaborative computation.

Our strategy enables otherwise \"locked-down data\" to become useful again.\n\nCOINSTAC removes the barriers to collaborative analysis by:\n\n- **decentralizing analyses and computation**\n  - each user performs analyses/pipelines/etc all on their own computers. Bits and pieces of each users' output _may_ be sent to a central compute node\n  - a central compute node performs a complimentary component of the group analysis, generally a Machine Learning algorithm. This node may trigger adjusted computations on users' machines, generally in effort to improve a model, which the research is trying to predict!\n- _not_ synchronizing full datasets. instead, **synchronizing only resultant analysis metrics**\n  - as previously discussed, central compute nodes aggregate these metrics, and attempt to draw conclusions from the contributor swarm\n  - because machine learning algorithms can be designed to model outcomes via artifacts of your analysis Pipelines, we keep your data safely and conveniently on your own machine, _untouched_.\n- **applying differential privacy** strategies to truly anonymize private data, whilst still permitting collaboration.\n\nYou may wonder why we haven't been doing this before! Us too. Let's get started!\n"

Who is going to actually \"run\" all of the data?\n\n- Ensuring privacy can be difficult. Can I trust other people or institutions with my research participants' data? Am I even allowed to share it?\n\n- Large datasets can be expensive to transfer. When file sets are in the GB and TB range, network transfers are not immediately trivial or even practical.\n\n- Valuable research data may often not be shared due to privacy or IRB constraints.\n\n- \"Smart bullies\" have demonstrated ability to extract personal information from various aggregated, anonymized datasets. How can we share data without revealing confidential information?\n\nBottom line--collaborative group research requires a great deal of coordination. Human and business factors can hamper research from happening at a pace that we are able to handle! Constraints may even forbid group research to occur at all.\n"

There is no cpu minimum but it is recommended to give as many cores as possible to speed up computation processing time.\n\nThese settings can be adjusted in docker preferences\n![docker resources](/img/docker-resources.png)\n\n## Sharing Drives in Docker\n\nIn order for Coinstac to use your data, some folders must be shared. At a minimum the current user's home directory needs to be shared, and whatever folder the data you'd like to process is in.\n\n![docker sharing](/img/docker-sharing.png)\n"
