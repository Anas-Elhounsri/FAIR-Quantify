        "value": "scNPF is an R package for pre-processing of single-cell RNA-seq data by leveraging the context-specific topology inherent in the given data and the network information from priori gene-gene interaction networks. The basic scNPF framework consists of two modules (Figure 1), including scNPF-propagation for imputing dropouts and scNPF-fusion for fusing multiple smoothed expression matrices to learn a cell-cell similarity matrix. The scNPF framework is highly integrative and flexible in that the two modules are independent but interconnected. scNPF-propagation involves a network propagation process based on random walk with restart (RWR) on a given gene-gene interaction network to obtain a distribution for each node (gene), which captures its relevance to all other genes in the network. This process takes the global connectivity patterns of the interaction network into account for profiling the topological context of each gene. More importantly, this module contains two modes of propagation, including the priori mode that uses a publicly available interaction network and the context mode that is solely based on the given scRNA-seq data set. The output of scNPF-propagation is a propagated gene-cell expression matrix, which could be used as input for scNPF-fusion. scNPF-fusion constructs a sample-similarity network for each propagated expression matrix and then integrates different networks into a single cell-cell similarity network based on a nonlinear combination method. The learned similarity matrix from scNPF-fusion or the smoothed expression matrix from scNPF-propagation can be used as inputs for other existing scRNA-seq pipelines or tools for downstream analyses, such as cell type clustering, dimension reduction, and visualization. \n![image](https://github.com/BMILAB/scNPF/blob/master/images/Schematic%20diagram%20of%20the%20scNPF%20framework.png)\n                       Figure 1.
