The non-Jax version is smaller on disk due to smaller\ndependencies, but may not run as fast.\n\n\nThe development version can be installed directly from github via `pip`:\n\n```bash\n# Get the compressed tarball\npip install https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar/archive/master.tar.gz\n# Or obtain a temporary clone of the repo with git\npip install git+https://github.com/choderalab/pymbar.git\n```\n"
