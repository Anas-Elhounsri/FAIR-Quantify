On most computers you should be able to start the app with \na double click. (Note to M1/M2 MacIntosh users - we have noted that problems occur with JavaFX applications such as GOPHER\non M1 Macs with Java 17; we recommend using the Java 19 JDK from [Azul](https://www.azul.com/) Zulu). If desired, you can\nalso start Gopher from the command line as follows.\n```shell\njava -jar GOPHER-0.9.0.jar\n```\nWe recommend starting GOPHER with 2Gb (min)/6Gb (max) memory.\n```shell\njava -Xms2g -Xmx6g -jar GOPHER-0.9.0.jar\n```\n \nGOPHER will run without problems on 2GB for small panels (-Xmx2g), but 6GB is preferable for probe design\nfor all protein-coding genes or other very larger panels. \n"
