This includes similarity ratings, similarity rankings, pile-sorts, and categorization of stimuli. Not all of this functionality is implemented. Contributions that support this functionality are welcome.\n\nPsiZ closely adheres to TensorFlow and Keras idioms. Model components are implemented as layers. Custom Keras objects are placed in `psiz.keras` and intentionally mirror the module structure of `keras` in order to leverage developers and users pre-existing knowledge of Keras' organization.\n\n## Issues\n\n* Please tag your issue with `bug`, `enhancement`, or `question` to help us effectively respond.\n* Please include the versions of TensorFlow, TensorFlow Probability and PsiZ you are running.\n* Please provide the command line or code you ran as well as the log output.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nPlease send in fixes and feature additions through Pull Requests.\n\n## Testing\n\n* PsiZ uses a number of tools for testing.\n    * `pytest` for testing\n    * `pytest-cov` for coverage analytics\n    * `tox` for locally testing multiple python versions (`tox` is not used for remote GitHub Actions testing).\n* These packages should be installed separately by the tester, but most of these packages can be installed at the same time as the core dependencies of psiz using the option `pip install \"psiz[test]\"`.\n* See `pytest.ini` for a list and description of all pytest markers (e.g., `slow`).\n    * NOTE: All pytest markers must be registered in `pytest.ini`, unregistered markers will generate an error.\n\n### Useful Commands for Local Checks\n* `pytest -m \"not slow\"`\n    * Only run tests that are not marked as `slow`.\n* `pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=psiz tests`\n    * Output a coverage report to the terminal that includes which statements were not covered by the tests.\n\n### Linting\n* Useful commands:\n    * `flake8 src --ignore=F401,E501,W503 --count --show-source --statistics`\n    * `pylint --disable=R,C,W --ignored-modules=tensorflow src`\n\n## Versioning\n* Versions are released following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) which follows the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.\n\n---\n**WARNING:** This package is pre-release and the API is not stable. Minor version changes may contain breaking changes until `v1.0.0` is released.\n\n---\n\n### Branches\n* `main`: Always points to the latest stable version.\n* `r<MAJOR>.<MINOR>`: The major-minor branches serve as a development branches. Note that a new branch is **NOT** created for each patch version.\n    * Developers should create feature branches that branch from a particular \"major-minor branch\" `rX.Y`. \n\n### Tags and Releases\n* All releases are tagged using the format `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>`, thus a given release branch can have multiple tags that differ by patch number.\n* Only tagged releases on a major-minor branch are merged with `main`.\n\n## Docs\n\n* To test generating the docs, you will need to make sure you have the appropriate dependencies installed: `python -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir -r docs/requirements.txt`.\n* You can then build the docs by executing the following command inside the `docs` directory: `make html`.\n* The built html files can be found in `docs/_build/html`"

Please see the [TF compatibility matrix](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu) for supported Python and CUDA versions for each version of TensorFlow. As of PsiZ v0.12, Keras 3 is used for the majority of layers, which allows users to use either TensorFlow or Pytorch. Your preferred backend can be set by modifying the configuration file automatically created by Keras: `~/.keras/keras.json`. Pytorch support is still experimental.\n* PsiZ versions <=0.5.0 must be installed using git clone and editable mode (e.g., `pip install -e /local/path/to/psiz`).\n* You can install specific releases:\n    * using PyPI: `pip install 'psiz==0.5.1'`\n    * using git: `git clone https://github.com/psiz-org/psiz.git --branch v0.5.1`\n"

Migrating these objects to backend agnostic versions is still a work in progress.\r\n* Update gate objects.\r\n    * Streamline `Gate` abstract class.\r\n    * Require using mixing weights. If you were previously using indices, you must convert your indices to one-hot float weights ahead of time.\r\n    * Remove redundant `BranchGate` layer. This layer does not have a clear use case given that it is easy to specify a functional or subclassed model with multiple branches.\r\n* Remove deprecated classes and associated tests:\r\n    * `RankSimilarity`: Use `SoftRank` layer instead.\r\n    * `RateSimilarity`: Use `Logistic` layer instead.\r\n    * `ProgressBarRe`: users should use a package like `tqdm` instead (#24 )\r\n    * `DistanceBased`: Use a concrete class of the `Proximity` layer instead.\r\n    * Remove (temporarily) RNN based functionality since the Keras 3 API changed the assumptions associated with RNN inputs, which requires a deep refactor of the existing PsiZ RNN cell objects.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/psiz-org/psiz/compare/v0.12.1...v0.12.2",

In practice, this change means that users have increased responsibility for wiring up the layers, but model readability is now better. Examples, tutorials, and tests have all been updated to reflect these changes. To update code please see the examples.\r\n* Cell-based layers have been moved to `experimental` until a stable API can be determined.\r\n\r\n## Minor Changes\r\n* New `SoftRank` layer includes optional temperature parameter for controlling determinism.

        "description": "# Release 0.8.0\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThis release refocuses the package on essential modeling components. Some modules and functionality has been deprecated or reworked since that functionality is better provided by a third-party. This policy shift will smoothen the road to a stable 1.0 release.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes \r\n* Sub-classed models\r\n    * Designing and maintaining specific models for a given behavior is brittle and has high maintenance costs (e.g., Issue #14).\r\n    * Moving forward, specific behaviors are implemented as Keras `Layer`.\r\n    * The existing `Rank` and `Rate` models are now deprecated, but their functionality is easily reproduced using Keras subclassed `Model` or Functional API. Check out the updated tutorial and examples to see how.\r\n    * Variational inference should be implemented using an abstract class `psiz.keras.models.StochasticModel`. It closely follows TF `Model`, but adds repeated sampling of the batch axis.\r\n* Layers\r\n    * The `RankBehavior` and `RateBehavior` similarity layers have been deprecated and will be removed in the next minor version. Use `RankSimilarity` and `RateSimilarity` layers instead.\r\n* Data management strategy\r\n    * Deprecated `psiz.trials` module, use `psiz.data` module instead.\r\n        * The `psiz.trials` module was unintuitive and was expensive to maintain.\r\n        * Much of the functionality provided by the `psiz.trials` module has been redistributed to existing functionality outside of `psiz`, such as the versatile `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline.\r\n        * Hosting of previously collected datasets will now be handled by a new python package `psiz-datasets`.\r\n* Model restarter logic\r\n    * Custom restarter logic has been removed since the functionality can mostly be achieved by other packages such as Keras Tuner. The subclassed callbacks originally added as a hack have been removed since they are no longer necessary (Issue #27 ).\r\n    * Removed `psiz.keras.Restarter` class\r\n    * Removed `psiz.utils.FitTracker` class\r\n    * Removed `psiz.keras.callbacks.EarlyStoppingRe` class\r\n    * Removed `psiz.keras.callbacks.TensorBoardRe` class\r\n* Gating layers\r\n    * Subnet gating has been replaced with a new set of classes to enable enhanced features.\r\n    * Combined `psiz.keras.layers.Gate` and `psiz.keras.layers.GateMulti` functionality into a new class `psiz.keras.layers.BraidGate` to denote networks that separate and later rejoin. This new class can handle inputs that are a single tensor or a list. The internals of the new class have been re-worked to be cleaner, easier to understand, and more powerful.\r\n    * Added `psiz.keras.layers.BranchGate` to allow branching networks (networks that separate and do not rejoin).\r\n    * Repurposed `Gate` as a new class of the same name that represents an abstract class that performs gating. Both `BranchGate` and `BraidGate` inherit from `Gate`.\r\n    * Added a `GateAdapter` class  which allows dependency injection for formatting a dictionary of Tensor inputs as a list of Tensors.\r\n* Simulating behavior\r\n    *  Deprecated `psiz.agents` module. Agent simulation functionality can easily be achieved with custom code. For an example, see `psiz/examples/rank/mle_1g.py`.\r\n* Utility functions\r\n    * The `pairwise_similarity` function has been deprecated since users should create their own model.   \r\n* Nomenclature\r\n    * Embedding layers  that receive stimulus indices are now referred to as `percept` rather than `stimuli`. This better reflects cognitive modeling semantics.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Bumped TensorFlow version requirement to >=2.10 < 2.11 (and TensorFlow Probability to 0.18.0).\r\n    * Necessary because `Model` `get_config` has since been updated to address some issues that impact common PsiZ use cases.\r\n* Refactored examples to reflect updated PsiZ best practice.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n* Added foundational support for sequence modeling.\r\n* Added a new `psiz.data` module that provides lightweight classes that serve as an intuitive on-ramp for marshaling data into a model-consumable format.",

        "description": "# Release 0.8.0\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThis release refocuses the package on essential modeling components. Some modules and functionality has been deprecated or reworked since that functionality is better provided by a third-party. This policy shift will smoothen the road to a stable 1.0 release.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes \r\n* Sub-classed models\r\n    * Designing and maintaining specific models for a given behavior is brittle and has high maintenance costs (e.g., Issue #14).\r\n    * Moving forward, specific behaviors are implemented as Keras `Layer`.\r\n    * The existing `Rank` and `Rate` models are now deprecated, but their functionality is easily reproduced using Keras subclassed `Model` or Functional API. Check out the updated tutorial and examples to see how.\r\n    * Variational inference should be implemented using an abstract class `psiz.keras.models.StochasticModel`. It closely follows TF `Model`, but adds repeated sampling of the batch axis.\r\n* Layers\r\n    * The `RankBehavior` and `RateBehavior` similarity layers have been deprecated and will be removed in the next minor version. Use `RankSimilarity` and `RateSimilarity` layers instead.\r\n* Data management strategy\r\n    * Deprecated `psiz.trials` module, use `psiz.data` module instead.\r\n        * The `psiz.trials` module was unintuitive and was expensive to maintain.\r\n        * Much of the functionality provided by the `psiz.trials` module has been redistributed to existing functionality outside of `psiz`, such as the versatile `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline.\r\n        * Hosting of previously collected datasets will now be handled by a new python package `psiz-datasets`.\r\n* Model restarter logic\r\n    * Custom restarter logic has been removed since the functionality can mostly be achieved by other packages such as Keras Tuner. The subclassed callbacks originally added as a hack have been removed since they are no longer necessary (Issue #27 ).\r\n    * Removed `psiz.keras.Restarter` class\r\n    * Removed `psiz.utils.FitTracker` class\r\n    * Removed `psiz.keras.callbacks.EarlyStoppingRe` class\r\n    * Removed `psiz.keras.callbacks.TensorBoardRe` class\r\n* Gating layers\r\n    * Subnet gating has been replaced with a new set of classes to enable enhanced features.\r\n    * Combined `psiz.keras.layers.Gate` and `psiz.keras.layers.GateMulti` functionality into a new class `psiz.keras.layers.BraidGate` to denote networks that separate and later rejoin. This new class can handle inputs that are a single tensor or a list. The internals of the new class have been re-worked to be cleaner, easier to understand, and more powerful.\r\n    * Added `psiz.keras.layers.BranchGate` to allow branching networks (networks that separate and do not rejoin).\r\n    * Repurposed `Gate` as a new class of the same name that represents an abstract class that performs gating. Both `BranchGate` and `BraidGate` inherit from `Gate`.\r\n    * Added a `GateAdapter` class  which allows dependency injection for formatting a dictionary of Tensor inputs as a list of Tensors.\r\n* Simulating behavior\r\n    *  Deprecated `psiz.agents` module. Agent simulation functionality can easily be achieved with custom code. For an example, see `psiz/examples/rank/mle_1g.py`.\r\n* Utility functions\r\n    * The `pairwise_similarity` function has been deprecated since users should create their own model.   \r\n* Nomenclature\r\n    * Embedding layers  that receive stimulus indices are now referred to as `percept` rather than `stimuli`. This better reflects cognitive modeling semantics.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* Bumped TensorFlow version requirement to >=2.10 < 2.11 (and TensorFlow Probability to 0.18.0).\r\n    * Necessary because `Model` `get_config` has since been updated to address some issues that impact common PsiZ use cases.\r\n* Refactored examples to reflect updated PsiZ best practice.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n* Added foundational support for sequence modeling.\r\n* Added a new `psiz.data` module that provides lightweight classes that serve as an intuitive on-ramp for marshaling data into a model-consumable format.",

This class may be added back in the future.\r\n* Removed `matrix_comparison` and `pairwise_matrix` since these utility functions are incompatible with the more general purpose batch-processing pipeline.\r\n* Stimuli indices are now consistent between PsiZ trial objects and TF dataset versions, calling `as_dataset` no longer increments stimuli indices by one. A `mask_zero` argument has been added to the similarity observations classes. See the docs for a discussion of this masking strategy.\r\n* Move `wpnorm` from `keras.layers.ops` to `psiz.tf.ops`\r\n* Remove `NegLogLikelihood` loss and metric\r\n* Removed alias `psiz.models`, users must use `psiz.keras.models`.\r\n* Change `psiz.datasets.load` to `psiz.datasets.load_dataset`\r\n* Organization of information gain computations has been updated.\r\n    * A new submodule has been created: `psiz.trials.information_gain`\r\n    * The function `expected_information_gain_rank` has been renamed `ig_categorical` and moved to `psiz.trials.information_gain`.\r\n    * The input shape of information gain function has changed from `(n_sample, n_trial, n_outcome)` to `(n_trial, n_sample, n_outcome)`. This change makes the dimension semantics consistent with the output of psiz.keras.models (i.e., `(batch_size, n_sample, n_outcome)`).\r\n* Rename `RandomAttention` initializer to `Dirichlet`.\r\n* For trials.experimental, change `as_dataset` to `export`.\r\n* Update plotter signature in mplot module. Update removes `fig` as an argument and makes `ax` an optional argument.\r\n* remove `verbose` from load_trials\r\n\r\n## Major Features and Improvements\r\n* Reorganized documentation\r\n* Added Beginner Tutorial\r\n* Add `random_combinations` which handles sampling k-combinations with and without replacement and leans on already existing `choice_wo_replace`.\r\n* Add `ig_model_categorical`, which takes one or more models as an input and computes ensemble-based information gain. Assumes that models generate samples from the posterior on the forward pass (e.g, a variational inference model) and output units are categorical.\r\n* Enhanced `RandomRank` generator:\r\n    * Added weighting functionality.\r\n    * Added `per_query` functionality.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\r\n* Multiple changes to docstrings.\r\n* Fix handling of shape argument on call of Dirichlet initializer. Was only using first dimension of shape array.\r\n* Add `docs` section to optional install that includes packages listed in `conf.py` extensions\r\n* Add optional `rng` argument to `choice_wo_replace`.\r\n* Add dynamic version to PsychologicalEmbedding `get_config`\r\n* For trials.experimental make `_save` and `_load` public methods `save` and `load`.\r\n* Add `__all__` definition to `__init__` files satisfying PEP8 and removing linter complaints \"imported but unused\".\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n* Bump tensorflow-probability requirement to 0.13.0.\r\n* Bump minimum TensorFlow version requirement to v2.4.3 for security fixes.\r\n* Bump maximum TensorFlow version to v2.6.x.\r\n* Add h5py >= 3.0 to setup.cfg so that TrialDataset `_load_h5_group` can safely assume h5py `asstr()` method is available\r\n",

        "description": "This release focus on integration with TF 2.4, cleaning up redundancies in the PsiZ API, and laying the ground-work for a stable API.\r\n\r\n### Major Feature Changes\r\n* TF 2.4 improves support for saving custom models.\r\n* The internal sampling mechanics for stochastic models has changed. 1) Sampling is now handled at the input of the model by creating an additional \"sample\" axis. 2) The sampling axis is now located at `axis=1`. This is a departure from the previous implementation which followed tensorflow-probability, which prepends sample dimensions. Placing the sampling dimensions at axis=0 created many downstream problems where there are often strict assumptions that the first axis is the \"batch\" axis. Together, these two changes have yielded cleaner code that is easier to reason about. In particular, non-input layers can remain ignorant of the sampling strategy implemented at the input.\r\n* Added sparse dispatching functionality (`GroupGate` and `GroupGateMulti`) to facilitate generic group-specific layers.\r\n* New similarity kernel strategy. New strategy is more general, exhibits looser coupling, and does not rely on Embedding layers. New strategy uses a generic `DistanceBased` container layer along with the reworked `Minkowski` layer. The `Minkowski` layer uses a standard set of trainable weights rather than an Embedding layer. Combined with `GroupGateMulti` users can assemble group-specific layers (see `examples/rank/mle_3g.py`). The classes `Kernel`, `AttentionKernel`, `WeightedMinkowski`, `GroupAttention` and `GroupAttentionVariational` have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead use `DistanceBased`, `Minkowski`, `MinkowksiVariational`, and `GroupGateMulti`.\r\n* Expanded tests. Added `slow` pytest marker for slow running tests.\r\n* Added `trials.experimental` which introduces an alternative set of classes for tracking trial data. The primary differences are the use of compositionality and the coding of trials sequences.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n* Calling `model.save` uses TF save method instead of PsiZ's custom save method. See Issue #17 and #19 for advice on converting old models.\r\n* Removed `Proxy` class from API. All examples have been updated. (See Issue #20)\r\n* Replaced `procrustes_2d` utility function with more general and robust `procrustes_rotation` which uses SVD instead of iteration-based optimization. All examples have been updated.\r\n* Shape assumptions for `wpnorm` have changed to be more inclusive. This is only a breaking change for gradient computations.\r\n\r\n### Other Changes\r\n* Moved `models` module into `keras`. A full import looks something like `psiz.keras.models.Rank`. Users can still import models the old way (e.g., `psiz.models.Rank`) although this may be deprecated in the future. This was primarily done to safeguard against future model additions that do not follow the Keras API. A side-effect is that this organization mimics TF.\r\n* Moved `generators` module into trials. \r\n* Removed `preprocessing` module.\r\n* Replaced `visualization` module with `mplot` module. Some functionality is overlapping.\r\n* Internal changes to source code file naming and directory organization.\r\n\r\n### Resolved Issues\r\n* Issue #19: The problem was due to an if statement in the `Rank` call method. The `Rank` refactor creates tighter guarantees on Tensor shapes, eliminating the need for the if statement.",
