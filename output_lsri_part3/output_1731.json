        "value": "# Contributing\n\nThere are a few ways to contribute:\n\n- [Raise an issue](https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/issues) to identify a bug or suggest a new feature.\n- Fork the repository and make a pull request to suggest changes to the code.\n- If you'd like to contribute a mass database, please do this by [raising an\n  issue](https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/issues).\n\n## Repository Structure\n\nCurrently, the `pgfinder` repository is split into two major parts: in the `lib` folder is the library (and CLI)\ncode that forms the heart of PGFinder. The code in this directory is written purely in Python. The other half of this\nrepository is the `pgfinder-gui` web application \u2014 this code lives in the `web` directory. This webapp is written using\n[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and simply wraps PGFinder into a presentable package and passes user inputs to the `pgfinder` Python package\n(running in the client's browser via WebAssembly / Pyodide).\n\nAs these two halves of the applicaton are written using different languages and frameworks, you'll need different tools\nto contribute to each of them.\n\n## Hacking On The `lib` Directory\n\n### Development Installation\n\nThe current version when installed from GitHub is a combination of the most recent Git tag combined with the hash of the\ncurrent `HEAD` of the branch and how many commits away from the last tag it is.\n\nIf you wish to contribute to the development of PGFinder, you should clone (your fork of) this repository, navigate to the\n`lib` directory, and install `pgfinder` in editable mode (`pip install -e`) with the following commands (which install\nadditional dependencies for tests, documentation and linting).\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/PGFinder.git\ncd pgfinder/lib\n# Install in editable mode\npip install -e .\n# Install extra dependencies\npip install -e \".[dev,docs,tests]\"\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nTo run unit tests suite use [pytest](https://pytest.org)\n\n```bash\n# From the `lib` directory...\npytest\n```\n\n### Linting (Also Used in `web`)\n\nPGFinder uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure code conforms to the [PEP8 Python Style\nGuide](https://pep8.org/) using the [ruff](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ruff+linter&t=opera&ia=images) linter, applies\n[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) formatting, and checks for a number of other common mistakes.\nThese hooks are run on GitHub when Pull Requests are made using [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci), and\nif you have not run them locally, then your pull request may fail the tests it needs to pass.\n\n`pre-commit` will have been installed as part of the extra dependencies above (they are part of `dev`), but you need to\ninstall `pre-commit` and the hooks locally in your virtual environment. This can be done with the following commands.\n\n``` bash\npre-commit install\npre-commit install-hooks\n```\n\nNow when you make a `git commit`, the hooks will run first and report any errors. If the errors can be\ncorrected automatically, they will be, but you will have to then `git stage` the\nmodified files again before completing the commit (this gives you an opportunity to review the changes that have been\nmade, but typically they are ok to accept \u2014 they will be `black` formatting or other trivial code-style changes).\n\n\n### Releasing to PyPI\n\nReleases to the [Python Package Index (PyPI)][pypi] are automated and occur when a new release is made on\nGitHub with a tag that begins with `v#.#.#'`. PGFinder uses [semantic verisoning][semver].\n\n## Hacking On the `smitheens` Package\n\nFor detailed information on the Smithereens component please refer to the Smithereens section.\n\n## Hacking On The `web` Directory\n\n### Development Installation\n\nTo contribute to the PGFinder web interface, we recommend using [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/). After navigating to the\n`web` directory, it's easy to get a development version of the GUI running using the commands defined in `package.json`.\n\n``` bash\n# From the `web` directory...\ncd web/\n# Install all development dependencies\npnpm install\n# Spin up a development version of the GUI\npnpm dev\n```\n\nThe development server is equipped with hot-reloading, so there is no need to restart it as you make changes. After making\na change and saving the file you were working on, the webpage should reload automatically.\n\n### Testing\n\nTo test the GUI's functionality (and that it's correctly interfacing with the `pgfinder` backend), you can run `pnpm test`,\nwhich leverages [Playwright][pw] for end-to-end testing.\n\n``` bash\n# Start browser testing in the background\npnpm test\n# Start an interactive testing session and open the UI\npnpm test -- --ui\n```\n\n### Formatting\n\nTo ensure consistent formating throughout the `web` directory, you can run [Prettier][prettier] using the following command:\n\n``` bash\n# Run Prettier\npnpm format\n```\n\n### Linting\n\nTo check for errors or potential improvements to code style, you can run the following commands:\n\n``` bash\n# Check for hard-errors (svelte-check)\npnpm check\n# Do the same, but automatically recheck when the code is changed\npnpm check:watch\n# Check for potential improvements to code style\npnpm lint\n```\n\nFurther details on developing the WebUI can be found under [Svelte][svelte]\n\n\n\n[card]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_cookbook/Card\n[div]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div\n[json]: https://www.json.org/json-en.html\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/\n[pandas]: https://pandas.pydata.org/\n[pathlib]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html\n[pgfinder]: https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/\n[prettier]: https://prettier.io/\n[pw]: https://playwright.dev/\n[pyodide]: https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org\n[semver]: https://semver.org/\n[svelte]: https://svelte.dev/docs/\n[ts]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/\n[vite]: https://vitejs.dev/\n[wa]: https://webassembly.org/\n"

        "description": "Small but significant changes in this release.\r\n\r\n[myBinder](https://mybinder.org) has recently lost significant resources (see [here](https://blog.jupyter.org/mybinder-org-reducing-capacity-c93ccfc6413f) for further details).\r\n\r\nWe have also found that uploading the `.ftrs` and `maxquant` files can take some time.\r\n\r\nA new approach is therefore being adopted that uses [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/) which runs the notebook entirely in the users browser without the need to first start a server locally. This does have a slight downside in that it requires the installation of `PGFinder` and its dependencies when running the notebook which can take 30 seconds or longer depending on the connection. Users also have to be careful about not using a cached version of the PGFinder package, particularly if they wish to test new development versions.\r\n\r\nThere are expanded instructions on how to use the Notebook which can be viewed at [mesnage-org.github.io/pgfinder-jupyterlite](https://mesnage-org.github.io/pgfinder-jupyterlite/lab?path=pgfinder_interactive.ipynb).\r\n\r\nIf you encounter problems please let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/issues).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* ruamel.yaml > pyYAML no longer depend on `ruamel.yaml` for reading and writing YAML files.\r\n* Notebooks now redirect to [mesnage-org.github.io/pgfinder-jupyterlite](https://mesnage-org.github.io/pgfinder-jupyterlite/lab?path=pgfinder_interactive.ipynb).\r\n* README.md redirects to [mesnage-org.github.io/pgfinder-jupyterlite](https://mesnage-org.github.io/pgfinder-jupyterlite/lab?path=pgfinder_interactive.ipynb).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/compare/v0.0.2...v0.0.3",

This means users may find that at times the Interactive Notebook will not launch as there are no available hosts to run the code. We are looking into alternative stable solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ns-rse made their first contribution in https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/pull/75\r\n* @TheLostLambda made their first contribution in https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/pull/138\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/Mesnage-Org/pgfinder/compare/v0.1.0...v0.0.2\r\n",
