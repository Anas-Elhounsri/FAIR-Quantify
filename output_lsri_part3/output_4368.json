The following dependencies are required to run GraphBin and related support scripts.\n\n* [python-igraph](https://igraph.org/python/) - version 0.7.1\n* [biopython](https://biopython.org/) - version 1.74\n* [cairocffi](https://pypi.org/project/cairocffi/)\n\n## Setting up GraphBin\n\n### Method 1: conda install\n\nYou can install GraphBin using the [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/graphbin) distribution. You can download \n[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) which contains `conda`.\n\nNow let's add the required conda channels so we know the locations where packages are stored.\n\n```\nconda config --add channels defaults\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\n```\n\nOnce you have added the channels, you can install GraphBin directly from the bioconda distribution using the command\n\n```\nconda install -c bioconda graphbin\n```\n\nYou can also create a new conda environment and install GraphBin from bioconda using the following commands.\n\n```\n# create conda environment\nconda create -n graphbin\n\n# activate conda environment\nconda activate graphbin\n\n# install graphbin\nconda install -c bioconda graphbin\n```\n\n\n### Method 2: pip install\n\nYou can install GraphBin using `pip` from the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/graphbin/) distribution.\n\n```\npip install graphbin\n```\n\nAfter setup, check if GraphBin is properly installed by typing `graphbin -h` on the command line. You should see the usage options as shown in section [Using GraphBin](https://github.com/Vini2/GraphBin#using-graphbin)\n\nNow let's prepare our results to run GraphBin.\n"
