        "value": "**Ribosome profiling** provides a detailed global snapshot of protein synthesis in a cell.  At its core, this technique makes use of the observation that a translating ribosome protects around 30 nucleotides of the mRNA from nuclease activity.  High-throughput sequencing of these ribosome protected fragments (called ribosome footprints) offers a precise record of the number and location of the ribosomes at the time at which translation is stopped. Mapping the position of the ribosome protected fragments indicates the translated regions within the transcriptome.  Moreover, ribosomes spend different periods of time at different positions, leading to variation in the footprint density along the mRNA transcript. This provides an estimate of how much protein is being produced from each mRNA. Importantly, ribosome profiling is as precise and detailed as RNA sequencing. Even in a short time, since its introduction in 2009, ribosome profiling has been playing a key role in driving biological discovery. \nWe have developed this bioinformatics toolkit, **riboviz**, for analyzing ribosome profiling datasets. **riboviz** consists of a comprehensive and flexible analysis pipeline. The current version, **riboviz 2**, has been extensively tested on datasets from yeast, various other fungi, mouse, bacteria, and archaea. \nAll the code for processing the raw reads is available in this repository. \nConfiguration files and annotation files for many datasets from many organisms are available at the [riboviz/example-datasets](https://github.com/riboviz/example-datasets) repository.\n \n"

It includes information on how to install all of the dependencies required by **riboviz** along with how to access the **riboviz** source code and finishes with links to our documentation on how to run **riboviz** on an example dataset.\n\n**riboviz** runs under Linux and full instructions are provided for Ubuntu and CentOS (these were tested upon Ubuntu 18.04 Ubuntu 20.04.02.0) and CentOS 7 (2009)). Windows users will either need to use a virtual machine or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (links to instructons on how to set these up are provided below). Mac OS users need check out the web sites for each dependency for information on how to install the dependency under Mac OS.\n\n---\n\n## Operating systems\n\n### Linux users\n\nYou need to have permission to run `sudo` to install many of the dependencies. If you don't have `sudo` access you will have to ask a local system administrator to run these commands for you.\n\n### Windows users\n\nWe suggest that you:\n\n* Either, use a virtual machine running under [VMWare Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-player.html) or [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). We provide quick-start instructions for using VMWare to:\n  - [Deploy a Ubuntu Virtual Machine using VMWare on Windows 10](./deploy-ubuntu-vmware-windows.md).\n  - [Deploy a CentOS Virtual Machine using VMWare on Windows 10](./deploy-centos-vmware-windows.md).\n* Or, use Windows Subsystem for Linux following [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). We have successfully installed and run riboviz under WSL2 using Microsoft Store's [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/ubuntu-1804-lts/9n9tngvndl3q).\n\n### Mac OS users\n\nWe suggest that you check out the web sites for each dependency for information on how to install the dependency under Mac OS.\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies overview\n\nThe following tables summarise the packages required by riboviz. Instructions to install each dependency are given in the following sections.\n\n**Note:** Only minimal installation instructions are given. For full information, see the documentation for each dependency.\n\nThe versions listed are those used by a riboviz developer when preparing the current release. Other versions may also be acceptable, but see the constraints below.\n\n| Command-line tool | Version |\n| ----------------- | ------- |\n| Git | 2.17.1 |\n| cURL | 7.69.1 |\n| bedtools | 2.26.0 |\n| hdf5tools (h5diff) | 1.10.6 |\n| pigz | 2.4 |\n| pandoc | 1.19.2.4 |\n| GraphViz (dot) | 2.40.1 |\n| zip | 3.0 |\n| unzip | 6.00 |\n| R | 3.6.3 |\n| Python | 3.7.6 |\n| Cutadapt | 1.18 |\n| samtools | 1.9 |\n| UMI-tools | 1.0.1 |\n| Java (javac) | 1.8.0_152-release |\n| Java (java) | 1.8.0_152-release |\n| Nextflow | 20.04.1.5335 |\n| Hisat2 | 2.1.0 |\n| Bowtie | 1.2.2 |\n\n| R Package | Version |\n| --------- | ------- |\n| Biostrings | 2.54.0 |\n| devtools | 2.3.2 |\n| git2r | 0.27.1 |\n| glue | 1.4.1 |\n| here | 1.0.1 |\n| knitr | 1.33 |\n| lintr | 2.0.1 |\n| optparse | 1.6.6 |\n| plotly | 4.9.2.1 |\n| RcppRoll | 0.3.0 |\n| rhdf5 | 2.30.1 |\n| rmarkdown | 2.7 |\n| roxygen2 | 7.1.1 |\n| Rsamtools | 2.2.3 |\n| rtracklayer | 1.46.0 |\n| scales | 1.1.1 |\n| shiny | 1.5.0 |\n| ShortRead | 1.44.3 |\n| styler | 1.3.2 |\n| testthat | 3.0.1 |\n| tidyverse | 1.3.0 |\n| withr | 2.3.0 |\n| yaml | 2.2.1 |\n\n| Python Package | Version | Package Manager |\n| -------------- | ------- | --------------- |\n| biopython | 1.77 | conda |\n| cutadapt | 1.18 | conda |\n| gffutils | 0.10.1 | conda |\n| gitpython | 3.1.3 | conda |\n| h5py | 2.10.0 | conda |\n| nextflow | 20.04.1 | conda |\n| pandas | 1.0.5 | conda |\n| pycodestyle | 2.6.0 | conda |\n| pylint | 2.5.3 | conda |\n| pysam | 0.15.3 | conda |\n| pytest | 5.4.3 | conda |\n| pytest-cov | 2.10.1 | conda |\n| pyyaml | 5.3.1 | conda |\n| samtools | 1.9 | conda |\n| sphinx | 4.0.1 | conda |\n| umi_tools | 1.0.1 | conda |\n\nCertain packages are only required if you plan to develop and extend riboviz.

You just got an informative message saying that two of the base R packages couldn't be updated...\n> All of your Bioconductor packages end up in the first dir, which is writeable by you, and the base and core packages go in the second dir, which is only writeable by an administrator. You shouldn't be running R as an administrator, like ever, so it's common for you to get the message that you saw. If you really care to update the core packages, you can run R as an administrator, do biocLite, and then restart as a lower-permissioned user after the update.\n\nYou can check that it is available (your exact path may differ):\n\n```console\n$ ls ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.4/Rsamtools/\nDESCRIPTION  libs  LICENSE  Meta  NAMESPACE  NEWS\n```\n\n```console\n$ ls ~/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/3.6/Rsamtools/\nDESCRIPTION  libs  LICENSE  Meta  NAMESPACE  NEWS\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting: `Cannot allocate memory`\n\n```\nError in system2(file.path(R.home(\"bin\"), \"R\"), c(if (nzchar(arch))\npaste0(\"--arch=\",  :\n  cannot popen ' '/usr/lib/R/bin/R' --no-save --slave 2>&1 <\n  '/tmp/Rtmpw3pOH7/file12471113d0d2b'', probable reason 'Cannot\n  allocate memory'\n* removing \"/home/ubuntu/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6/Rsamtools\"\nWarning in q(\"no\", status = status, runLast = FALSE) :\n  system call failed: Cannot allocate memory\n\nThe downloaded source packages are in\n        \"/tmp/RtmpOEVbaL/downloaded_packages\"\ninstallation path not writeable, unable to update packages: foreign\nWarning message:e\nIn install.packagees(pkgs = doing, lib = lib, ...) :\n  installation of package \"Rsamtools\" had non-zero exit status\n```\n\nYou may need to assign more memory to R or your machine.\n\n### Troubleshooting: `package \"XML\" is not available`\n\nIf you get this error message when running:\n\n```R\n> BiocManager::install(\"rtracklayer\")\n```\n\nthen one solution may be to install \"XML\" specifying the URL of the source package, for example:\n\n```R\n> install.packages(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/XML/XML_3.99-0.3.tar.gz\", repos=NULL, type=\"source\")\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting: `ShortRead` installation fails on CentOS\n\nIf the following failure arises when installing `ShortRead` under CentOS:\n\n```R\n> install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n...\n> BiocManager::install(\"ShortRead\")\nWarning messages:\n1: In .inet_warning(msg) :\n  installation of package \"png\" had non-zero exit status\n2: In .inet_warning(msg) :\n  installation of package \"jpeg\" had non-zero exit status\n3: In .inet_warning(msg) :\n  installation of package \"latticeExtra\" had non-zero exit status\n4: In .inet_warning(msg) :\n  installation of package \"ShortRead\" had non-zero exit status\nInstall libjpegdevel:\n```\n\nFailure 2 causes failure 4 may be due to a missing package. To resolve this failure, install the `libjpeg-devel` package:\n\n```console\n$ sudo yum install -y libjpeg-devel\n```\n\nFailure 1 causes failures 3 and 4 and may be due to, on CentOS 7, the system-wide `libpng` package being at version 15, while Miniconda 3, after installation of the Python packages above, has `libpng` version 16. To resolve this failure, start a new bash terminal but do not activate the Miniconda environment, start R and reinstall the package:\n\n```console\n$ R\n```\n```R\n> install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n> BiocManager::install(\"ShortRead\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## Install Python\n\n| Package | Links |\n| ------- | ----- |\n| Python | [python](https://www.python.org/) |\n\nThe instructions which follow have been written for Miniconda Python. If using Anaconda then, when installing some packages, you will be told that they are already available. This is because Anaconda comes with a wide range of common Python packages.\n\nIf you are using other distributions of Python, you will need to consult the relevant documentation for each package for installation information. See also the section on [python and python3](#python-and-python3) below.\n\n**Note:** Python 3 is required. Python 2 came to the end of its supported life in 2020 and there will be no Python 2.8 (see [PEP 373 Python 2.7 Release Schedule](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/)).\n\n**Note:** Either [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) are strongly recommended.\n\n**Note:** Python 3.6, or later, is strongly recommended.\n\n### Install Miniconda Python 3.6+\n\nOn Linux, install:\n\n```console\n$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda3.sh\n$ bash miniconda3.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3\n```\n\n**Note:** Make sure you use `-O`, which provides a name for the downloaded file, and not `-o`, which provides the name of a file for messages about the download.\n\nFor Mac OS and Windows installers, go to [Miniconda installation page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n\nWhen Miniconda has installed, activate the environment:\n\n```console\n$ source $HOME/miniconda3/bin/activate\n```\n\nCreate a `riboviz` environment and activate it:\n\n```console\n$ conda create -y --name riboviz python=3.7\n$ conda activate riboviz\n$ python --version\n```\n\nYour version of Python may differ from that shown.\n\n**Troubleshooting: `...command not found...`**\n\nIf you see:\n\n```\n$ bash miniconda3.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda3\nminiconda3.sh: line 1: --2019-07-31: command not found\nminiconda3.sh: line 2: syntax error near unexpected token `('\nminiconda3.sh: line 2: `Resolving repo.continuum.io\n(repo.continuum.io)... 104.18.200.79, 104.18.201.79,\n2606:4700::6812:c94f, ...'\n```\n\nthen rerun `wget` and use `-O`, not `-o`.\n\n**Troubleshooting: incompatible Python versions**\n\nIf you find when installing packages below that your version of Python is too new (e.g. your Python version is 3.8 and the tool only works with Python 3.7), then two options are:\n\n1. See if a more recent version of the tool is available. For example a version available via `pip` may be more up-to-date than a version available via `conda`.\n2. Create a conda environment that supports a version of Python compatible with the tools.\n\n```console\n$ conda create -y --name riboviz python=<VERSION>\n```\n\n  - For example:\n\n```console\n$ conda create --name riboviz python=3.7\n```\n\n### `python` and `python3`\n\nIf you have an environment which has both `python` and `python3`, such as can arise when you are using a system that has both Python 2 and Python 3 packages centrally installed, then please note the following.\n\nThe riboviz workflow invokes both Python and R scripts. It invokes Python scripts using the command `python`. If you have a system that has both `python`, which invokes Python 2, and `python3`, which invokes Python 3, then the workflow will fail as riboviz's Python scripts are Python 3-compatible only.\n\nA workaround is to create a local `bin` directory with a symbolic link called `python` which points to Python 3 (and similarly for `pip` and `pip3`). This can be done as follows:\n\n```console\n$ mkdir ~/bin\n$ cd ~/bin\n$ ln -s $(which python3) python\n$ ln -s $(which pip3) pip\n$ cd\n```\n\nNow, when you run `python`, `python3` should be invoked. If the symlinks aren't picked up then you may need to add ~/bin to your PATH:\n\n```console\n$ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH\n```\n\nThis approach was suggested in a [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55295939) on StackOverflow's [Unable to set default python version to python3 in ubuntu](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41986507/unable-to-set-default-python-version-to-python3-in-ubuntu).\n\nWe would recommend using Miniconda, Anaconda or some other virtual environment solution for Python which provide a more usable means of managing multiple environments (including Python 2 and Python 3).\n\n---\n\n## Install Python and conda packages\n\n| Package | conda channel | Links |\n| ------- | ------------- | ----- |\n| pyyaml | default | [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/) |\n| gitpython | default | [gitpython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [GitHub](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython) |\n| pytest | default | [pytest](https://pytest.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/) |\n| pandas | default | [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) |\n| Cutadapt | bioconda | [GitHub](https://github.com/marcelm/cutadapt), [readthedocs](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/) |\n| pysam | bioconda | [GitHub](https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam/), [readthedocs](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/) |\n| Samtools | bioconda | [samtools](https://www.htslib.org/) |\n| BioPython | anaconda |[Biopython](http://biopython.org/) |\n| gffutils | bioconda | [gffutils](http://daler.github.io/gffutils/) |\n| h5py | anaconda |[h5py](https://www.h5py.org/) |\n| UMI-tools | bioconda | [GitHub](https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools), [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/umi-tools/) |\n| Nextflow | bioconda | [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), [Documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html), [GitHub](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow) |\n\n**Note:** Cutadapt v1.18 (2018-09-07), or later, is required.\n\n**Note:** Samtools 1.9 is required if running on CentOS 7.\n\n**Note:** Nextflow 20, or later, is required.\n\nInstall:\n\n```console\n$ conda install -y pyyaml\n$ conda install -y gitpython\n$ conda install -y pytest\n$ conda install -y pandas\n$ conda install -y -c bioconda cutadapt\n$ conda install -y -c bioconda pysam\n$ conda install -y -c bioconda samtools=1.9\n$ conda install -y -c anaconda biopython\n$ conda install -y -c bioconda gffutils\n$ conda install -y -c anaconda h5py\n$ conda install -y -c bioconda umi_tools\n$ conda install -y -c bioconda nextflow=20\n```\n\n\n**Note:** For some users, the workflow fails during invocation of `cutadapt` 3.2 or 3.4.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
