This predefined set is empirically decided by ASTRAL (but see tutorial on how to expand it). The current code corresponds to **ASTRAL-III** (see below for the publication).\n\n\nThe algorithm was designed by Tandy Warnow and Siavash Mirarab originally. ASTRAL-III incorporates many ideas by Chao Zhang and Maryam Rabiee.\n[Code developers](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL/graphs/contributors) are mainly Siavash Mirarab, Chao Zhang, Maryam Rabiee, and Erfan Sayyari.\n"

We have tested ASTRAL only on Linux and MAC but others have used it on Windows with no reported issues.\n* To test your installation, go to the place where you put the uncompressed ASTRAL, and run:\n\n  ``` bash\n   java -jar astral.5.7.8.jar -i test_data/song_primates.424.gene.tre\n   ```\n\n  This should quickly finish. There are also other sample input files under `test_data/` that can be used.\n\n* ASTRAL can be run from any directory (e.g., `/path/to/astral/`). Then, you just need to run:\n\n  ``` bash\n  java -jar /path/to/astral/astral.5.7.8.jar\n  ```\n\n* Also, you can move `astral.5.7.8.jar` to any location you like and run it from there, but note that you need to move the `lib` directory with it as well.\n\n"
