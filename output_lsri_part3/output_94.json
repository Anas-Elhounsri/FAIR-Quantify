In the MD-Stage, a spatial-frequency joint modality contrastive learning scheme is designed to directly decouple the modality-specific information from MRI data. To decompose tumor-specific representations and extract discriminative holistic features, we propose an affinity-guided dense tumor-region knowledge distillation mechanism in the TD-Stage through aligning the features of a disentangled binary teacher network with a holistic student network. By explicitly discovering relations among modalities and tumor regions, our model can learn sufficient information for segmentation even if some modalities are missing.\r\n\r \n"
