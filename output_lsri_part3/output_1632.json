        "value": "1. **Create and edit a parameters file**: After importing geonomics as `gnx`,\n   users can run the function `gnx.make_parameters_file()` function, feeding in\n   a series of arguments to indicate the desired number and type of landscape layers,\n   number and parameterization of species, data and statistics to be recorded, and parameters\n   file name. Users can then edit the default parameter values in the resulting file to parameterize\n   their model. Within the parameters file, they have the option of referencing external files\n   to be used by their model, including static raster files or directories of raster time series, as well\n   as a CSV file defining a custom genomic architecture. \n2. **Use the parameters file to create a model**: After setting up their parameters file, users can\n   call the `gnx.make_model()` function, providing their parameters file's name as an argument. This\n   will create a new `gnx.Model` object, containing a `gnx.Landscape` with the defined number of layers,\n   and a `gnx.Community` with the defined number of species composed of starting individuals. The landscape,\n   species, and individuals will all be described by a number of characteristics, in accordance with the values\n   defined in the parameters file. \n3. **Run the model**: Users can then call the model's `mod.run` or `mod.walk` methods, to either run their model\n   to completion or run it manually for some number of time steps. Each time step will include, as applicable,\n   movement, mating, mortality, environmental and demographic change, and data-writing operations. For more detail\n   on these operations, see the conceptual diagram that follows. \nOperations during the main phase of a Geonomics model run. In the center is a\nspecies on a multi-layer landscape that includes a selection layer (above) and\na movement and carrying capacity layer (below). Surrounding the landscape is a\nflow-diagram of the major operations during a time step. Operations in dashed\nboxes are optional. \n- **mortality**: During the mortality stage (bottom-right), deaths are modeled as a Bernoulli\n  process, with the probability of mortality being a product of density-dependence\n  and selection on all traits. \n- **changes**: During the changes stage (bottom-left), demographic change events\n  (not pictured) and environmental change events (represented as a\n  series of change rasters corresponding to scheduled time steps,\n  t1, t2, \u2026, tn), take place. \nThis package was written by Drew Ellison Terasaki Hart, as part of his PhD work.\nIt is available to freely distribute and modify, with proper\nattribution, under the MIT License.

Along with this, also added a new, optional section to the species 'init' section of the parameters file (keyed to 'msprime') which provides parameters for simulating any number of Individuals from any number of msprime populations and placing them at specified coordinates on the Landscape (replacing the gnx-simulated starting population). (Also added a convenience method, `Model.burn`, to burn in a Model, because I was getting annoyed having to type something like `Model.walk(10000, 'burn')`.)",

        "description": "Fixed the births_before_deaths issue: it was an internal parameter in demography.do_pop_dynamics, which was previously set to False, counterintutively; it made it so that gnx calculated the death-probability rasters before adding offspring to the landscape, then calculated all individuals', including offspring's, death probability from that raster; this somehow made sense to me at the time, but wound up appearing to be something that I was just overthinking, with the unfortunate result being that it allowed actual population size to exceed the target population size (i.e., the sum of the carrying capacity raster) when the n_births_distr_lambda parameter was large enough (e.g., ~>= 4). I had never noticed this before because I tend to use low values of n_births_distr_lambda anyhow. I now removed the births_before_deaths internal param completely and just fixed things so that births always happen before the calculation of the death-probability raster. I thought about adding this as a new user-facing parameter, but in the end could see no good reason to set births_before_deaths=False, so wound up just removing. I am treating this as a simple bug fix because it gets rid of a bug resulting in an artefact and does not break any legacy, but it is worth noting that some legacy code could now generate lower equilibrium population sizes than previously seen! (Nonetheless, this is unlikely to have any real scientific implications because any previous work should only have presented and assessed its results in the context of the actual mean equilibrium population size observed in simulations, rather than some theoretical equilibrium size calculated from the carrying capacity raster.)",
