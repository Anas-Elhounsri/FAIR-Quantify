This track contains problematic regions for short sequence tag signal detection (such as satellites and rRNA genes). The Duke excluded regions track was generated for the ENCODE project.\r\n\r\nThe Duke uniqueness score tracks display how unique is each sequence on the positive strand starting at a particular base and of a particular length. Thus, the 35 bp track reflects the uniqueness of all 35 base sequences with the score being assigned to the first base of the sequence. Scores are normalized to between 0 and 1 with 1 representing a completely unique sequence and 0 representing the sequence occurs >4 times in the genome (excluding chrN_random and alternative haplotypes). A score of 0.5 indicates the sequence occurs exactly twice, likewise 0.33 for three times and 0.25 for four times. For Human genome, you can use the [Duke uniqueness tracks](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/encodeDCC/wgEncodeMapability/wgEncodeDukeUniqueness35bp.wig.gz)  generated for the ENCODE project as tools in the development of the Open Chromatin tracks.

In the DREAM-ENCODE challange, each bin falls into one of the three types: bound(B), unbound(U), or ambiguous(A), which is determined from the ChIP-Seq results. Bins overlapping with peaks and passing the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) check with a threshold of 5%  are labeled as bound. Bins that overlap with peaks but fail to pass the reproducibility threshold are labeled as ambiguous. All other bins are labeled as unbound. We do not use any ambiguous bins during the training or validation process according to the common practice. Therefore, each bin in the genomic sequence will either be a positive site (bounded) or a negative site (unbounded).\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchr     start   stop    A549    H1-hESC HeLa-S3 HepG2   IMR-90  K562    MCF-7\r\nchr10   600     800     U       U       U       U       U       U       U\r\nchr10   650     850     U       U       U       U       U       U       U\r\nchr10   700     900     U       U       U       U       U       U       U\r\nchr10   750     950     U       U       U       U       U       U       U\r\nchr10   800     1000    U       U       U       U       U       U       U\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor each TF, you will need one such label file.

To do so, you would need to prepare a peak annotation file. We have provided the peak annotations as example/hg19/peak_annotation.gz for the TF and cells we used. For your own customized input, you can use data/generate_peaks.py to generate those peak annotations. Usage:\r\n\r\n`Python generate_peaks.py [gencode_path] [genome_sizes_file] [bed_file] [outfile] [narrowPeak_path] [blacklist_file] [label_path] [label_peak_path] [genome_window_size] [flanking]`\r\n\r\n[gencode_path] [genome_sizes_file] [bed_file] [outfile] are the same as described in the \"Genomic annotations\" section. \r\n\r\nnarrowPeak_path is the path you store the ChIP-Seq narrowPeak files. In our experiment, these peaks are the reproducible peaks across pseudo-replicates that pass the 10% IDR threshold. The peaks are provided in the [narrowPeak format](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format12). For each cell type and TF pair, the file  should be named as  ChIPseq.[train_cell].[tf_name].conservative.train.narrowPeak.gz'\r\n\r\n`blacklist_file` is the file you want to exclude during analysis and can be empty if you do not wish to miss any regions\r\n\r\n`label_path` is where the label files are stored. They should be located in data_dir/label/train/\r\n\r\n`label_peak_path` is where the output annotation files are stored. They should be located in data_dir/label/train_positive/\r\n\r\n`genome_window_size` is the size of each bin in your label files. In our experiment we set it to 200.\r\n\r\n`flanking` is the length of upstream and downstream region that around your training sample. In our experiment we set it to 401.\r\n\r"
