        "value": "YaHS offers some auxiliary tools to help generating HiC contact maps for visualisation. A demo is provided in the bash script `scripts/run_yahs.sh`. To generate and visualise a HiC contact map, the following tools are required.\n\n* samtools: https://github.com/samtools/samtools\n* juicer_tools: https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Download\n* Juicebox: https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox\n\nThe first step is to convert the HiC alignment file (BAM/BED/BIN) to a file required by `juicer_tools` using the tool `juicer pre` provided by YaHS. To save time, BIN file is recommended which has already been generated in the scaffolding step. Here is an example bash command:\n\n    (juicer pre hic-to-contigs.bin scaffolds_final.agp contigs.fa.fai | sort -k2,2d -k6,6d -T ./ --parallel=8 -S32G | awk 'NF' > alignments_sorted.txt.part) && (mv alignments_sorted.txt.part alignments_sorted.txt)\n\nThe tool `juicer pre` takes three positional parameters: the alignments of HiC reads to contigs, the scaffold AGP file and the contig FASTA index file. With `-o` option, it will write the results to a file. Here, the outputs are directed to `stdout` as we need a sorted (by scaffold names) file for `juicer_tools`.\n\nFor sorting, we use 8 threads, 32Gb memory and the current directory for temporaries. You might need to adjust these settings according to your device.\n\nThe next step is to generate HiC contact matrix using `juicer_tools`. Here is an example bash command:\n\n    (java -jar -Xmx32G juicer_tools.1.9.9_jcuda.0.8.jar pre alignments_sorted.txt out.hic.part scaffolds_final.chrom.sizes) && (mv out.hic.part out.hic)\n\nThe `juicer_tools`'s `pre` command takes three positional parameters: the sorted alignment file generated in the first step, the output file name and the file for scaffold sizes. The file for scaffold sizes should contain two columns - scaffold name and scaffold size, which can be taken from the first two columns of the FASTA index file.\n\nFinally, the output file `out.hic` could be used for visualisation with Juicebox. More information about `juicer_tools` and Juicebox can be found [here]( https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer/wiki/Juicer-Tools-Quick-Start).\n"

It relies on a new algothrim for contig joining detection which considers the topological distribution of Hi-C signals aiming to distingush real interaction signals from mapping nosies. YaHS has been tested in a wide range of genome assemblies. Compared to other Hi-C scaffolding tools, it usually generates more contiguous scaffolds - especially with a higher N90 and L90 statistics. It is also super fast - takes less than 5 minutes to reconstruct the human genome from an assembly of 5,483 contigs with ~45X Hi-C data. See the [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jPhSi1k4ROGb1OSfKDurFIUvn-x1G6Kg/view?usp=sharing) presented in the [Bioversity Genemics 2021 conference](https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/news_item/biodiversity-genomics-2021-sequencing-genomes-across-the-planet/) for more information.\n \n"

For example,\n    \n    juicer pre -a -o out_JBAT hic-to-contigs.bin scaffolds_final.agp contigs.fa.fai >out_JBAT.log 2>&1\n    \nwhere `hic-to-contigs.bin` (can be replaced with the original BED/BAM file with some sacrifice in running time) and `scaffolds_final.agp` are the outputs of YaHS. This results in five output files,\n\n    out_JBAT.txt             - BED format file for hic links\n    out_JBAT.liftover.agp    - coordinate file between new and old contigs\n    out_JBAT.assembly        - assembly annotation file for Juicebox\n    out_JBAT.assembly.agp    - AGP file contains same information as the assembly annotation file. Not a real AGP file as there are no gaps.\n    out_JBAT.log             - the output log file\n   \nYou will then need to run `juicer_tools pre` with `out_JBAT.txt` file.\n\n    (java -jar -Xmx32G juicer_tools.1.9.9_jcuda.0.8.jar pre out_JBAT.txt out_JBAT.hic.part <(cat out_JBAT.log  | grep PRE_C_SIZE | awk '{print $2\" \"$3}')) && (mv out_JBAT.hic.part out_JBAT.hic)\n\nThere will be a line like `[I::main_pre] JUICER_PRE CMD: java -Xmx36G -jar ${juicer_tools} pre out_JBAT.txt out_JBAT.hic <(echo \"assembly 183277074\")` in the `out_JBAT.log` file telling you how to run juicer_tools. The `<(echo \"assembly 183277074\")` part can be replaced by a chromosome size file containing only one line - assembly 183277074.\n\nThe `out_JBAT.hic` can be loaded into Juicebox along with `out_JBAT.assembly` for manual editing.\n> **_NOTE 3:_**  if your total assembly size is larger than 2Gb, there will be a scale factor applied to the HiC contact map file to make it loadable by Juicebox. This scale factor can be found in the log file (out_JBAT.log) and always a power of two, e. g. `[I::main_pre] scale factor: 4`. You need to set this parameter in Juicebox through `Assembly > Set Scale`. Otherwise the HiC contact map and assembly file will not match.\n    \nOnce completed editing, there should be a file named something like `out_JBAT.review.assembly` generated by Juicebox, which can be fed into `juicer post` command to generate AGP and FASTA files for the final genome assembly. You also need the `out_JBAT.liftover.agp` coordinate file previously generated with `juicer pre` command.\n\n    juicer post -o out_JBAT out_JBAT.review.assembly out_JBAT.liftover.agp contigs.fa\n\nThis will end up with two files `out_JBAT.FINAL.agp` and `out_JBAT.FINAL.fa`. Together with `hic-to-contigs.bin` or the original BED/BAM file, you can regenerate a HiC contact map for the final assembly as described in the previous section.\n\nYou can find more information about manual editing with Juicebox [here](https://www.dnazoo.org/methods) and [Issue 4](https://github.com/c-zhou/yahs/issues/4).\n"

        "description": "Major changes in this release.\r\n\r\n1. Improved compatibility with AGP specifications. The default component type is now 'U' (previously 'N'). The default gap size is now 100 (previously 200). The default linkage evidence is now 'proximity_ligation' ( previously 'na'). These defaults can be adjusted using parameters '--gap-ctype', '--gap-size' and '--gap-link', respectively. For more details, refer to the full help message by running `yahs -?`.\r\n\r\n2. The scaffolding logic has been updated. In previous versions, the scaffolding process would stop if the N50 was too small for a given resolution. Now, the process will attempt additional rounds of scaffolding at the previous resolution level and will only terminate if there are still no significant improvements.\r\n\r\n3. A new '-R' option has been added to control the number of rounds to run at each resolution level.\r\n\r\n4. The behavior of the '-a' option has been changed. In previous versions, when an AGP file was provided for rescaffolding, contig error correction was not performed by default. Now, contig error correction is enabled by default.\r\n\r\n5. A telomeric sequence identification module has been integrated to detect chromosome ends. Sequences identified as telomeric will be prevented from joining other sequences. YaHS includes a default telomeric motif database (you can view the list by running `yahs --print-telo-motifs`). The `--telo-motif` option can be used to specify a custom telomeric motif. When this option is set, only the specified motif will be checked. The code for telomere identification was adopted from [seqtk telo](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk).",

        "description": "In this release, the mapping quality score is added to the binary file, which makes the BIN files generated with the previous versions not compatible anymore. If you see error messages indicating the BIN file is not valid, you need to run YaHS with a BED or BAM file to regenerate a BIN file.\r\n\r\nThis change mainly aims to reduce false-positive contig breaks in repetitive regions. When mapping quality filtering is applied, the HiC coverage in these regions is usually low, leading to excessive contig breaks. It is therefore highly recommended to keep low mapping quality reads in the YaHS input file. All the reads will be used in the contig error detection stage. In the scaffolding stage, the parameter `-q` (10 by default) is applied to select valid read pairs.",

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "YaHS has two required inputs: a FASTA format file with contig sequences which need to be indexed (with [samtools faidx](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-faidx.html) for example) and a BAM/BED/BIN/PA5 file with the alignment results of Hi-C reads to the contigs. There are many pipelines available to generate the alignment file such as the [Arima Genomics' mapping pipeline](https://github.com/ArimaGenomics/mapping_pipeline), the [Omni-C's mapping pipeline](https://omni-c.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [HiC-Pro](https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro). The BAM file is recommened to mark PCR/optical duplicates before feeding to YaHS. Several tools are available out there for marking duplicates such as `bammarkduplicates2` from [biobambam2](https://bio.tools/biobambam) and `MarkDuplicates` from [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). For BED format input, each line should contain at least four columns, i.e., the contig name the read mapped to, the start position of the alignment, the end position of the alignment and the read name. The first and second read from a read pair is optionally marked by '/1' and '/2' suffix to the read name. The fifth column will be treated as the mapping quality score if they are numeric values. All the information after the fifth column are ignored. Each read pair should be placed in two consecutive lines (i.e., the BED file should be sorted by the first column). The BED format file can be generated from the BAM file with [bedtools bamtobed](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/bamtobed.html) for example. There is no need to convert the BAM format to BED format unless you want to compare YaHS to other tools. YaHS also accepts pair format input (PA5). Each line in a pair format file should at least contain five columns containing the mapping information of a read pair, i.e., the read pair name, the contig name the first read mapped to, the mapping position the of the first read, the contig name the second read mapped to, and the mapping position of the second read. The sixth and seventh column will be treated as mapping quality scores for the first and second reads respectively if they are numeric values. All the information after the seventh column are ignored. The BIN format is a binary format specific to YaHS. If the input file is not BIN format, the first step of YaHS is to convert them to BIN format. This is to save running time as multiple rounds of file IO are needed during the scaffolding process. If you have run YaHS and need to rerun it, the BIN file in the output directory could be reused to save some time - although might be just a few minutes. YaHS determines the input file format from file name extensions (case insensitive): `.bam` for BAM files, `.bed` for BED files, `.pa5` for pair format files and `.bin` for BIN files. YaHS also provides the parameter `--file-type` to allow specification of input file format. Accepted values include BAM, BED, PA5 and BIN (case insensitive). This parameter has to be set when using pipe in as input where file name extension detection will fail.\n\n> **_NOTE 1:_** The input BAM could either sorted by read names ([samtools sort](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-sort.html) with `-n` option) or not. The behaviours of the program are slightly different, which might lead to slightly different scaffolding results. For a BAM input sorted by read names, with each mapped read pair, a Hi-C link is counted between the middle positions of the read alignments; while for a BAM input sorted by coordinates or unsorted, Hi-C links are counted between the start positions of the read alignments. Also, for a BAM input not sorted by read names, the mapping quality filtering is suppressed (`-q` option).\n\n> **_NOTE 2:_** The BAM file used to genereate BED file need to be filtered out unmapped reads, supplementary/secondary alignment records, and PCR/optical duplicates, and sorted by read names (otherwise the resulted BED file need to be sorted by the read name column).\n\nHere is an example to run YaHS,\n\n    yahs contigs.fa hic-to-contigs.bam\n\nThe outputs include several [AGP format](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/) files and a FASTA format file. The `*_inital_break_[0-9]{2}.agp` AGP files are for initial assembly error corrections. The `*_r[0-9]{2}.agp` and related `*_r[0-9]{2}_break.agp` AGP files are for scaffolding results in each round. The `*_scaffolds_final.agp` and `*_scaffolds_final.fa` files are for the final scaffolding results.\n\nThere are some optional parameters.\n\nWith `-o` option, you can specify the prefix of the output files. It is `./yash.out` by default. If a directory structure is included, the directory needs to be existed.\n\nWith `-a` option, you can specify a AGP format file to ask YaHS to do scaffolding with the scaffolds in the AGP file as the start point.\n\nWith `-r` option, you can specify a range of resultions (in ascending order). It is `10000,20000,50000,100000,200000,500000,1000000,2000000,5000000,10000000,20000000,50000000,100000000,200000000,500000000` by default and the upper limit is automatically adjusted by the genome size. For highly fragmented genome assemblies, you can try to start with higher resultions by adding smaller `-r` values.\n\nWith `-R` option, you can specify the number of rounds to run for each resolution level.\n\nWith `-e` option, you can specify the restriction enzyme(s) used by the Hi-C experiment. For example, `GATC` for the DpnII restriction enzyme used by the Dovetail Hi-C Kit; `GATC,GANTC` and `GATC,GANTC,CTNAG,TTAA` for Arima genomics 2-enzyme and 4-enzyme protocol, respectively. Sometimes, the specification of enzymes may not change the scaffolding result very much if not make it worse, especially when the base quality of the assembly is not very good, e.g., assembies constructed from noisy long reads.\n\nWith `-l` option, you can specify the minimum contig length included for scaffolding.\n\nWith `-q` option, you can set the minimum read mapping quality.\n\nWith `--no-contig-ec` option, you can skip the initial assembly error correction step. With `-a` option, this will be set automatically.\n\nWith `--no-scaffold-ec` option, YaHS will skip the scaffolding error check in each round. There will be no `*_r[0-9]{2}_break.agp` AGP output files.\n\nWith `--no-mem-check` option, the runtime memory check is disabled. When running out of memory, the scaffolding process will terminate immediately instead of try lower resolutions.\n\nWith `--file-type` option, you can specify the input file format. It has to be set when in the input is pipe in.\n\nWith `--read-length` option, you can specify the read length of your HiC data. This is only required and used when the input is in pair format.\n\nWith `--telo-motif` option, you can specify a telomeric motif. This will be used to identify telomeric sequences on each input sequences. Sequences representing telomeric ends will not be allowed to join with other sequences. YaHS maintains a telomeric motif database as default (run `yahs --print-telo-motifs` to print a list the motifs). If this option is set, only this motif will be checked. The code for telomere identification was adopted from [seqtk telo](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk).\n\nYaHS also allows customizations of the output AGP file, such as changing the scaffold gap size, linkage evidence etc. See the long help message (`yahs -?`) and the [AGP specification documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification) for details.\n"
