        "value": "OutbreakFinder is written in Java and compiled into a standalone executable jar file, which can be executed in the Java Runtime Environment 1.8 or later version. Users can also download the source code and compile it into a preferred version. OutbreakFinder can be freely downloaded from https://github.com/skypes/Newton-method-MDS\n\n<h2>Environmental Requirement</h2>\nJdk 1.8 or later\n\n<h2>Quick Start</h2>\nThere are four examples in the examples directory, such as example_lyve-set, example_mafft, example_parsnp and example_simple. Users can easily modify these examples to suit their needs. These examples can be executed using following commands:\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar parameters.txt</pre>\n\n<h2>How to run</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A Simple Example<br>\nThe following is a simple example to generate MDS figure by using a distance matrix file. The format of matrix file shows as following:\n\n<pre>,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n0,0,1,6,9,9,36,38,32,33,38,45\n1,1,0,4,9,7,38,34,15,36,41,38\n2,6,4,0,3,7,37,38,39,20,41,34\n3,9,9,3,0,6,35,20,33,38,32,35\n4,9,7,7,6,0,34,38,36,37,31,36\n5,36,38,37,35,34,0,3,6,8,7,9\n6,38,34,38,20,38,3,0,4,6,8,9\n7,32,15,39,33,36,6,4,0,6,9,9\n8,33,36,20,38,37,8,6,6,0,3,4\n9,38,41,41,32,31,7,8,9,3,0,2\n10,45,38,34,35,36,9,9,9,4,2,0</pre>\n\nNote: The distance matrix must be save as a csv file format.<br/>\n\nTwo steps to generate MDS figure:<br/>\nStep 1. Create a distance matrix, named simple_ matrix.csv, using above distance data.<br/>\nStep 2. Issue following command to generate MDS figure:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar matrix=path_to_matrix_file/simple_matrix.csv dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\nTo generate MDS figure with colored data points, we just need to provide a color map file. The format of color map file is shown as following (tab-separated):<br/>\n<pre>\n0\t#00FF00\n1\t#00FF00\n2\t#00FF00\n3\t#00FF00\n4\t#00FF00\n5\t#FF0000\n6\t#FF0000\n7\t#FF0000\n8\t#FF0000\n9\t#FF0000\n10\t#FF0000\n</pre>\n\nSave above color map as a file (named color.map), and issues following command to generate MDS figure:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar matrix=path_to_matrix_file/simple_matrix.csv color=path_to_color_map/color.map dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Example for generating MDS by using multiple alignment results (Clustal Omega)<br>\nBefore generating MDS figure, a multiple sequence alignment file must be prepared. We can issue following command to generating MDS figure (the multiple sequence alignment file named msa.ma):<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=multiAlignment msa=path_to_msa_file/msa.ma matrix=path_to_matrix_file\\simple_matrix.csv dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\nYou just need to give a color map file to get a MDS graphic with colored data points, the command show as following:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=multiAlignment msa=path_to_msa_file/msa.ma matrix=path_to_matrix_file\\simple_matrix.csv color=path_to_color_map\\color.map dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Example for generating MDS by using SNP distance matrix from lyve-set<br/>\nBefore generating MDS graphic, a SNP distance matrix file must be prepared, the file name often should be out.pairwiseMatrix.tsv. We can issue following command to generating MDS plot:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=lyve-set pairwiseMatrix=path_to_SNP_file/out.pairwiseMatrix.tsv dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Example for generating MDS by using multiple alignment result from Parsnp<br/>\nBefore plotting MDS figure, a Parsnp multiple alignment file must be prepared (the file named parsnp.xmfa). We can issue following command to plot MDS figure: <br/>\n  <pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=parsnp xmfa=path_to_parsnp_file/parsnp.xmfa dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Affinity Propagation<br/>\nAll of MDS coordinate file, file extension with coods, can be cluster by affinity propagation.

The format of matrix file shows as following:\n\n<pre>,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\n0,0,1,6,9,9,36,38,32,33,38,45\n1,1,0,4,9,7,38,34,15,36,41,38\n2,6,4,0,3,7,37,38,39,20,41,34\n3,9,9,3,0,6,35,20,33,38,32,35\n4,9,7,7,6,0,34,38,36,37,31,36\n5,36,38,37,35,34,0,3,6,8,7,9\n6,38,34,38,20,38,3,0,4,6,8,9\n7,32,15,39,33,36,6,4,0,6,9,9\n8,33,36,20,38,37,8,6,6,0,3,4\n9,38,41,41,32,31,7,8,9,3,0,2\n10,45,38,34,35,36,9,9,9,4,2,0</pre>\n\nNote: The distance matrix must be save as a csv file format.<br/>\n\nTwo steps to generate MDS figure:<br/>\nStep 1. Create a distance matrix, named simple_ matrix.csv, using above distance data.<br/>\nStep 2. Issue following command to generate MDS figure:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar matrix=path_to_matrix_file/simple_matrix.csv dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\nTo generate MDS figure with colored data points, we just need to provide a color map file. The format of color map file is shown as following (tab-separated):<br/>\n<pre>\n0\t#00FF00\n1\t#00FF00\n2\t#00FF00\n3\t#00FF00\n4\t#00FF00\n5\t#FF0000\n6\t#FF0000\n7\t#FF0000\n8\t#FF0000\n9\t#FF0000\n10\t#FF0000\n</pre>\n\nSave above color map as a file (named color.map), and issues following command to generate MDS figure:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar matrix=path_to_matrix_file/simple_matrix.csv color=path_to_color_map/color.map dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Example for generating MDS by using multiple alignment results (Clustal Omega)<br>\nBefore generating MDS figure, a multiple sequence alignment file must be prepared. We can issue following command to generating MDS figure (the multiple sequence alignment file named msa.ma):<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=multiAlignment msa=path_to_msa_file/msa.ma matrix=path_to_matrix_file\\simple_matrix.csv dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\nYou just need to give a color map file to get a MDS graphic with colored data points, the command show as following:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=multiAlignment msa=path_to_msa_file/msa.ma matrix=path_to_matrix_file\\simple_matrix.csv color=path_to_color_map\\color.map dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Example for generating MDS by using SNP distance matrix from lyve-set<br/>\nBefore generating MDS graphic, a SNP distance matrix file must be prepared, the file name often should be out.pairwiseMatrix.tsv. We can issue following command to generating MDS plot:<br/>\n<pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=lyve-set pairwiseMatrix=path_to_SNP_file/out.pairwiseMatrix.tsv dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Example for generating MDS by using multiple alignment result from Parsnp<br/>\nBefore plotting MDS figure, a Parsnp multiple alignment file must be prepared (the file named parsnp.xmfa). We can issue following command to plot MDS figure: <br/>\n  <pre>java -jar OutbreakFinder.jar mode=parsnp xmfa=path_to_parsnp_file/parsnp.xmfa dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n<li><p>Affinity Propagation<br/>\nAll of MDS coordinate file, file extension with coods, can be cluster by affinity propagation. We can issue following command to plot MDS figure, which clustered by affinity propagation:<br/>\n<pre>java -cp OutbreakFinder.jar utils.AffinityPropagation -label coods=path_to_coods dist=path_to_dist</pre>\n\n\n"
