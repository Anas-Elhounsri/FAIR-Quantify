Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of\nactions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent\nban.\n\n### 3.

This output format contains a list of all unaligned sequence due to: (i) unrelated sequence, (ii) failure to extend past match (MUM) boundaries/sensitivity limitations, and (iii) subset relationships. This output file is further described in the documentation --> http://harvest.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.\n- Updated MUMi parameter to allow for setting a maximum MUMi value to enable bypassing the distribution cutoff\n\n#### Bug fixes\n- Fixed minor bug when parsing multiple GenBank files for harvesttools annotation import\n- Updated branch lengths via harvest-tools \n- Fixed bug that produced VCF output without repeat filtering, even if enabled\n- Fixed issue where empty fasta file was causing index errors\n- Fixed exit code to be 0 on \u2013h (Issue #4)\n- Updated docs to indicate CXXFLAGS=\u2019-fopenmp\u2019 must be provided to configure for openmp support\n- Added support for harvesttools v1.2 (see: https://github.com/marbl/harvest-tools/releases/tag/v1.2)\n\n#### Changes\n- Added \u2013V, --version parameter\n- Allow columns with Ns to be marked as pass in VCF\n- Allow any fasta file present in -d, regardless of extension, to be used\n- Disallow genome file names containing spaces or the following special characters:  . , [ ] { } ( ) ! ; \" ' \\* ? < > | \n- Default repeat filtering disabled, removing NUCmer dependency. Repeat filtering still possible via bed format support and harvest-tools; see harvesttools documentation for further details.\n",
