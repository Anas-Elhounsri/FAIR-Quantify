ProteinBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks. ProteinBERT is built on Keras/TensorFlow. \nProteinBERT's deep-learning architecture is inspired by BERT, but contains several innovations such as  global-attention layers that have linear complexity for sequence length (compared to self-attention's quadratic/n^2 growth). As a result, the model can process protein sequences of almost any length, including extremely long protein sequences (of over tens of thousands of amino acids). \nThe model takes protein sequences as inputs, and can also take protein GO annotations as additional inputs (to help the model infer about the function of the input protein and update its internal representations and outputs accordingly).\nThis package provides access to a pretrained model produced by training for 28 days over ~670M records (~6.4 epochs over the entire UniRef90 training dataset of ~106M proteins). The package also includes scripts for pretraining the model from scratch and extracting the relevant data. \n"

If you are planning to evaluate your model on certain downstream benchmarks, it is recommended that any UniRef record similar to a test-set protein in these benchmark will be considered part of the pretraining's test set. You can use BLAST to find all of these UniRef records and provide them to *set_h5_testset* through the flag ``--uniprot-ids-file=./uniref_90_seqs_matching_test_set_seqs.txt``, where the provided text file contains the UniProt IDs of the relevant records, one per line (e.g. *A0A009EXK6_ACIBA*).\n```sh\nset_h5_testset --h5-dataset-file=./dataset.h5\n```\n    \n    \n \n"

(You can also get local/position level embeddings, and fine tune the ProteinBERT model itself on your task).\n\n```\nfrom proteinbert import load_pretrained_model\nfrom proteinbert.conv_and_global_attention_model import get_model_with_hidden_layers_as_outputs\n\npretrained_model_generator, input_encoder = load_pretrained_model()\nmodel = get_model_with_hidden_layers_as_outputs(pretrained_model_generator.create_model(seq_len))\nencoded_x = input_encoder.encode_X(seqs, seq_len)\nlocal_representations, global_representations = model.predict(encoded_x, batch_size=batch_size)\n# ... use these as features for other tasks, based on local_representations, global_representations\n```\nHave a look at the notebook used to finetune the model on a large set of diverse tasks and benchmarks for more usage examples:\n[ProteinBERT demo](https://github.com/nadavbra/protein_bert/blob/master/ProteinBERT%20demo.ipynb).\n\nYou can also download  directly from Huggingface as a Keras model: https://huggingface.co/GrimSqueaker/proteinBERT\n\n"
