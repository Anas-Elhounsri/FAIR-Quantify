        "description": "## [2.0.0] - 2023-09-03\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a major refactoring of the ProLIF codebase introducing new features, but also breaking changes:\r\n\r\n- Visualisation functions are now available through the `Fingerprint` object: `plot_3d`, `plot_barcode`, `plot_lignetwork`. A `prolif.display_residues` function is also available for easier debugging of structure preparation.\r\n- Fingerprint objects now store interaction metadata: distances, angles, and atom indices, accessible through `Fingerprint.ifp`.\r\n- ProLIF can now generate count-vectors if requested to (i.e. enumerate all the occurrences of an interaction instead of stopping at the first one) by specifying `Fingerprint(count=True)`.\r\n- A new `parameters` argument in the `Fingerprint` class allows providing custom parameters for interactions (rather than having to create new interaction classes).\r\n- The tutorials have been rewritten and reorganized.\r\n- The multiprocessing backend has been switched to `multiprocess` and `dill` for better support in notebooks.\r\n- Refer to the `Removed` section for a list of breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Added a `display_residues` function to quickly visualize the residues in a `Molecule`\r\n  object.\r\n- Added a `Complex3D` class for plotting interactions in 3D. Added the corresponding\r\n  `Fingerprint.plot_3d` method to generate the plot directly from an FP object.\r\n- Added a `Barcode` class for plotting interactions. Added the corresponding\r\n  `Fingerprint.plot_barcode` method to generate the plot directly from an FP object.\r\n- Added a `count` argument in `Fingerprint`. If `count=True`, enumerates all groups of\r\n  atoms that satisfy interaction constraints (instead of stopping at the first one),\r\n  allowing users to generate a count-fingerprint. The `Fingerprint.to_dataframe` method\r\n  has been modified accordingly, and a `Fingerprint.to_countvectors` method has been\r\n  added to generate a list of RDKit's `UIntSparseIntVect` from the count-fingerprint.\r\n  The visualisation scripts have been updated to display the occurence with the shortest\r\n  distance when a count-fingerprint is being used.\r\n- Added a `parameters` argument in `Fingerprint` to easily update the parameters used\r\n  by an interaction, instead of defining a new interaction class (Issue #118).\r\n- Added new abstract interaction classes `SingleAngle` and `DoubleAngle` to more easily\r\n  create custom interactions.\r\n- Added the `vdwradii` parameter to the `VdWContact` interaction class to update the\r\n  radii it uses.\r\n- Added the `Fingerprint.plot_lignetwork` method to generate a `LigNetwork` plot directly.\r\n- Added `LigNetwork.from_fingerprint` to generate the ligplot from a `Fingerprint`\r\n  instance. Added a `display_all` parameter for displaying all interactions instead\r\n  of only the shortest one for a given pair of residues. Added `use_coordinates` and\r\n  `flatten_coordinates` to control how the ligand structure is displayed.\r\n- Added support for displaying peptides with the `LigNetwork`.\r\n- Added `Fingerprint.metadata` to generate a dictionary containing metadata about\r\n  interactions between two residues. Replaces `Fingerprint.bitvector_atoms`.\r\n- Added a `vicinity_cutoff` parameter in `Fingerprint` to control the distance cutoff\r\n  used to automatically restrict the IFP calculation to residues within the specified\r\n  range of the ligand.\r\n- Added a `metadata` method to the base `Interaction` class to easily generate metadata\r\n  for custom interactions.\r\n- Added an `Interaction.invert_class` classmethod to easily invert the role of the\r\n  ligand and protein residues in an interaction, e.g. to create a donor class from an\r\n  acceptor class.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- The tutorials have been overhauled and should now be much easier to navigate.\r\n- The multiprocessing and pickling backends have been switched to `multiprocess` and\r\n  `dill` respectively, and the parallel implementation has been improved. Users should\r\n  now be able to define custom interactions in Jupyter notebooks, IPython and so on\r\n  without any issue (Issue #117, Issue #86).\r\n- The `LigNetwork` plot now displays the distance for each interaction on mouse hover.\r\n- Changed the format of the `Fingerprint.ifp` attribute to be a dictionary indexed by\r\n  frame/structure index. The values are custom `IFP` dictionaries that can be more\r\n  easily indexed by using residue identifier strings (e.g. `ALA216.A`) rather than\r\n  `ResidueId` objects. Each entry contains complete interaction metadata instead of just\r\n  atom indices.\r\n- All interaction classes now return more complete details about the interaction (e.g.\r\n  distances, angles, atom indices in the residue and parent molecule).\r\n- Changed the default color for `VanDerWaals` interactions in the builtin plots.\r\n- Converting the IFP to a dataframe with atom indices has been optimized and now runs\r\n  about 5 times faster (Issue #112, PR #113 by @ReneHamburger1993). *Note: discarded*\r\n  *by the subsequent updates to the codebase which removed the ability to have*\r\n  *atom indices in the dataframe.*\r\n- Various changes related to packaging, code formatting, linting and CI pipelines\r\n  (PR #114).\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n- Fixed pickling properties on RDKit molecules for Windows.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- Removed the `return_atoms` argument in `Fingerprint.to_dataframe`. Users should\r\n  directly use `Fingerprint.ifp` instead (the documentation's tutorials have been\r\n  updated accordingly).\r\n- Removed the `Fingerprint.bitvector_atoms` method, replaced by `Fingerprint.metadata`.\r\n- Removed the `__wrapped__` attribute on interaction methods that are available\r\n  from the `Fingerprint` object. These methods now accept a `metadata` parameter\r\n  instead.\r\n- Removed `LigNetwork.from_ifp` in favor of `LigNetwork.from_fingerprint`.\r\n- Removed the `match3D` parameter in `LigNetwork`. Replaced by `use_coordinates` and\r\n  `flatten_coordinates` to give users more control and allow them to provide their own\r\n  2D coordinates.",

It\r\n  now returns a dataframe with the correct number of frames in the index and no column.",
