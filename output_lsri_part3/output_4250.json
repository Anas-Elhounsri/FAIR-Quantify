Text files are provided without corresponding annotations.\n\nThe included `run_demo_experiments.sh` script (written for Bash execution on a Unix machine) utilizes the provided make targets to run a complete end-to-end experiment, with the following steps:\n\n1. Tokenize both labeled and unlabeled datasets, using SpaCy and WordPiece.\n2. Generate contextualized embedding features for each dataset, using ELMo and BERT.\n3. Train HARE models on the labeled dataset, using static embeddings, ELMo, and BERT.\n4. Use the trained models to get predictions on the unlabeled dataset.\n5. Prepare all output predictions for viewing in the front-end interface.\n"
