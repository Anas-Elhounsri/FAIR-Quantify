        "description": "This release is the first where pslivar (parallel slivar) is well tested. It handles running slivar expr in parallel (by genomic region) see [wiki page](https://github.com/brentp/slivar/wiki/parallel-slivar) for more detail.\r\n\r\nThis also adds `INFO.genic` for VCFs that have been annotated with VEP, snpEff, or bcftools. This complements `INFO.impactful`, but mainly adds `synonymous` variants to consideration. See [the wiki](https://github.com/brentp/slivar/wiki/impactful) for more detail.\r\n\r\nFull changes below:\r\nv0.1.11\r\n=======\r\n+ gnotate: ~10-20% speed improvement by inlining cmp in binarysearch\r\n+ slivar expr: fix counts in summary table when some families in the cohort have no affected samples\r\n+ slivar tsv: improve readability when 1 or both parents are missing\r\n+ slivar tsv: fix comma separation with 1 or both parents missing (thanks @brwnj for reporting)\r\n+ slivar ddc: when looking at all chromosomes, skip X, Y\r\n+ slivar expr: add --exclude option which takes a bed file of exclude regions\r\n+ slivar compound-hets: default will now output compound-het pairs that include synonymous variants \r\n+ pslivar: fix tsv output from pslivar (which allows running slivar in parallel). more info [here](https://github.com/brentp/slivar/wiki/parallel-slivar)\r\n+ add `INFO.genic` boolean to complement `INFO.impactful`. By default this includes all impacts included by `impactful` along with\r\n  synonymous and other exonic, but non-protein-altering variants (but does not include `intronic`.

        "description": "v0.1.5\r\n======\r\n+ !!MAJOR: fix bug with `hom_alt` alias for `alts == 2`. Since v0.1.3, `hom_alt` would not get set to false for samples, variants after being set once. coding using e.g.` kid.alts == 2` is not affected by this bug.\r\n+ update [wiki](https://github.com/brentp/slivar/wiki/rare-disease#full-analysis-for-trios-with-unaffected-parents) to simplify rare disease analysis.\r\n+ tune javascript in [my.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brentp/slivar/master/js/my.js) and rare-disease expressions so that many analyses will run\r\n  better than twice as fast.\r\n+ [expr] add `--skip-non-variable` which further improves speed by not evaluating javascript for a trio if all members are hom-ref or unknown (but can the same variant will\r\n  still be evlauated for trios with at least 1 sample that has a variant at that site.\r\n+ [compound-het] major speed increase for large cohorts. \r\n+ [compound-het] remove -i/--index option as this is now discovered from the header for the CSQ/BCSQ field.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### binaries and docker\r\n\r\n+ [`slivar_static`](https://github.com/brentp/slivar/releases/download/v0.1.5/slivar_static) is a completely static binary. you can download it and use it without any other software.

        "description": "this release is a huge set of changes that brings `slivar` to what will likely be it's full set of functionality.\r\n\r\nthere are substantial improvements to the docs, including several [wiki pages](https://github.com/brentp/slivar/wiki) describing components of slivar in detail.\r\n\r\none key feature of slivar is annotation (called gnotation). this release allows users to create their own gnotation\r\ndatabases that allow very fast annotation. For example [spliceai](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418316295) provides a 2.2GB file of scores for variants in the exome. `slivar` can reduce this to 536MB and use it to annotate at ~120K variants/second.\r\n\r\nThe gnomad zip files reduce exome+genome from a total of ~500GB of data to ~2GB.\r\n\r\nUsers can create their own gnotation files, but we provide:\r\n+ gnomad for hg37 with AF popmax, numhomalts (total and controls only [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/slivar/gnomad.hg37.zip)\r\n+ gnomad for hg38 with AF popmax, numhomalts (total and controls only [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/slivar/gnomad.hg38.zip)\r\n+ spliceai scores (maximum value of the 4 scores in spliceai) [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/slivar/spliceai.hg37.zip)\r\n\r\nThere are 2 binaries for this release.
