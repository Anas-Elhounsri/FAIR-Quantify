Do try to\nlook through the documentation first if something is unclear, and let us know how we can\ndo better.\n\n  * Ask a question on the [dcmqi google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dcmqi)\n  * Submit a feature request or bug, or add to the discussion on the [dcmqi issue tracker](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/issues)\n  * Submit a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/pulls) to improve dcmqi or its documentation\n\nWe encourage a range of Pull Requests, from patches that include passing tests and\ndocumentation, all the way down to half-baked ideas that launch discussions.\n\nThe PR Process, Continuous Integration, and Related Gotchas\n----------------------------------------------\n\n#### How to submit a PR ?\n\nIf you are new to dcmqi development and you don't have push access to the dcmqi\nrepository, here are the steps:\n\n1. [Fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.\n3. Create a branch.\n4. [Push](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) the branch to your GitHub fork.\n5. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/pulls).\n\nThis corresponds to the `Fork & Pull Model` mentioned in the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)\nguides.\n\nIf you have push access to dcmqi repository, you could simply push your branch\ninto the main repository and create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/QIICR/dcmqi/pulls). This corresponds to the\n`Shared Repository Model` and will facilitate other developers to checkout your\ntopic without having to [configure a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).\nIt will also simplify the workflow when you are _co-developing_ a branch.\n\nBased on the comments posted by the reviewers of your PR, you may have to revisit your patches.\n\n#### How to integrate a PR ?\n\nGetting your contributions integrated is relatively straightforward, here\nis the checklist:\n\n* All tests pass\n* Consensus is reached. This usually means that at least one reviewer approved your contribution\nand a reasonable amount of time passed without anyone objecting.\n\nNext, there are two scenarios:\n* You do NOT have push access: A dcmqi core developer will integrate your PR.\n* You have push access: Simply click on the \"Merge pull request\" button.\n\nThen, click on the \"Delete branch\" button that appears afterward.\n\n#### Automatic testing of pull requests\n\nEvery pull request is tested automatically using continuous integration using GitHub Actions\neach time you push a commit to it. No PR should be merged until all CI are green, unless there is\na good reason to merge it first (as an example, proper testing cannot be done due to the references of\n  the components that are changing, but must be available in the `master` branch).\n\n#### Documentation updates\n\nIf you contribute a change that will add a new module/function to dcmqi, you are encouraged\nto add documentation of the new feature. We use [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/fedorov/dcmqi/details) for\nmaintaining dcmqi documentation.\n"

As a result, the user is no longer required (or allowed) to specify this attribute in the metadata JSON.\r\n* minor fixes to the schema JSONs\r\n* more tests added\r\n* cleanup of CLI XML to improve consistency of the labels and fix semantics of the parameters\r\n* add dcmqi gitter channel - you can now chat with us on gitter (follow gitter badge in README)",
