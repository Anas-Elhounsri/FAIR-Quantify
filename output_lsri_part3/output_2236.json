Then, the following commands will set up the necessary channels for Bioconda and metaQuantome. If needed, additional information on Bioconda is available at https://bioconda.github.io/.\n\n```\nconda config --add channels defaults\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\n```\n\nThen, run the following command to set up an environment named mqome, which will have metaQuantome (version 2.0.2) and all dependencies in it:\n\n```\nconda create -n mqome metaquantome=2.0.2\n```\n\nIf the following prompt is seen at the command line, type `y`:\n```\nProceeed ([y]/n)?\n```\n\nThe create command only needs to be run once.\n\nFinally, we can activate the environment using the following command, which will make the `metaquantome` command available.\n```\nconda activate mqome\n```\n"
