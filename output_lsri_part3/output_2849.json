Specifically, this tool was designed to provide users with a robust metric when assessing efficiency of different optical clearing methods in brain organoids. However, the tool can be used on any kind fluorescent microscopy image, i.e. where users want to compare image quality across the whole stack. \nWe base our algorithm on previous work regarding the use of Fourier ring correlation in electron _(1,2)_ and fluorescent microscopy _(3-5)_. Generally, correlating frequencies of two images describing the same object can be used to estimate the resolution of these images. We take advantage of the fact that consecutive image planes along the z-axis are very similar due to the axial extent of the PSF. Hence, integrating the correlation between two z-slices over all frequencies gives a robust quality metric, with low frequency correlation indicating low image quality. \nThe FRC-QE plugin is part of the BigStitcher update site that can be downloaded via the Fiji Updater. Go to ```Help > Update \u2026```, click BASH2* and select BigStitcher in the list. Then click BASH3* and restart Fiji. You will now find the FRC-QE plugin under BASH4*. \nTest data that we acquired to benchmark the method can be downloaded from zenodo [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4604685#.YE-b8-Yo-u4).\n<br />\n<br /> \nFor FRC-QE to run properly, you first need to open a three-dimensional image stack in Fiji.\nIf you want to run the algorithm only on a small part of your image, simply draw a rectangular ROI around the region you want to quantify. This can be helpful when the image data is particularly large or contains imaging artifacts you want to exclude from the analysis. \nAfter selecting the image you want to process, you can also chose the method you want to use to assess image quality over your 3D stack. Besides FRC-QE, you can also compare this measure against variations of the images Shannon entropy, an algorithm that has been previously used for image compression and autofocus _(6)_.  \n* _**(a)**_\tIf you want integrate over the whole image select \u201cEntire image\u201d. \n* _**(b)**_\tIf you want to only look at a small part of the image please select _\u201cUse selected 2D ROI\u201d_ and the algorithm will only run on the previously selected ROI.\n* _**(c)**_\tIf you want to exclude certain z-slices within the stack, you can also draw a 3D ROI (_\u201cDefine interactively (3D with BDV)\u201d_). \nTo better average the FRC within one image plane, we implemented FRC-QE in a block-wise manner, where individual blocks of planes adjacent to the plane of interest are compared. By splitting the image into smaller blocks, we diminish the influence of small imaging artifacts on the final result. After calculating the FRC-QE for the individual blocks, we take the median of all blocks within one image as final quality score. The FFT size defines the size of these blocks in pixels. E.g. if you have a 400x400 px image, setting the FFT size to 200, will lead to 4 equally sized blocks of 200x200 px each. Smaller blocks will give more localized quality \ninformation, but are also more susceptible to noise. \n**Note that in order to be able to compare image quality between images, the FFT size has to be the same for all images!** \nThis number defines the relative positioning of the control slice that will be used to estimate unspecific high-frequency noise such as camera noise. This noise will be subtracted from the final result in each slice. This number should be large enough so that slices do not share biological meaningful structures so that everything that correlates at high frequencies in Fourier space can be assumed to be unspecific noise. Hence, this number will depend on your imaging settings, your PSF and the type of staining. Default is 10. \nVisualize result as image:\nIf activated, the plugin will additionally create a new image that displays the individual blocks colored by a grey value that corresponds to their respective FRC-QE score. You can overlay this image with the original input image for visual control of the result.  \nThis gives you an overview over the image quality across your 3D stack. The x-axis shows the z-position within the stack and the y-axis the corresponding value at that position. You can save this image under ```File > Save```. \n\n### 5.\tAutomating FRC-QE\n<a name=\"automating\">\n</a>\n \nThe FRC-QE is fully scriptable, so that you can run it on multiple images at once, e.g. to compare protocols or imaging parameters. An example macro for automated analysis of multiple images can be found [here](https://github.com/PreibischLab/FRC-QE/blob/master/FRC-QE_automated_macro.ijm). Example notebooks in R for processing the data are available [here](https://github.com/PreibischLab/FRC-QE/tree/master/analysis_scripts). \n\n* *(3) Banterle, Niccol\u00f2, Khanh Huy Bui, Edward A.
