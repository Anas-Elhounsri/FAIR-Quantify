Differentially expressed genes/proteins (i.e., DEG/DEP) from disease and\ndrug perturbed profiles are passed as input together with GWAS data. Once the data is correctly formatted, users can\ndefine a custom pipeline, or series of steps in the workflow that will then be applied to the datasets. The steps\nperformed in this pipeline constitute the optional portion of the workflow and involve filtering the *-omics* features\ncoming from the dataset in order to reduce dimensionality by exclusively analyzing genes that have been associated with\nGWAS studies. Next, a previously selected pathway enrichment method is applied to DEG/DEP datasets deriving from both\nthe disease and drug perturbed profiles to evaluate the direction of dysregulation for each affected pathway in each of\nthese contexts. Finally, the workflow prioritizes drugs by finding the drugs that are predicted to invert the pathway\nsignatures observed in the pathophysiology context.\n \n"
