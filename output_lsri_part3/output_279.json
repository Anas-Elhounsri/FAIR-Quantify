        "value": "\r\nIn spite of the discrete nature of read counts, MAnorm2 uses continuous\r\ndistribution to model ChIP-seq data by first transforming raw read counts into\r\nraw signal intensities. By default, MAnorm2 completes the transformation by\r\nsimply adding an offset count to each raw count and taking a base-2 logarithm.\r\nPractical ChIP-seq data sets, however, may be associated with various\r\nconfounding factors, including batch effects, local sequence compositions and\r\nbackground signals measured by input samples. On this account, functions in\r\nMAnorm2 have been designed to be independent of the specific transformation\r\nemployed. And any methods for correcting for confounding factors could be\r\napplied before invoking MAnorm2, as long as the resulting signal intensities\r\ncould be approximately modeled as following the normal distribution (in\r\nparticular, consider carefully whether it is necessary to apply a logarithmic\r\ntransformation in the final step).\r\n\r\nThe primary reason for which MAnorm2 models ChIP-seq signals as\r\ncontinuous random variables is that the mathematical theory of count\r\ndistributions is far less tractable than that of the normal distribution.\r\nFor example, current statistical methods based on the negative binomial\r\ndistribution are frequently relied on approximations of various kinds.\r\nSpecifically, variance (or dispersion) estimates for individual genomic\r\nintervals are typically treated as known parameters, and their uncertainty\r\ncan hardly be incorporated into the statistical tests for identifying\r\ndifferential signals.\r\n\r\nBesides, after an extensive correction for confounding factors,\r\nthe resulting data range is almost certainly not limited to non-negative\r\nintegers, and the data may have lost their discrete nature and be more akin\r\nto a continuous distribution. Moreover, transforming read counts towards the\r\nnormal distribution unlocks the application of a large repository of mature\r\nstatistical methods that are initially developed for analyzing continuous\r\nmeasurements (e.g., intensity data from microarray experiments). Refer to the\r\n[voom](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29)\r\narticle for a detailed discussion of this topic.\r\n\r\n\r \n"

Based on this assumption, MAnorm2 applies a linear\r\ntransformation to the raw signal intensities of one of the two samples such\r\nthat\r\n\r\n 1. the resulting M values (differences in signal intensities between the two\r\n    samples) at the common peak regions have an arithmetic mean of 0;\r\n 2.
