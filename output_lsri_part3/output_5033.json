This is a significance based approach that seeks to optimize a score derived from the strength of connection within multilayer communities. See the above reference for more details.\n- ```expectation.CM()```: estimate the expected edge weight between each pair of nodes across each layer of the multilayer network.\n- ```score()```: calculate the score of a specified vertex-layer community in an observed multilayer network.\n- ```plot.MultilayerCommunity()```: diagnostic plot that shows the number of communities and average score of communities from extracted communities against the overall overlap between each identified community.\n- ```refine()```: refine a ```MultilayerCommunity``` object identified by the ```multilayer.extraction()``` function so as to obtain a desired amount of overlap.\n"

        "value": "Here we show how to use multilayer.extraction in practice by demonstrating an example on the Austrailian Computer Science network. This data set is a multilayer network describing the relationships among attendees at an Austrailian computer science conference.  \nThere were 61 attendees (represented by the nodes in each layer), and 5 relationships that are represented by the layers in the network. The \ndata is provided in the file ```AU_CS.rda``` in a list format where each entry represents a different layer, and the type of relationship is represented by the name of the list entry.   \nBelow, we show how to load the data and run the Multilayer Extraction algorithm on the network.\n```\n#load the data\ndata(\"AU_CS\")\n\n#number of nodes and layers\nn <- dim(AU_CS[[1]])[1]\nm <- length(AU_CS)\n\n#types of relationships among attendees\nrelationship.names <- names(AU_CS)\nprint(relationship.names)\n```\nNext, we get a cursory view of some of the layers in the network. We follow this up by looking at the mean degree of the nodes in each of the layers.\n```\nimage(AU_CS$coauthor, main = \"Co-author\")\nimage(AU_CS$facebook, main = \"Leisure\")\nimage(AU_CS$leisure, main = \"Facebook\")\n\n\nMean.Degree <- sapply(AU_CS, mean) * n\nprint(Mean.Degree)\n```\n \nNotably, this network has heterogeneous connectivity as witnessed above. The Multilayer Extraction algorithm accounts for such heterogeneity and identifies communities using the joint information from the layers. \nWe now run the extraction algorithm.\n```\n##run Multilayer Extraction algorithm on this network\n\n##convert the list of adjacency matrices to an edgelist\nnetwork <- adjacency.to.edgelist(AU_CS)\nset.seed(123)\nstart_time <- Sys.time()\ncommunity.object <- multilayer.extraction(adjacency = network, seed = 123, min.score = 0, prop.sample = .10)\nend_time <- Sys.time()\n\nend_time - start_time\n#for me, this took 1.055319 mins\n\n#plot the number of communities across overlap parameter beta\nplot(community.object, main = \"Diagnostic Plot AU_CS\")\nobject <- refine(community.object, k = 6, m = m, n = n)\n\n##there are 7 small communities. Let's look at the size of each\nnum.layers <- colSums(object$Layers > 0)\nnum.vertices <- colSums(object$Vertices)\n\nprint(data.frame(Layers = num.layers, Vertices = num.vertices))\n``` \n"
