This is visible on the website, where the same sequence is found under multiple 'Feature' tabs. This means that the same sequence will also be grabbed multiple times when scraping data from GenBank, hence GB_data has 1240 observations when it was given 525 accession numbers to search.   \nIt should also be noted at this stage that `GB_data` only has data for 523 unique accession numbers, two less that the number included in the `vignette_accessions.csv`.  A key feature of the `build_genbank_df` function is that it will silently remove any RefSeq accessions included in the list of accession numbers it is given, if they are identified as duplicates.  The RefSeq collection aims to provide a collated and stable set of standard reference sequences for studies from all disciplines to build on.  Drawn from genomes already available in GenBank and other community databases, they may duplicate existing accessions and, for our purposes, need to be removed.  The `load_accessions_list` function, called within `build_genbank_df` silently removes these accessions having first checked that the 'original' accessions they duplicate are already included in the dataset.  \n"

Instead, the papers associated with the unique haplotypes are listed in a .csv file along with the species name; the file is is written out as \"More_info_df.csv\".  \nFor each of the populations recorded in \"More_info_df.csv\", the `align_and_summarise` function also creates a file containing each accession number and a frequency column.  These files all have the regular pattern \"MAGNIFY\"\" in the file name.  Original published papers must be tracked down to confirm details of sampling frequency, new values can then be recorded in the \"freq\" column.  Once updated the file needs to be saved in the same format. In cases where sampling frequency data is not available samples must be excluded. \n\nIn this vignette-dataset accessions for *Calidris maritima*, *Motacilla alba*, and *Carpodacus erythrinus* are flagged as needing further investigation. Exploration of the original published papers suggest that data for *Motacilla alba* and *Carpodacus erythrinus* have indeed been uploaded at sampled frequency and this was essentially a \"false alarm\". Therefore, we don't want to alter this data so the \"MAGNIFY_Motacilla_alba.csv\" file and \"MAGNIFY_Carpodacus_erythrinus.csv\" can be left as it is, with a default \"freq\" column value of \"1\". \nHowever, exploration of the paper *'A review of the subspecies status of the Icelandic Purple Sandpiper Calidris maritima littoralis'* shows that only unique haplotype sequences were uploaded, rather than a new accession being created for every sample.  Therefore, this dataset needs to be manipulated to get to the original sampled frequency.  \nFor the purposes of this vignette we have created an updated \"MAGNIFY_Calidris_maritima.csv\" file (found in ../extdata/) which already contains the values for the number of times each haplotype was sampled in the population. The below code simply copies this file to the temporary working directory currently in use.\n```r\ninvisible(file.copy(from = paste0(system.file(\"extdata\", package=\"mtDNAcombine\"),\n                        \"/MAGNIFY_Calidris_maritima.csv\"), \n          to = paste0(getwd(), \"/\")))\n```\nThis file is now ready to be used with the `magnify_to_sampled_freq` function, as below.\n```r\nmagnify_file_list <- list.files(pattern=\"MAGNIFY\")\n\nmag_df <- magnify_to_sampled_freq(magnify_file_list = magnify_file_list)\n```\n \nAfter updating the frequency information the sequences are processed as before - haplotype networks are drawn and .fasta files of the aligned sequence data written out. \n\nTo keep accurate summary information of the datasets available, we now need to combine the original `info_df` and the newly created `mag_df`.  This will give an updated .csv file that contains information on all the data sets we are working with.\n```r\ninfo_df <- updating_info_df(original_df = \"Info_df.csv\", new_df = mag_df)\n```\n \n"

This is due to older versions of these packages being removed from CRAN after the R v4.0 release. Once installed using the code below, you should be able to install `mtDNAcombine` as normal.\n```r\ninstall.packages(c(\"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mnormt/mnormt_1.5-6.tar.gz\"), \n                 repos=NULL,type=\"source\")\n\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(\"Biostrings\")\n```\n \n"
