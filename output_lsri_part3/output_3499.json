        "value": "In what follows we provide an example for how these scripts were used to \ndetermine the structure of DNA fragment ends, the length of gaps in the \ninterior of DNA fragments and the base composition and substitution frequencies \naround fragment ends and gaps in the Vindija 33.19 Neandertal. The scripts and \nBAM files have to be located in the working directory or their path specified. \n\nWe start with a BAM file (`vindija33.19.bam`, provided as part of the \ndocumentation) with sorted sequence alignments to the human reference genome \n(hg19). Sequences were pre-processed by adapter trimming and overlap-merging of \npaired reads (using [leeHom](https://grenaud.github.io/leeHom/)), removal of \nduplicates (using [`bam-rmdup`](https://github.com/mpieva/biohazard-tools))\nand removal of residual paired reads and sequences < 35 bp or with a map \nquality score < 25 (using `samtools view`).\n\n1. Identification of overlapping sequence alignments on complementary strands \n   (putatively representing double-stranded DNA fragments)\n\n    The `complementary_strands2.pl` script is executed as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./complementary_strands2.pl -output 2 vindija33.19.bam\n    ```\n\n    This script generates several output files, the most relevant of which are:\n\n    * `vindija33.19.comp_strands.hist.txt` => tab-delimited table containing \n      histograms of the distances between all 5' ends and the closest 3' end on \n      the complementary strand (and vice versa).\n\n    * `vindija33.19.5p-blunt.bam` => BAM file containing sequences where the 5' \n      end was inferred to be located in a blunt-end\n\n    * `vindija33.19.5p-overhang-1bp.bam` => BAM file containing sequences where \n      the 5' end was inferred to be located in a 5' overhang\n\n    Additional BAM files are generated for longer 5' overhangs, 5' recessed \n    ends and sequences representing overhanging, blunt and recessed 3' ends.\n\n2. Identification of strands mapping in close proximity to the reference \n   genome, in same strand orientation (putatively representing gaps in \n   double-stranded DNA fragments)\n\n    Execute the `alignment_distance.pl` script as follows:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./alignment_distance.pl -output 2 vindija33.19.bam >vindija33.19.gaps.txt\n    ```\n\n    This generates the following files:\n\n    * `vindija33.19.gaps.txt` => tab delimited file containing a histogram of the \n      shortest distances between the 3' and 5' ends of DNA strands mapped to \n      the reference genome in the same orientation\n\n    * `vindija33.19.1st_dist2.bam` => BAM file containing sequences with 3' ends \n      located 2 bp upstream of the 5' end of another sequence mapped to the \n      same strand (i.e. sequences preceding a 1 bp gap)\n\n    * `vindija33.19.1st_dist2.bam` => BAM file containing sequences with 5' ends \n      located located 2 bp downstream of the 3' end of another sequence mapped \n      to the same strand (i.e. sequences preceded by a 1 bp gap)\n\n3. Evaluating the position-dependent base composition and substitution \n   frequencies in DNA strands assigned to various structural contexts.\n\n    Execute the `substitution_frequencies2.pl` script as follows, using the BAM \n    files produced with the previous scripts as input. The reference genome \n    (hg19) has to be provided in fasta format.\n\n    ```bash\n    ./substitution_patterns2.pl -graphical -reference hg19_whole_genome.fa *.bam\n    ```\n\n    For each BAM file, a PDF file is created containing plots of the base \n    composition and frequencies of all possible substitutions around alignment \n    start and end points. The data underlying these plots are also provided in \n    tab-delimited text format.\n\n---\n\n*Matthias Meyer*  \n*15 May 2020*\n\n"
