For the avoidance of doubt, no licenses to use the Work for commercial or for-profit purposes are granted hereunder.  If You institute patent litigation against any individual or entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work or such Contribution shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.  If Licensor determines in its sole discretion that You have exceeded the scope or otherwise breached the terms of the License granted herein, it shall have the right to terminate the License in addition to all other remedies available to it under common law, by statute, and in equity.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n      (a) The reproduction and distribution is only for academic or other non-commercial research purposes;\n      (b) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License;\n      (c) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and include in a NOTICE text file a description of Your changes; \n      (d) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Work that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, except for notices that do not pertain to any portion of the Derivative Work;\n      (e) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Work that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, except for notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Work, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Work; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Work; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Work, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed          as modifying the License.  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with all the terms and conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.  Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate agreement you may have executed or may execute with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor.    Pursuant to nominative fair use principles, you may merely identify Licensor as the original author of the Work.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND.  LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHER (INCLUDING ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE), AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE WORK, OR ANY OTHER LICENSOR OR THIRD-PARTY GOODS, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGIES OR MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE), OR ANY PRODUCTS OR RESULTS OF THE USE OF ANY OF THEM, WILL MEET YOUR OR ANY OTHER PERSONS' REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY OTHER GOODS, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGIES OR MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, SYSTEM OR NETWORK), OR BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE OR ERROR FREE. ALL OPEN-SOURCE COMPONENTS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF OR CONCERNING ANY OF THEM IS STRICTLY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD-PARTY OWNER OR DISTRIBUTOR OF SUCH OPEN-SOURCE COMPONENTS AND THIRD-PARTY MATERIALS.
