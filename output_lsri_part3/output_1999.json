It then uses a regression model to classify samples in the latent space with good accuracy using a simple line. It then finds the furthest points to that line on both sides. We call these *extreme samples*. \n3. It then randomly generates new samples around the extreme samples using a normal distribution, called Extreme Pseudo-Samples. Using the same trained VAE, these newly generated samples are mapped back into the feature space. \n4. A new regression model is trained to classify the generated Pseudo-Samples. We then use the regression line to rank the most important features in these Extreme Pseudo-Samples. \n \n"

They should be normalized, thus the default value for this option is set to true. If the data is already normalized, a false flag can be passed.\n- *vae_address* sets to address that EPS uses to save the VAE model. EPS has to retrieve the model later to use the decoder, or to train regressors for other case/control groups (*default=./vae_mode.ckpt*).\n- *layers* is an integer python list containing the number of perceptrons in every layer of your Deep Variational Auto-Encoder; only in the encoder side; the decoder side will be mirrored (*default=None*; The default value should only be used if the the layers have been setup using `set_layers` prior to training).\n\n   For example if you want to have a Deep Network with the following structure:\n`Input -> 250 -> 120 -> 60 -> Latent Space with 30 dimensions -> 60 -> 120 -> 250 -> Output`, you can represent it by passing the following as your layers argument: `layers = [250,120,60,30]`\n\nThe `train` function returns the EPS instance object.\n\nAfter training the VAE, you can generate extreme pseudo-samples by calling the `generate` function:\n\n`eps.generate(count, regression_epochs, learning_rate, regression_index, variance)`\n\n- *count* parameter sets the number of extreme pseudo-samples generated (*default=200*).\n- *regression_epochs* sets the number of epochs for the logistic regression training (*default=500*).\n- *learning_rate* sets the learning rate parameter for the Adam optimizer that fits the logitstic regression model (*default=1e-4*).\n- If you only want to use a subset of the data to train the regressor model, you can pass the list of indices as a numpy array  in *regression_index* parameter. This is useful for adopting multiple case/control study data to train a VAE and performing the rest of the feature selection steps separately for each dataset.\n- The *variance* parameter is used in the process of generating new extreme pseudo-samples around the real extreme samples (*default=0.2*).\n\nThe `generate` function returns the extreme pseudo-samples and their labels.\n\nAfter calling the generate function, the EPS object would also have the feature rankings. The `rank` function returns these rankings as a list of sorted indices based on the original order of features.\n\n`eps.rank()`\n"
