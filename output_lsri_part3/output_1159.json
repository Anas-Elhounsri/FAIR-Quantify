        "value": "The R package utilizes MSConvert ([ProteoWizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/)), [xcms](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html), [CAMERA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html), [MetMSLine](https://github.com/WMBEdmands/MetMSLine), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and many other packages to attempt to implement real-time **sim**ultaneous metabolomic MS1-profiling **Ex**periment and statistically relevant MS2 **Targ**et **Id**entification. \nA major impetus for development of this package was to provide an email-based early warning system for LC-MS instrumental stoppages/errors but also for more subtle changes such as instrument drift and (PCA-based) outlying pooled quality control samples for example. When collecting a dataset of precious/limited samples such as those with a low volume/quantity provided (e.g. mouse sera, dried blood spot punches) it can be particularly poignant if un-noticed instrumental stoppages leads to degradation of your samples or unwanted variation/batch effects.\nInstrumental drifts and potentially MS2 targets can be identified in real time using the two shiny apps developed for *simExTargId* `peakMonitor` and `targetId`. \nNarrowing the temporal gap to truly \"online\" target feature MS2 fragmentation is also a primary goal of *simExTargId*.  \nAll peak-picking, retention time alignment and grouping is performed by [xcms](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html), then ESI adducts and isotopes are detected by [CAMERA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html) in real time. Following this pre-processing of the peak-table is performed by [MetMSLine](https://github.com/WMBEdmands/MetMSLine). Automatic PCA-based outlier detection is performed and a warning email sent to user(s) if a QC sample is outlying. Furthermore, automatic real-time univariate co-variate based statistical analysis is then performed.  \n![example_PCA_Scores_Iteration_1+2](https://github.com/WMBEdmands/simExTargId/blob/master/inst/extdata/pcaOutId_scores_iter1_2.png)\n**Example PCA scores iterations 1 and 2** - averaged pooled Quality Control samples should cluster tightly near the origins of the first and second principal components \n******\nThe *simExTargId* workflow can be left running during the MS1-profiling data collection providing a degree of reassurance that serious instrumental difficulties will not go unnoticed (even whilst present in the laboratory and otherwise distracted) and also outlying samples and statistically relevant LC-MS feature targets can be identified and additional experiments/reinjections appended to the experimental worklist before the end.\n****** \n**Example signal attenuation warning email** - pooled quality controls can be used to monitor a database (.csv) of previously identified metabolites if a maximum percentage (>20%) of the monitored metabolites are greater than 20% attenuated (these defaults can be altered by user) then a warning email is sent. The output of the `peakMonitor` function can be visualized in a shiny application. \n******\n*SimExTargId* also attempts to inculcate a rigorous (and broadly accepted) experimental design and also a directory sub-structure for each experiment to help organize data and files for the user. Sub-directories, tables and plots are then generated in real time. For example, each time a new iteration of *simExTargId* takes place updated PCA plots and tables will appear in each sub-directory. The idea is to preserve the reproducibility by the recording of parameters used (and session information) and providing an easy to navigate and intuitive sub-directory structure.\n****** \n**Example sub-directory structure generated by simExTargId upon initiation** - the \"data\" directory should contain files which should not be modified such as the worklist/co-variates table received from the collaborators or the worklist file for example, the \"doc\" directory should contain all documentation i.e. manuscript files and method details, the \"output\" directory contains all output generated by *simExTargId* or by R code created after data collection, the \"R\" directory is used for all R code and workspace (.RData/.RDS) files. All mzXML files are saved in a separate directory due to their large size and to keep the size of analysis directory as small as possible.\n******\nA technical note describing the *simExTargId* package has been pre-published on the site BioRxiv:\n**simExTargId: An R package for real-time LC-MS metabolomic data analysis, instrument failure/drift notification and MS2 target identification**\nWilliam M.
