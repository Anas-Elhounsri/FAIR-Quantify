Change into anfisa directory, e.g.:\n```sh\n       cd anfisa\n```\n3. Checkout to `stable` release (for ex this is latest release in `github`)\n```sh\n       git checkout v.0.7.8\n```\n4. Decide what directory will be a working directory for Anfisa\n\n5. Decide which of the following installation paths you prefer:\n- Use a Docker container. This method will also install Druid and \nother dependencies. However, Druid requires at least 8G of memory, \nif your box does not have this amount of RAM, you should avoid running \nDruid or adjust its settings. Druid can also be run on a separate box. \n- Install all components in your local system. This is only recommended \nif you will contributing to Anfisa development or customizing its code. \n\n***"
