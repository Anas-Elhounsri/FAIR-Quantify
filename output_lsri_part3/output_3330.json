        "value": "> DECoNT is a deep learning based software that corrects CNV predictions on exome sequencing data using read depth sequences. \nTo reproduce results given in the manuscript, <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.09.086082v1\" target=\"_blank\">**Polishing Copy Number Variant Calls on Exome Sequencing Data via Deep Learning**</a>, please refer to https://zenodo.org/record/3865380#.XtVRchMzZds. This repository also includes the toy example tutorial. \n\n## Table of Contents  \n> Warning: Please note that DECoNT software is completely free for academic usage. However it is licenced for commercial usage. Please first refer to the [License](#license) section for more info. \n## Features \n#### -m, --model\n- For version 0.1, DECoNT provides pretrained weights for polishing CNV calls from the following WES-based CNV callers: (i) XHMM; (ii) CoNIFER; (iii) CODEX2; (iv) Control-FREEC.\n- If you want to use pretrained DECoNT weights for polishing set this argument to <b>pretrained</b>.\n- If you want to use custom model weights for DECoNT obtained using DECoNT_train.py script, please provide path to model weights with <b>.h5</b> extension instead.  \n#### -cn, --callername\n- For version 0.1, DECoNT supports only XHMM, CoNIFER, CODEX2 and Control-FREEC. For future versions, DECoNT will be able to polish any CNV output format with a required CNV output template.\n- Set to one of the WES-based CNV caller names above for DECoNT to understand the required weights for the polishing process.  \n#### -g, --gpu\n- Set to PCI BUS ID of the gpu in your system.\n- You can check, PCI BUS IDs of the gpus in your system with various ways. Using gpustat tool check IDs of the gpus in your system like below:\n```shell\n$ gpustat\n``` \n<img src=\"./gpustatexample.png\"   class=\"center\">\n \n#### -v, --version\n-Check the version of DECoNT. \n> Usage of DECoNT is very simple, also it comes with ETA and progress bar features! \n### Step-1: Use your preferred WES-based CNV caller to call CNVs on your WES dataset. \n- For XHMM refer to: <a href=\"https://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xhmm/tutorial.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">**XHMM Manual Page**</a>\n- For CoNIFER refer to: <a href=\"http://conifer.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\">**CoNIFER Manual Page**</a>\n- For CODEX2 refer to: <a href=\"http://conifer.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html\" target=\"_blank\">**CODEX2 Manual Page**</a>\n- For Control-FREEC refer to: <a href=\"http://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/FREEC/tutorial.html\">**Control-FREEC Manual Page**</a>\n- After obtaining output file from one of these tools, store it.\n- For purposes of this tutorial, lets call the output WES CNV file:  /home/user/analysis.txt \n### Step-2: Obtain read depth files for samples used in WES CNV calling. \n- Read depth counts obtained using <a href=\"https://lomereiter.github.io/sambamba/\" target=\"_blank\">**Sambamba**</a> tool are directly accepted by DECoNT. Note that you should use -w option of sambamba with parameter 1000. By doing so, sambamba sets base-pair resolution to 1000bp. You can run sambamba on your inputs as follows:\n```shell\n$ sambamba depth window -w 1000 HG00096.wes.bam > /home/user/sambamba_read_depths/HG00096.wes.bam_read_depths.txt\n``` \n- Note that, all read depth files must have SAMPLENAME. prefix in the file name.\n- You can use any read depth generator you like, however for DECoNT to have unified input format, we require the following format for read depth files:\n \n-Note that, DECoNT does not use mean coverage information column provided in the above file format figure. You can fill that column with all 0's.\n- For purposes of this tutorial, lets call the directory containing all described read depth files: /home/user/sambamba_read_depths/ \n### Step-3: Run DECoNT on data obtained in Step-1 and Step-2 \n- Requirements of DECoNT must be satisfied. For easy handling of requirements download DECoNT_mac.yml or DECoNT_linux.yml file and initialize environment of DECoNT as follows (optional).\n```shell\n$ conda env create -f DECoNT_mac.yml\n$ conda activate DECoNT_mac\n```\n- Note: for the scope of this tutorial, we assume that WES CNV calls are obtained using XHMM software. If you obtain WES CNV calls using any other software just change the -cn argument to that software.\n- After initializing the envorinment, run decont as follows:\n```shell\n$ python ./DECoNT_polish.py -m pretrained -cn XHMM -i /home/user/analysis.txt -o /home/user/ -s /home/user/sambamba_read_depths/\n```\n- Optionally, if you have available gpu's, you can set -g argument to PCI BUS ID of the GPU you want to use. Please refer to Optional Arguments section. By default, script will use CPU.\n \n### Output file of DECoNT\n- At the end of the polishing procedure, DECoNT will write its output file to the directory given with -o option. In this tutorial it is /home/user/\n- Output file of DECoNT is a tab-delimited .bed like format. \n- Columns in the output file of DECoNT are the following with order: 1. Sample Name, 2. Chromosome, 3. CNV Start Index, 4. CNV End Index, 5. XHMM Prediction (XHMM name changes according to the -cn argument), 6. DECoNT Polished Prediction\n- Following figure is an example of DECoNT output file. \nJust follow the steps above, instead of analysis.txt use DATA_chaisson_hg00733.xcnv file provided. Also instead of /sambamba_read_depths/ directory use the directory in this <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UqXs3rB3XcVRq5GB-zcJsyDW086igaS4\">**link**</a> and repeat the steps. \n"
