Every contribution is meaningful, whether you catch bugs, make performance improvements, and help with documentation. We appreciate your time and effort to make open-science great!\n\nWhen contributing to our project, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email *info@useetoo.org*, or any other method with the maintainers of this repository before making a change. The following lines are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\n\nPlease follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when making a contribution.\n\n## Contributing for the first time\nIt's always hard the first time you do something. Everything new is scary. But we'd like to encourage you to join our project because every contribution, huge or tiny, helps us to improve. You don't even have to learn CAD designing or programming, there are other ways of contributing.\n\nWhere to start? Have a look at our [TUTORIALS](./TUTORIALS), especially at the [First steps with GitHub](./TUTORIALS#github). There you find links to guidelines tp GitHub contributions for beginners.\n\n## How can I contribute? :muscle:\nThings in need of attention are currently described in issues so have a look there if you'd like to work on something but aren't sure what.\n\n### Become a UC2 builder :construction_worker:\n* The UC2 toolbox or its parts could be useful in your work? Give it a try!\n* Share your results - setups you've built or things you've seen with them - on Twitter using [#openUc2](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openUc2&src=typed_query)\n* Fork it, and make pull requests - documentation improvements are every bit as useful as a new design or software improvement\n* Propose adding your results to the APP's README in a pull request - [Issue #27](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT/issues/27)\n  * Include: the image of the setup you've build, an image of what you've seen with it, your name and institution (if relevant)\n* You've built your setup following the [TUTORIALS](./TUTORIALS)? Suggest an improvement there - [Issue #26](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT/issues/26)\n\n### Documentation :pencil:\n* Get involved in discussions in the [ISSUE-section](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT/issues).\n* Raise an issue if you spot something that's wrong, or something that could be improved. This includes the instructions/documentation.\n  * Improve assembly tutorial if you found out there's an important of anyhow useful information missing\n  * Create alignment tutorial with images of a setup that you've built and doesn't have a detailed tutorial yet\n  * Suggest better text or images for the instructions\n\n### Hardware :hammer:\n* We support you with the basic CAD design files, so that you can develop specific hardware-function which can fit in our cubes.\n* We provide a brief tutorial on how to design an insert which adapts any part to the UC2 system. Please find it [here](./CAD/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base/#tutorial-on-how-to-design-an-insert-in-inventor) on how to design an insert in Inventor.\n* Improve the design of parts. STL files or descriptions of changes are helpful, even if you don't use OpenSCAD or Inventor.\n\n### Software :computer:\n* Our software-oriented [UC2-SOFTWARE-GIT](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT) provides you with all the different programs that you need to automate your blocks\n* Run our GUI on [RasPi](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/GUI/RASPBERRY_PI/RASPIapp_py3) or [Android-Phone](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/GUI/Android/UC2-TheBox)\n  * Report bugs or other issues\n* Setup your [Arduino](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/HARDWARE_CONTROL/ARDUINO) or [ESP32](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/HARDWARE_CONTROL/ESP32)\n* We want to generalize our Software to integrate even more with community standards and have an overall compatibility with different Operating Systems. Get **INVOLVED** by:\n  * switching to a new browser-based GUI\n  * improving our MQTT based connection routines and trying to improve the necessary hardware-flashes\n  * adding totally unknown functions\n  * making our Software as modular as possible\n"

Applicability\n\n\t2.1. This Licence governs the use, copying, modification,\n\tcommunication to the public and distribution of the Documentation, and\n\tthe manufacture and distribution of Products. By exercising any right\n\tgranted under this Licence, the Licensee irrevocably accepts these\n\tterms and conditions.\n\n\t2.2. This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to the Licensee,\n\tand shall apply worldwide and without limitation in time. The Licensee\n\tmay assign his licence rights or grant sub-licences.\n\n\t2.3. This Licence does not extend to software, firmware, or code\n\tloaded into programmable devices which may be used in conjunction with\n\tthe Documentation, the modified Documentation or with Products, unless\n\tsuch software, firmware, or code is explicitly expressed to be subject\n\tto this Licence. The use of such software, firmware, or code is\n\totherwise subject to the applicable licence terms and conditions.\n\n\t3. Copying, modification, communication to the public and distribution\n\tof the Documentation\n\n\t3.1. The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright and trademarks\n\tnotices, all notices referring to Documentation Location, and all\n\tnotices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties\n\tthat are included in the Documentation.

Manufacture and distribution of Products\n\n\t4.1. The Licensee may manufacture or distribute Products always\n\tprovided that, where such manufacture or distribution requires a\n\tlicence under this Licence the Licensee provides to each recipient of\n\tsuch Products an easy means of accessing a copy of the Documentation\n\tor modified Documentation, as applicable, as set out in section 3.\n\n\t4.2. The Licensee is invited to inform any Licensor who has indicated\n\this wish to receive this information about the type, quantity and\n\tdates of production of Products the Licensee has (had) manufactured\n\n\t5. Warranty and liability\n\n\t5.1. DISCLAIMER \u2013 The Documentation and any modified Documentation are\n\tprovided \"as is\" and any express or implied warranties, including, but\n\tnot limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory\n\tquality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a\n\tparticular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of the\n\tDocumentation, the modified Documentation or any Product. The Licensor\n\tmakes no representation that the Documentation, modified\n\tDocumentation, or any Product, does or will not infringe any patent,\n\tcopyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as\n\tto the use, quality, and performance of a Product shall be with the\n\tLicensee and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an\n\tessential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any\n\trights granted under this Licence. The Licensee warrants that it does\n\tnot act in a consumer capacity.\n\n\t5.2. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY \u2013 The Licensor shall have no liability\n\tfor direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,\n\tpunitive or other damages of any character including, without\n\tlimitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use,\n\tdata or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any\n\ttheory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product\n\tliability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the\n\tDocumentation, modified Documentation and/or the use, manufacture or\n\tdistribution of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such\n\tdamages, and the Licensee shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless\n\tfrom any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including\n\tclaims by third parties, in relation to such use.\n\n\t6. General\n\n\t6.1. Except for the rights explicitly granted hereunder, this Licence\n\tdoes not imply or represent any transfer or assignment of intellectual\n\tproperty rights to the Licensee.\n\n\t6.2. The Licensee shall not use or make reference to any of the names\n\t(including acronyms and abbreviations), images, or logos under which\n\tthe Licensor is known, save in so far as required to comply with\n\tsection 3.

CERN may publish updated versions of this Licence which retain\n\tthe same general provisions as this version, but differ in detail so\n\tfar this is required and reasonable. New versions will be published\n\twith a unique version number.\n\n\t6.4. This License shall terminate with immediate effect, upon written\n\tnotice and without involvement of a court if the Licensee fails to\n\tcomply with any of its terms and conditions, or if the Licensee\n\tinitiates legal action against Licensor in relation to this\n\tLicence.

        "value": "**WARNING THIS SIDE IS UNDER REVISION! MANY CHANGES AHEAD!**\n\n\n**UC2** is a general-purpose modular framework for making interactive (electro)-optical projects. Most optical systems such as microscopes follow a simple **4f** or Fourier-optical principle, where lenses are aligned such that focal-planes of adjacent components overlap to limit the amount of aberrations as much as possible and to be able to predict the system-behavior easily using Fourier-transforms.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"./IMAGES/YoutubeSeminar.png\" height=\"300\">\n<br> A recent seminar explaining the core concept of UC2 and their recent advances <br>\n<p>\n\n\nFollowing this idea, a microscope as shown in **Fig 1** creates an angular magnification depending on the focal lenghts of the objective f<sub>obj</sub> and tube lens f<sub>tube</sub>:\n\n***M<sub>4f</sub>=  f<sub>tube</sub>/f<sub>obj</sub>***\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"./IMAGES/UC2_simplemicroscope.png\" width=\"800\">\n<br> Fig. 1: Fourier-Optical Setup; Koehler Illumination where the illumination plane is conjugate to the objective pupil plane (BFP)\n</p>\n\nBesides optical components, the **UC2** building blocks can also host electronics such as **Arduinos** or **ESP32s** to create ''smart'' functions like LED array illumination, Z-stages, et cetera. Communication can be granted through the wired **USB Serial** BUS or the wireless **REST-API**. For this the dedicated [**UC2-REST**](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-REST/blob/master/README.md) will help you setting everything up.\n\n**UC2** is in active development. It is meant to be used not only by beginners, but also for professionals dealing with optical setups on a daily basis. Its magnetic click-and-go concept simplifies the process of aligning and adjusting the parts giving new tools acting as rapid-prototyping devices. It also comes with a series of open-source workshops (in the future) explaining the theory behind optics.\n\nPeople are also encouraged to share their work. We are curious what the community is doing with our little blocks. All necessary details to modify the design of the blocks are given in the sub-folders of the specific folders. Share your ideas through our [@openUC2-Twitter account](https://twitter.com/openuc2).\n\nWith the version *UC2_v3* we introduced an **injection moulded (IM) cube**. This makes the assembly easier becuase no screws or magnets are needed for the Base Cube. But there is also a **3D-printed (3DP) cube** that is alternative to the IM one an it is fully compatible - the cubes and baseplates can be arbitrarily combined.   \nFind out more about the two different Cube designs in [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](./CAD/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base) and more about the baseplate puzzles in [ASSEMBLY_Baseplate](./CAD/ASSEMBLY_Baseplate).\n\n*We are working on making the IM Cubes and Puzzles available for sale, but we are not able to offer a 'BUY' button yet. If you are interested in buying some components, contact us via email info@useetoo.org*\n\nA full cube + base-plate looks like that:\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"./IMAGES/Assembly_Cube_IM_explosion.png\" height=\"300\">\n<img src=\"./IMAGES/Assembly_Cube_3DP_explosion.png\" height=\"300\">\n<br> Fig. 2: Assembly of the cube + base-plate; <br>\nLEFT: IM Cube - Two identical halves of the Cube are pressed together, the Cube connects to the baseplate via lego-like pins; <br>\nRIGHT: 3DP Cube - A set of ferro-magnetic screws hold the lid and base-cube in place and connect to four 5mm Neodym ballmagnets sitting in the baseplate, and extra set of M5 screws further fixes the cube to the baseplate and supports the alignment; Optical components find their place inside the cube.\n</p>\n\n:grey_exclamation: If you are still working with the v2 version of the cube, you find the documentation in the [UC2_v2 branch](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT/tree/UC2_v2). Check out the Modular Developer Kit to learn about the [UC2 version history](./MDK#uc2-version-history).\n\n**UC2** can be used with cameras from the Raspberry Pi world, but creates even more beautiful images with your cellphone. Thus making cutting edge-research not only affordable, but also available.\nA more in-detail project description can be found in the [UC2 White-Paper](./TUTORIALS/DOCUMENTS/UC2_Whitepaper.pdf)\n\n## UC2 as an \"open-standard\"\n\nThe idea is to use **UC2** as an open-standard or bridge to external hardware components and devices such as cameras or lenses. An already existing or customized adapter/insert creates the link to the **UC2** eco-system. A variety of ready-to-use adapters can be found in the folder [CAD](./CAD).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"./IMAGES/MDK.jpg\" width=\"550\">\n<br> Fig. 3: The structure of any UC2 assembly follows the green lines; A basic cube can hold an insert thus adapting to different components (i.e. lenses, etc.); A number of assembled cube-modules can form a complex optical system here called application\n</p>\n\nA more in-detail description of the **MDK** (**M**odular **D**eveloper **K**it) which explains how ***your idea*** can be adapted to the module system can be found in the [MDK](./MDK)-folder. There you also found an explanation about the UC2 version history, if you found some confusing information through the repository.\n\nIf you have a new part, we are eager to see it.
