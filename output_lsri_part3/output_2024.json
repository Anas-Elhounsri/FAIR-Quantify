Each row contains the expression levels of each of the *G* genes.\n\nThe `/atlas` subfolder includes several `.mat` files which contain the matrices used for each of the three biological systems under study: the zebrafish embryo ([Satija et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3192)), the Drosophila embryo ([Karaiskos et al., 2017](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/358/6360/194)), and the murine hair follicle ([Joost et al., 2016](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S2405-4712(16)30265-4)). To load the data, simply navigate to the `/atlas` subfolder in the MATLAB \"Current Folder\" selector and double click to load each `.mat` file. Alternatively, run the following from the MATLAB Command Window:\n\n```\nload('/atlas/SYSTEM.mat')\n```\nwhere `SYSTEM` is replaced by either `Follicle`, `Drosophila`, `Zebrafish`, or `MouseCortex2`. For each system, several atlases are imported, including a binary and a continuous version, clearly labelled, e.g. `Atlas_ZebrafishBinary`.\n"

The output `acc` is the accuracy, `prec` is the precision, `rob` is the robustness, and `perf` is the overall performance score.

        "value": "To quantify the performance of a given method on actual scRNA-seq data where the origin is unknown, we also define a quantity called the predictive reproducibility, determined from a k-fold cross validation scheme where we split the genes into k different folds, then map the cells using all but one fold. We then use the heatmap of correspondence scores for each method to reconstruct the expression of each gene in the dropped out fold in both the atlas (using the scRNA-seq data) and the scRNA-seq data (using the atlas). To accommodate the sparsity of data, we calculate the predictive reproducibility separately for cells or positions with zero expression and for those with nonzero expression. This results in four values, giving a comprehensive measure of the predictive power of a given method. To generate the predictive reproducibility, we use the `CalculatePredictiveReproducibility()` function. For example, to determine the predictive reproducibility of DistMap using 5-fold cross validation, call\n```\n[pred_rep, array_SCD, array_Atlas, rec_SCD, rec_Atlas] = CalculatePredictiveReproducibility('distmap',MyAtlas,SCD,'numFolds',5)\n```\nwhere the second and third outputs are a 2xC and 2xP array of the cell-by-cell and position-by-position predictive reproducibility, and the fourth and fifth outputs are the reconstructed scRNA-seq data and atlas produced by the k-fold CV. \nNote that to determine the predictive reproducibility of a DEEPsc network, additional training is required since the mapping with only a subset of genes cannot be done with the original network. Indeed for k-fold CV, k separate networks must be trained. To train a group of DEEPsc networks to determine predictive reproducibility, use\n```\n[nets, indices] = TrainDEEPscPredRep(MyAtlas,'numFolds',k)\n```\nthen calculate predictive reproducibility by setting the `NNs` property to `nets` and `foldIndices` to `indices`. \nThe LMNN baseline also requires training separate metrics for each of the reduced spaces, which can be achieved with the `/utils/lmnn/TrainLMNNPredRep()` function. \n"
