        "value": "In the data analysis of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),\nlinear model frameworks, especially the mass univariate analysis (MUA),\nare often performed when researchers consider examining the difference\nbetween conditions at each sampled time point. \nHowever, some statistical issues, such as assumptions of linearity,\nauto-correlation and multiple comparison problems, influence the\nstatistical inferences when using the MUA on fNIRS time course data. \nTherefore, we proposed a novel perspective, **Multi-Time Points Analysis\n(MTPA)**, to discriminate signal differences between conditions by\ncombining temporal information from multiple time points in fNIRS. \nThe MTPA adopted the random forest algorithm from statistical learning\ndomain, followed by a series of cross validation procedures, providing\nreasonable power for detecting significant time points and ensuring the\ngeneralizability. \nUsing an real fNIRS dataset, the proposed MTPA would outperform the MUA.\nAs we seen in the following figure, the MUA with either false discovery\nrate correction or bonferroni correction could not detect any\nsignificant time points. Even we applied two non-parametric permutation\nframeworks, including the maximum *t*-statistics and the 1-D temporal\nclustering methods, the MUA still could not show any finding. In\ncontrast, the proposed MTPA can successfully detect more time points\nshowing significant differences between experimental conditions. \nFurthermore, the MTPA could also easily make a comparison between\ndifferent areas, leading to a novel viewpoint of fNIRS time course\nanalysis and providing additional theoretical implications in future\nfNIRS studies. \nThe present repository contains (1) an real fNIRS dataset as an example,\n(2) the code that demonstrated how to use MTPA in the basic `R`\nenvironment, (3) the code of doing the MUA for comparison, and (4) the\ncode to generate figures. \n"
