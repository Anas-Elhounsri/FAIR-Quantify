Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a \n   build.\n2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment \n   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\n3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this\n   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).\n4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you \n   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.\n\n## Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.\n\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new\nfeatures, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the\nchances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\n* **Overview of the issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\n* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you\n* **driftage Version(s)** - is it a regression?\n* **Dependencies type and version in use** - is this a problem with RabbitMQ 3.7.7 only?\n* **Reproduce the error** - provide a live example, screenshot, and/or a unambiguous set of steps. The more the better.\n* **Related issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?  Reference the related issues in the description.\n* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit).  If you're requesting a feature, describe how the feature might work to resolve the user story.\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request\nBefore you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:\n\n* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/dmvieira/driftage/pulls) for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n* Make your changes in a new git branch\n\n     ```shell\n     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\n     ```\n\n* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.\n* Follow our [Code Style](https://www.pylint.org/) with Flake8 and [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).\n* Run lint.\n\n    ```\n    make lint\n    ```\n* Run the full test suite, including `make test`,\n  and ensure that all tests pass.\n* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message\n\n     ```shell\n     git commit -a\n     ```\n  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\n* Build your changes locally to ensure all the tests and security checks pass\n\n    ```shell\n    make all-tests\n    ```\n\n* Push your branch to GitHub:\n\n    ```shell\n    git push origin my-fix-branch\n    ```\n\n* In GitHub, send a pull request to `master`.\n* If we suggest changes then:\n  * Make the required updates.\n  * Re-run the test suite to ensure tests are still passing.\n  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\n\n    ```shell\n    git rebase master -i\n    git push -f\n    ```\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\n\n### After your pull request is merged\n\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\n* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:\n\n    ```shell\n    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch\n    ```\n\n* Check out the master branch:\n\n    ```shell\n    git checkout master -f\n    ```\n\n* Delete the local branch:\n\n    ```shell\n    git branch -D my-fix-branch\n    ```\n\n## Reviewing Pull Requests\n\nExcept for critical, urgent or very small fixes, we try to leave pull requests open for most of the day or overnight if something comes in late in the day, so that multiple people have the chance to review/comment.  Anyone who reviews a pull request should leave a note to let others know that someone has looked at it.  For larger commits, we like to have a +1 from someone else on the core team and/or from other contributor(s).  Please note if you reviewed the code or tested locally -- a +1 by itself will typically be interpreted as your thinking its a good idea, but not having reviewed in detail.\n"

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [2020] [Diogo Munaro Vieira]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n"
