        "description": "## Summary\r\nxPore v2.1 has some minor changes from the previous version, which include the following.\r\n- All k-mers containing \u2018N\u2019 will be discarded in both options i.e. with and without `--genome` in `xpore dataprep`.\r\n- New GFF option: to map the transcriptomic to genomic coordinates (when using `--genome` in `xpore dataprep`), xPore requires both FASTA for sequence information and either GTF or GFF for coordinate information. However, GTF is the recommended option. If GFF is the only file available, please note that the GFF file works with GENCODE or ENSEMBL FASTA files, but not UCSC FASTA files. We plan to remove the requirement of FASTA files in a future release.\r\n- In `xpore dataprep`, the option names have been changed as follows.\r\n  - `--gtf_path_or_url` to `--gtf_or_gff`\r\n  - `--transcript_fasta_paths_or_urls` to `--transcript_fasta`\r\n- The link to our `demo` dataset in zenodo was corrected. \r\n- The documentation was updated to include these changes.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* gtf option, fastdataprep, and dataprep intermediate file removal by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/48\r\n* Update README.md by @jonathangoeke in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/49\r\n* remove pyensembl requirement and solve Arabidopsis bug by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/57\r\n* Update README.md by @jonathangoeke in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/51\r\n* replace if statement with KeyError in g2t mapping, add post-processing option, and add xpore wrapper by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/58\r\n* Update README.md by @jonathangoeke in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/66\r\n* Update help.rst by @jonathangoeke in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/67\r\n* readGTF function was modified to adapt to non-ensembl GTF input by @obenno in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/87\r\n* add assert \"NNNNN\" for process_tx and solve bug with stringtie gtf by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/96\r\n* Fix quickstart doc by @hendrikweisser in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/103\r\n* Add GFF annotation option and change fasta and gtf input flags names by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/90\r\n* update readthedocs with --gtf_or_gff specifics by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/105\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @yuukiiwa made their first contribution in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/48\r\n* @jonathangoeke made their first contribution in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/49\r\n* @obenno made their first contribution in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/87\r\n* @hendrikweisser made their first contribution in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/103\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/compare/v0.5.6...v2.1",

Please use the --genome flag and provide the GTF file (`--gtf_path_or_url`) and transcriptome FASTA file (`--transcript_fasta_paths_or_urls`) if  you would like to work with genomic coordinates.\r\n    - The option `--summary` is no longer needed and was removed.\r\n    - xpore dataprep will no longer produce 'N' in k-mers.\r\n- The documentation was updated to include these changes.\r\nxPore is still compatible with dataprep files generated with xPore v1.0.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* gtf option, fastdataprep, and dataprep intermediate file removal by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/48\r\n* Update README.md by @jonathangoeke in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/49\r\n* remove pyensembl requirement and solve Arabidopsis bug by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/57\r\n* replace if statement with KeyError in g2t mapping, add post-processing option, and add xpore wrapper by @yuukiiwa in https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/pull/58\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/GoekeLab/xpore/compare/v0.5.6...v2.0",
