        "value": "*shallowHRD* is a R script that can be launched from the command line. It relies on a ratio file characterizing the normalized read counts of a shallow Whole Genome Sequencing (>0.3x) in sliding windows along the genome and its segmentation. It was developped on the output of [ControlFREEC](http://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/FREEC/tutorial.html) ([Boeva,V. et al., 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3268243/)) but is adapted to similar softwares. We recommand now to use [QDNAseq](https://github.com/ccagc/QDNAseq) with 50kb windows (see QDNAseq_script_chrX). A script is also provided for ControlFREEC output. Adaptation to other tools are however possible by matching the required input format (see sections \"run shallowHRD\" and \"Nota Bene\").\n\nSoftwares such as QDNAseq count reads in sliding windows, normalize read count and then segment the genomic profile. *shallowHRD*, based on a inferred CNA cut-off representing a one copy difference, will smooth the segmentation in a step wise manner, using first large segments, reintegrating small segments afterwards and then filtering small interstitial CNAs. The profile is optimised two times for a more robust output and the inferred CNA cut-off is each time based on simulations. The HR status is estimated based on the number of Large-scale Genomic Alterations (LGAs) i.e. intra-chromosome arm CNA breaks along the genome. \n\n**IMPORTANT : This GitHub contains the *first* version of *shallowHRD* (v1.13). Since its publication, the software has been under continuous developpement and the *shallowHRDv2* has been published in Oncogene on November 2023. It improves *shallowHRD* by (i) securing correct estimation of LGA by managing specific noise coming from FFPE samples and (ii) minimizing not conclusive diagnostics by resolving borderline cases. It has been validated against the PAOLA-1/ENGOT-OV25 phase-III trial. The version 2.0 is for now not available online.** \n"
