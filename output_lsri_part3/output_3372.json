The objective of the Degree-Day, establishment Risk, and Pest event mapping system (DDRP) is to predict phenology and climate suitability of invasive, biocontrol, and IPM species for the conterminous United States. DDRP is written entirely in the R statistical programming language (R Development Core Team 2019), making it flexible and extensible, and has a simple command-line interface that has already been adapted for online use. The platform can use a variety of gridded weather and climate data types for any historical (post-hoc), real-time, or future (downscaled GCM) time period. Model products include gridded (raster) and graphical outputs of number of completed generations, phenological/pest events, and climate suitability (i.e., establishment risk maps). The platform is described in a peer-reviewed paper in PLoS ONE (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244005)."

Our spatial modeling platform known as DDRP (Degree-Days,\nRisk, and Phenological event mapping) was designed to provide regularly\nupdated forecasts of the potential distribution (risk of establishment)\nand timing of seasonal activities (phenology) of pests [(Barker et\nal.\u00a02020)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244005).

We typically run DDRP using\ncurrent and forecast climate data for the conterminous U.S. to provide\nreal-time decision support for a species; however, the platform accepts\ndata for any time frame or region, such as data for past years or for\nother countries. Model products include maps of the predicted potential\ndistribution (climate-based risk of establishment), number of\ngenerations, and dates of phenological events.

Typically seven\ncohorts are specified but any number can be used. While cohorts offer\nthe ability to spread the population in a Gaussian or other\ndistribution, there is currently no distributed-delay function, meaning\nthat the spread does not increase over multiple generations.  \n3) Phenological event maps (PEMs, also known as pest event maps), which\ndepict estimated calendar dates of seasonal activities or population\nevents. PEM parameters are specified as degree-days within each of the\nfour (plus overwintering) stages. For example, DDRP can be parameterized\nto make first egg-hatch PEMs by setting a degree-day value near the\ncompletion of the egg stage, or at the beginning of the larval stage. If\nthe former is used, then a second PEM, say for mid-larval development,\ncould be parameterized using a value such as one-half of the degree-day\ntotal for larval development.  \n4) Climatic suitability maps, which show two levels of climatic\nsuitability (moderate and severe stress exclusions). These are intended\nto indicate risk likelihood of short vs.\u00a0long-term establishment but\ncould also indicate migration zones, and uncertainties such as in\nspecies parameterization, model structure, and in the sources of climate\ndata.\n \n"
