In summary, it will estimate the similarity and perform tensor regression using the similarity as the predictor tensor. The features will be selected by applying an elastic net constraint on the coefficient vectors, and any non-zero coefficients will correspond to the features selected. In addition to applying MOSCATO, code to simulate multi-omic, single-cell data is also provided.\n"

        "value": "To use MOSCATO, two data types and a univariate outcome are assumed for each subject. The data types may be supplied either by each subject containing it's own datasets or in the long format where the first column specifies the subject. Note that the data types must have their rows matched by the same cells (i.e., X and G must have the same number of rows where the rows correspond to cells).\n\nIf wanting to use simulated data, use the simSingleCellNetwork() function from the simSingleCellNetwork.R file. This will use Splatter simulations proposed by Zappia et al in 2017 with extensions using concepts from the proposal of DNSMI by Zhang et al in 2020. To perform the function, a series of inputs will be specified which correspond to Splatter inputs for single-cell data:\n\n- pi0: Probability of the expression being an outlier?\n- mu0: If the expression is an outlier, what is the location?\n- sigma0: If the expression is an outlier, what is the scale?\n- mu_L: Location for library size\n- sigma_L: Scale for library size\n- phi: Common dispersion\n- df0: BCV degrees of freedom\n- x0: Midpoint for determining if dropout (i.e., expression truncated to 0)\n- k_shape: Shape for determining if dropout\n- m_mean: Mean number of cells for a given subject\n\nThere are also parameters for specifying the network strength and size of the simulations, similarly as used in DNSMI:\n\n- alpha: Helps specify signal strength. A number between 0 and 1\n- Rsq: Helps specify signal strength. A number between 0 and 1\n- rind: Helps specify signal strength. A number between 0 and 1\n- N: Number of subjects\n- nx: Number of network features in X (i.e., related to features in G and to the outcome)\n- nxPrime: Number of features in X related to features within G but not the outcome\n- ns: Number of features in X related to the outcome but not any features in G\n- nxNoise: Number of features in X unrelated to G and the outcome\n- ng: Number of network features in G (i.e., related to features in X and to the outcome)\n- ngPrime: Number of features in G related to features within X but not the outcome\n- nh: Number of features in G related to the outcome but not any features in X\n- ngNoise: Number of features in G unrelated to X and the outcome\n- noiseSD: Standard deviation to use for noise features\n- noiseMean: Mean to use for the noise features\n\nOne other parameter outLoc_ may be specified as a folder to save the data if the subject-level data is wanting to be saved as separate files. Note that this will save files such as X_1.rda and G_1.rda for subject 1, X_2.rda and G_2.rda for subject 2, and so on.\n\nAn example is as follows to generate multi-omic single-cell data with a network containing subset of features. \n\nOPTION 1: Save all subject-level data in separate files\n\n```\n  source(\"supportingSimulationFunctions.R\")   \n  source(\"simSingleCellNetwork.R\")\n  \n  outputLocation <- \"OPTIONAL: Put output location here for subject files\"\n  \n  testSim <- simSingleCellNetwork(\n    #Splatter inputs\n    pi0=0.002, #Outlier Probability\n    mu0=5, #outlier location\n    sigma0=0.4, #Outlier scale\n    mu_L=12, #Library size location\n    sigma_L=0.2, #Library size scale\n    phi=0.1, #common dispersion\n    df0=7, #BCV DoF\n    x0=1, #dropout modpoint\n    k_shape=0.5, #Dropout shape\n    #Sample-level inputs\n    m_mean=500, #Mean number of cells per subject\n    #DNSMI Inputs\n    alpha=0.35, \n    Rsq=0.85,\n    N=50,\n    rind=0.85,\n    nx=15,\n    nxPrime=20,\n    ns=20,\n    nxNoise=1500,\n    ng=10,\n    ngPrime=15,\n    nh=15,\n    ngNoise=1400,\n    noiseSD=1,\n    noiseMean=0,\n    outLoc_=outputLocation\n  )\n```\n\nIf outLoc_ was specified, this will create files for each of the subjects for their data types, along with a Ysim.rda file for a vector of their continuous outcomes.\n\n\nOPTION 2: Stack the single-cell data:\n\n```\n  source(\"supportingSimulationFunctions.R\")  \n  source(\"simSingleCellNetwork.R\")\n  \n  testSim <- simSingleCellNetwork(\n    #Splatter inputs\n    pi0=0.002, #Outlier Probability\n    mu0=5, #outlier location\n    sigma0=0.4, #Outlier scale\n    mu_L=12, #Library size location\n    sigma_L=0.2, #Library size scale\n    phi=0.1, #common dispersion\n    df0=7, #BCV DoF\n    x0=1, #dropout modpoint\n    k_shape=0.5, #Dropout shape\n    #Sample-level inputs\n    m_mean=500, #Mean number of cells per subject\n    #DNSMI Inputs\n    alpha=0.35, \n    Rsq=0.85,\n    N=50,\n    rind=0.85,\n    nx=15,\n    nxPrime=20,\n    ns=20,\n    nxNoise=1500,\n    ng=10,\n    ngPrime=15,\n    nh=15,\n    ngNoise=1400,\n    noiseSD=1,\n    noiseMean=0\n  )\n```\n\nThis returns objects X (stacked data type 1), G (stacked data type 2), subjectIDs (vector specifying which rows correspond to which subjects), and y (vector of outcomes).\n"
