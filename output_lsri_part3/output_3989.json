        "value": "It may be desirable to run probe design again on a different set of targets without\nrebuilding the transcript index used for off-target screening. This can be accomplished\nby running a different version of the Snakefile and providing a different parameter\nfile called indices.csv. In this case, you must also provide the path to the fasta\ncontaining your target sequences in the targets.csv file. See example in example_outdir/design_params_prebuilt/. You can leave the target_homology field blank for the organism(s)\nthat you are using for building the target consensus, but you must provide it for any additional organisms that you are screening candidate probes against if they are not\nincluded in building the target consensus.\n\nRun the pipeline using a pre-built transcript index:\n\n    snakemake -s use_prebuilt_indices.smk --directory <your output directory>\n\nIf you are unhappy with the probes the pipeline chooses or you want to choose probes other\nthan those at Tm peaks, you can choose probes directly from the potential_probes_filt.csv file\nthat is in the output directory named for the target (e.g. 18S/potential_probes_filt.csv).\nThese probes have all passed screening with the user-selected sequence and specificity checking criteria.\n\nOne additional analysis that the pipeline does is to check for potential heterodimers between\nall selected probes and discard probes that have an unacceptably low delta G for\nheterodimer formation. If you select probes directly from the potential_probes_filt.csv\nfile, then you may want to check this yourself. A simple way to check heterodimer\nformation would be to use the calc_dimer() function from choose_probes.py, e.g.:\n\n    import pandas as pd\n    import choose_probes\n    df = pd.read_csv('my_candidate_probes.csv', index_col = 'unique_id')\n    df[['dimer_dG','dimer_partner']] = choose_probes.calc_dimer(df)\n    df.to_csv('my_candidate_probes_wdimers.csv')\n\nIf you simply want to add one additional probe to an existing probe set (for example,\nif you ran the pipeline a second time with more relaxed constraints to find probes\nin a difficult-to-target region), you can use the add_extra_probe.py script.\n\n    python add_extra_probe.py my_probes.csv candidate_extra_probes.csv expanded_probeset -10\n\nThis would create a new file named expanded_probeset.csv with one additional probe from\ncandidate_extra_probes.csv that had > -10 delta G predicted heterodimer with any of\nthe other probes. Both input csv files should have the 'unique_id' field. For example,\nmy_probes.csv could be the output probe set from a pipeline run and candidate_extra_probes.csv\ncould be a selection of probes from the protential_probes_filt.csv file.\n"
