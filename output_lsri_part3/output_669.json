Accordingly, 2000*0.2 = 400 genes were designed as DEGs. Of these, the first 90% (i.e., 400*0.9 = 360 DEG1 genes) were up-regulated in group 1 and the remaining 10% (400*0.1 = 40 DEG2 genes) were up-regulated in group 2. Although the latter gene number is small, the degree of FC (FC2 = 9) is much larger than that of the former (i.e., FC1 = 4); We hypothesized that the 40 DEG2 genes could also form distinct clusters. Therefore the truth of this dataset is as follows: the first 360 genes (gene_1, gene_2, ..., and gene_360) have the DEG1 pattern, the next 40 genes (gene_361, gene_362, ..., and gene_400) have the DEG2 pattern, and the remaining 1,600 genes (gene_401, gene_402, ..., gene_2000) have the non-DEG pattern.\n \n"

By executing this file with the default parameter settings, one can obtain a tab-delimited text file (named \"sample_MBCdeg1.txt\") as the output. The output file has seven columns of information added to the right side of the input file. The first three columns (named \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\") correspond to the posterior probabilities (PPs) assigned to individual clusters. The next column (named \"PP_nonDEG\") corresponds to the PPs determined as non-DEG cluster. In this case, we see the third cluster (named \"3\") was identified as the non-DEG cluster. The fifth column (named \"ranking\") corresponds to overall gene ranking that is obtained based on the non-DEG PPs. The sixth column (named \"pat\") corresponds to the pattern name assigned to each gene (either \"DEG1\", \"DEG2\" or \"non-DEG\"). The information of the last column (named \"clust_num\") corresponds to the cluster name (either \"1\", \"2\" or \"3\")is essentially the same as that of the sixth column. In this case, the first, second, and third clusters correspond to DEG2, DEG1, and non-DEG patterns, respectively. The information displayed on the \"R Console\" screen may also be useful.\n \n"
