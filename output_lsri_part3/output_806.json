        "value": "Hello, and thank you for using Batch-Mask! This workflow utilizes a customized region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model to generate masks of snakes in photographs (see our accompanying paper [https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icac036]) but can be applied to various organisms with limbless or nonstandard body forms. The neural network uses the training process to fine-tune mask weights from pre-trained weights provided with Mask R-CNN. We have included all necessary code in this repository for utilizing Batch-Mask on Google Colaboratory, as well as a version of the ImageJ software for Windows with the necessary plugins for dataset labeling and MicaToolbox Pattern analysis. \n\nThis README file includes a tutorial and information for 1) implementing Batch-Mask on a sample dataset of snake images to reproduce the results of our paper, 2) implementing Batch-Mask on a custom set of images using our pre-trained weights, 3) training the neural network on a custom set of images and using the resulting weights to implement Batch-Mask on a custom set of images, and 4) preparing Batch-Mask outputs for downstream analyses in MicaToolbox.\n\n<a name=\"1\"></a>"

This is the most universal style of output.\n* \"splash\" will output a .jpg copy of the original image but with a blue overlay showing which portions of the image are not included in the mask. This is a non-functional output but can be used to determine the qualitative performance of the neural network. \nType the desired output type in the cell block before pressing play. To use multiple output types, you can separate them using the '&' character. For example, to create outputs for both \"binary\" and \"splash\", you would set the output type to be \"binary&splash\". Output folders are specified in the config file and are located in the snake-session folder. \nIf you need to resume detection because Google Colab timed out or you ran into resource limits, set resume equal to True in the cell block and run again; Batch-Mask will resume from the last output file in the output folder. \n"

To do this, simply create a .csv file, and in the first column, enter a list of all the source images to be masked. Mask ROI names will be created using any text or values entered in columns after Column A (up to three columns).

In our snake image dataset, and in many datasets that include visible and/or UV color standards, all photos included a circular color standard of known radius. If your images contain a circular standard and your output type is \u201cjson\u201d, you can enable this scale bar detection step by editing Lines 12 and 13 of the config file. Simply enter the radius of the standard (our gray UV standard had a radius of 16.6085mm) into Line 12 and set \u201cCALCULATE_SCALE_BAR\u201d equal to \u201cTrue\u201d in Line 13. You may need to add a \u201c[SCALE BAR]\u201d section to the bottom of the config file. Here, you specify the minimum radius (in pixels) that the algorithm uses to find the circular standard. For our snake dataset, 550 pixels worked for all but one image.
