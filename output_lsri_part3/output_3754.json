        "value": "This is a database designed for the new task named Continual/Lifelong learning for remote sensing image scene classification. The existing remote sensing image scene classification datasets use static benchmarks and lack the standard to divide the datasets into several sequential learning training batches, which largely limits the development of Continual/Lifelong learning in remote sensing image scene classification. \nSplitting the training set into several batches is essential to train and test Continual/Lifelong learning approaches which are currently receiving much attention. Unfortunately, most of the existing datasets are not well suited to this purpose because they lack a fundamental ingredient: the presence of multiple (unconstrained) views of the same objects taken in different sessions.  \nIn this dataset, we consider three Continual/Lifelong learning scenarios: \n\n* New Instances (NI): new training patterns of the same classes becomes available in subsequent batches with new poses and environment conditions. A good model is expected to incrementally consolidate its knowledge about the known classes without compromising what it learned before. \n* New Classes (NC): new training patterns belonging to different classes becomes available in subsequent batches. In this case the model should be able to deal with the new classes without losing accuracy on the previous ones. \n* New Instances and Classes (NIC): new training patterns belonging both to known and new classes becomes available in subsequent training batches. A good model is expected to consolidate its knowledge about the known classes and to learn the new ones.\n \n"
