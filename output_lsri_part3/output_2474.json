To fill this gap, this work describes an algorithm that recalibrates each spectrum individually by estimating its mass shift with the help of a list of internal calibrating ions. The method exploits RANSAC (*Random Sample Consensus*) algorithm, to select, in a robust manner, the experimental signal corresponding to internal calibrating signals by filtering out calibration points with infrequent mass errors and by using the remaining points to estimate a linear model of the mass shifts. \nThe method developed in the paper is divided into 5 steps. (1) The generation of a list of internal calibrating ions for the whole MSI data according to similar public MSI datasets from METASPACE (i.e., representing the same kind of biological samples) since we assume them to share metabolites with the sample of interest. (2) Centroid MS spectra are extracted from each pixel. (3) The calibrant hits are generated by computing the mass errors between the list of potential internal calibrating ions and the spectrum signals for each pixel. (4) The preferential calibrant hits are selected as those with the most frequent mass errors with the aim to select true hits. (5) A linear model for predicting the mass shifts based on the preferential hits is then constructed and applied to all spectra for their recalibration. \nThis repository contains the scripts performing all the steps of the method developed in the paper. The code to generate the evaluation plots will be added in the future.\n \n"

The <code>-st</code> argument allows to modify the bandwidth of the density estimation of the errors. The <code>-tl</code> argument allows to modify the tolerance in Dalton for the hits generation. It should be large enough to take into consideration all the possible mass shifts occurring in the MSI. Finally, the <code>-lm</code> argument is the tolerance window in Dalton around the most frequent mass error.\n\nFor lower precision mass analyzers, all those parameters should be increased, \nfor example MSI acquired with a rapifleX we suggest that the user introduce the following settings <code>-st 0.03</code>, \n<code>-tl 0.8</code> and <code>-lm 0.08</code>. \n\nCare should be taken for lower-resolution instruments as they were not the subject of this paper. \nHowever, to give an idea of the possible range of values for the arguments, we suggest that the user introduce the following settings <code>-st 0.03</code>, \n<code>-tl 0.8</code> and <code>-lm 0.08</code> for rapifleX data which can be considered as the upper limit of the algorithm.\n\n"
