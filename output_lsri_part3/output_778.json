It combines state-of-the-art classifiers such as Kraken2, Centrifuge and BLAST with downstream analysis steps to provide a framework for the analysis of in-progress sequencing runs. NanoRTax retrieves the final output files in the same structure/format for every classifier which enables more comprehensive tool/database comparison and better benchmarking capabilities. Additionally, NanoRTax includes a web application (./viz_webapp/) for visualizing complete or partial pipeline outputs. \n\n\nThe NanoRTax pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with conda environments and docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.\n"

Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for full pipeline reproducibility or use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)\n\niii. Download the pipeline and example databases and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command\n\n```bash\n#UPDATE:Taxonomic data necessary for taxonkit\nwget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz\ntar -xzvf taxdump.tar.gz -C db/\n#BLAST database\nmkdir db db/taxdb\nwget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/16S_ribosomal_RNA.tar.gz && tar -xzvf 16S_ribosomal_RNA.tar.gz -C db\nwget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/taxdb.tar.gz && tar -xzvf taxdb.tar.gz -C db/taxdb\n#Kraken2 RDP database\nwget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/data/kraken2_dbs/16S_RDP11.5_20200326.tgz && tar -xzvf 16S_RDP11.5_20200326.tgz -C db\n#Centrifuge P_COMPRESSED database (more information: https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/manual.shtml#database-download-and-index-building)\nwget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/centrifuge/p_compressed_2018_4_15.tar.gz && tar -xzvf p_compressed_2018_4_15.tar.gz -C db\n```\n\n```bash\nnextflow run main.nf -profile test,<docker/conda>\n```\n\niv. Start running your own analysis!\n\nWe provide an example configuration profile with the default parameters for running the pipeline (conf/default.config) and it is a good starting point to easily customize your NanoRTax workflow. This configuration is loaded by specifying \"default\" in the profiles list of pipeline command. \n\na. Run classification on a single FASTQ file\n```bash\nnextflow run main.nf -profile <default,docker/conda> --reads '/seq_path/sample.fastq'\n```\nb. Run classification on an entire sequencing run directory. NanoRTax will detect the barcode directories and analyze all samples:\n```bash\nnextflow run main.nf -profile <default,docker/conda> --reads '/seq_path/fastq_pass/**/*.fastq'\n```\n\nc. Real-time mode.\n\n```bash\nnextflow run main.nf -profile <default,docker/conda> --reads_rt '/seq_path/fastq_pass/**/*.fastq'\n```\n\nSimilar to the normal mode but using --reads_rt for input. Partial results are stored in an output directory and are accessible as .csv file and web app visualization files. In this mode, the workflow will run endlessly, so it needs to be stopped manually by Ctrl+C once all  FASTQ files are completely processed.\n\nNote: This mode is intended to work with non-bulk FASTQ files (ie: 500 reads per file) in order to provide a fluid real-time analysis of generated reads. This aspect can be configured before starting the experiment via MinKNOW sequencing software.\n\nv. Visualize partial/complete outputs using NanoRTax web application (./viz_webapp)\n\nBefore running the web application, make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed or use the provided viz_webapp/environment.yml file to build a conda environment (recommended):\n\n```bash\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate nanortax_webapp\n```\nStart the **web application** server with the command below and access the interface with a web browser (http://127.0.0.1:8050/ by default).\n\n```bash\ncd viz_webapp && python dashboard.py\n```\n\nSee [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.\n\n"
