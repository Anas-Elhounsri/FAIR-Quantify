Read more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=powershell)\n\n````\n\n## Installing Python\n\nTo use Scarf you need the Python programming language, version 3.10 or upwards, installed.\n\n**Step 1:**\n\nFirst, check whether you already have Python installed. To do so, you need to open a terminal\nwindow (aka command prompt).\n\n```{eval-rst}\n.. tabs::\n\n  .. tab:: Linux\n\n     Pressing key combination `Ctrl+Alt+T` together works on most Linux distributions.\n\n  .. tab:: Windows\n\n     If you have Anaconda installed and see it in the Start Menu then you can skip this step.\n\n     Press `Win+R` keys on your keyboard. Then, type `cmd` and press `Enter`.\n    \n\n  .. tab:: MacOS\n\n     Press `CMD+Space` to open spotlight search, and type `terminal` and hit `RETURN`.\n\n```\n\n**Step 2:**\n\nOkay, once you have got a terminal window open, type `python --version` and press `ENTER`:\n\nNow you may see one of the following three kinds of output:\n\n- If your output shows you have `Python 3.11.0` or a more recent version.\n  In this case, you are good to go, and you can skip Step 3.\n- If you have an earlier version than 3.10, for example 3.5 or 2.7, then see step 3.\n- If you see an error containing words `not found` or `not recognized` then most\n  likely you do not have a Python version installed on your system. Move to step 3.\n- On Windows you may see a blank line which means that either Python is not installed or that Windows doesn't know where it is installed\n\n\n**Step 3:**\n\nTo install the latest version of Python, we suggest using Miniconda. Download appropriate\nversion based on your operating system from here:\nhttps://conda.io/miniconda.html (version Python 3.10 or above).\n\n64-bit version will be suitable for most of the users. If you are confused about 64-bit or 32-bit see this nice\n[post](https://www.techsoup.org/support/articles-and-how-tos/do-i-need-the-32bit-or-64bit)\n\nOnce you have downloaded Miniconda please follow their instructions\n[here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation)\nto install it.\n\nOnce installed, please confirm that you now have a Python version greater than 3.10.0 by\ntyping `python --version` in your terminal. (On Windows if you see a `Anaconda3` directory on your Start Menu then it\nmeans that Python is installed, and you don't need to check on terminal)\n\n**Additional steps for Windows:**\n\nWindows does not come with essential build tools for compiling C and C++ code. We need to install these:\n- Click on `Download Build Tools` from this webpage: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools\n- Run the downloaded file and in the `Workloads` section check the module called: `Desktop development with C++`.\n- Click on `Install` button on lower right corner.\n\nThat's it now you have the required build tools.\n\n\n**Step 3.5 (Optional but highly recommended)**\n\nWe recommend that you first create an environment that you then install scarf into. \nIf you have followed the steps above, and you are using conda you create an environment\nby typing ``conda create --name scarf_env python=3.11`` in your terminal (Windows users must use Anaconda Prompt)\n\nThis will also install python 3.10 into that environment. One of the benefits of working with\nenvironments is that you minimize the risk of some required package that you are using for\nsomething different (e.g. if you have another package that requires numpy to be of an older\nversion) is being updated without you wanting it to. This way you can keep the installation\ncontained.\n\nTo activate the environment type `conda activate scarf_env`. \nTo know more about conda's environment management check this out: \nhttps://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\n\n\n**Step 4:**\n\nNow, in your terminal, type this to install the latest version of Scarf:\n`pip install scarf[extra]`\n\n**Step 4.5 (Optional)**\n\nMost users will use Scarf as in an interactive environment using Jupyter notebooks/lab.\nYou can install Jupyter lab like using command: `pip install jupyterlab` .\nThereafter, you can launch the Jupyter server by typing `jupyter lab`\n\n\n**Additional steps for Windows:**\nRun the following command before launching Jupyter server for the first time: `conda install -y pywin32`\n"
