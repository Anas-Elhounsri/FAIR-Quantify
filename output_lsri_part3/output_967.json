Please ask questions if you're unsure of anything.\n\nWe follow [this](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) git branch model. In particular:\n\n* The `master` branch is for stable versions only. Usually only tagged releases will be commited to `master`.\n* The `develop` branch is the main working branch. Only small changes should be commited directly to this branch.\n* New major features should branch from `develop` and be named like `feature/name`.\n* Minor bug fixes should branch from the relevant branch and be named like `fix/name`.\n* Experimental work should branch from the relevant branch and be named like `exp/name`.\n\n## Style\n\nPlease try to adhere to the existing code style, in particular:\n\n#### Naming\n\n* Variable names are all lower case and seperated with underscores (e.g. `foo_bar`).\n* Type names (including template types and aliases) are UpperCamelCase (e.g. `FooBar`).\n* Function names are all lower case and seperated_with_underscores (e.g. `foor_bar()`).\n* `enum` and `enum class` members are all lower case and seperated with underscores (e.g. `foo_bar`).\n* `constexpr` variables are lowerCamelCase (e.g. `fooBar`).\n* Global variables are lowerCamelCase (e.g. `fooBar`).\n\n#### Brackets\n\n* Classes and functions start with an open bracket on the next line, e.g:\n\n```cpp\nclass Foo\n{\n    // code\n};\n\nint bar(int x)\n{\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n* Loops and if statements open the bracket on the same line, e.g:\n\n```cpp\nfor (;;) {\n    // stuff\n}\n\nif (something) {\n    // stuff\n} else {\n    // other stuff\n}\n```\n\n* Small `if` statements can appear on the same line if it improves readability:\n\n```cpp\nif (something) return true;\n```\n\n#### Namespaces\n\n* All code goes in the `octopus namespace`.\n* The open bracket appears on the same line as the `namespace` name (e.g. `namespace octopus {`).\n\n#### Misc\n\n* Use 4 spaces for tab indentation.\n* There is no strict limit for line lengths; use best judgement. \n"

        "value": "---\nid: installation\ntitle: Installation\n---\n\nOctopus can be built and installed on most Unix based systems (e.g. Linux and MacOS). Windows has not been tested.\n\nThe recommend way to install Octopus for most users is:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone -b master https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus.git\n$ octopus/scripts/install.py --dependencies --forests\n```\n\nYou can then optionally add `octopus` to your `PATH`:\n\n```shell\n$ echo 'export PATH='$(pwd)'/octopus/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\n$ source ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\nThen check the installation was successful:\n\n```shell\n$ octopus --version\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n* A [C++14](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp14) compiler and compatibility standard library. Either [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) (version >= 9.3) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) (version >= 11.0) are recommended.\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com) version >= 2.5\n* [Boost](https://www.boost.org) version >= 1.65\n* [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib) version >= 1.4; version != 1.12\n* [GMP](https://gmplib.org) version >= 5.1.0\n* [CMake](https://cmake.org) version >= 3.9\n* Optional:\n    * [Python](https://www.python.org) version >= 3 plus the [distro](https://pypi.org/project/distro/) package\n\n:::important\n\nOctopus uses [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) instructions for performance reasons. The instruction set used (minimum [SSE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2)) is built statically, so if you compile with [AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_2), you won't be able to use the resulting binary on machines that doesn't support AVX2.\n\n:::\n\n## Python\n\nFirst clone the git repository in your preferred directory:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone -b master https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus.git && cd octopus\n```\n\nThe easiest way to install Octopus from source is with the Python3 installer script. To see the options available to this script run `scripts/install.py --help`.\n\nIf all the requirements are accessible on your `PATH` then simply run\n\n```shell\n$ scripts/install.py\n```\n\notherwise you can specify paths to each dependency, for example, to set the compiler you'd use \n\n```shell\n$ scripts/install.py --cxx_compiler /path/to/cpp/compiler\n```\n\nBy default, this installs to `/bin` relative to where octopus is installed. To install to a different location (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`) use:\n\n```shell\n$ scripts/install.py --prefix /user/local/bin\n```\n\nYou can also request all dependencies to be installed locally:\n\n```shell\n$ scripts/install.py --dependencies\n```\n\n:::tip\n\nIf a build isn't working after an update then try adding `--clean` to the install command.\n\n:::\n\n### Setting the build architecture\n\nBy default, the binary is optimised for the build machine architecture. If you need to run Octopus on another machine with a different architecture then use the `--architecture` option:\n\n```shell\n$ scripts/install.py --architecture haswell\n```\n\nThis is passed to the [-march](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html) compiler option. \n\n## CMake\n\nIf Python3 isn't available, Octopus can be installed directly with [CMake](https://cmake.org):\n\n```shell\n$ git clone -b master https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus.git\n$ cd octopus/build\n$ cmake .. && make install\n```\n\nCMake will try to find a suitable compiler on your system, if you'd like you use a specific compiler use the `-D` option, for example:\n\n```shell\n$ cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ..\n```\n\n## Docker\n\nPre-built Docker images are available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dancooke/octopus):\n\n```shell\n$ docker pull dancooke/octopus\n$ docker run dancooke/octopus -h\n```\n\n:::important\n\nThe Octopus images on DockerHub are built to a [Haswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)) architecture. This means that they will only work on  Haswell (with AVX2) or newer machines.\n\n:::\n\nYou can also build a new image from the Dockerfile:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus.git && cd octopus\n$ docker build -t octopus .\n$ docker run octopus -h\n```\n\nThis is especially useful if you need to build to a specific architecture:\n\n```shell\n$ docker build -t octopus --build-args architecture=sandybridge .\n```\n\n## Singularity\n\nTo build a [Singularity](https://singularity.hpcng.org) container directly from the DockerHub images use\n\n```shell\n$ singularity build octopus.sif docker://dancooke/octopus\n```\n\n## Conda\n\nOctopus is available [pre-built for Linux](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/octopus) as part of [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/):\n\n```shell\n$ conda install -c bioconda octopus\n```\n\n:::important\n\nThe Octopus package on Bioconda is built to a [Haswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_(microarchitecture)) architecture. This means that it will only work on  Haswell (with AVX2) or newer machines. If you need another architecture then consider using [conda-build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/).\n\n:::"

        "description": "This is a major release since `v0.6.3-beta` and is the first non-`beta` release. Highlights include:\r\n\r\n- The pair HMM used for the core haplotype likelihood model has been completely re-written to support AVX2 and AVX-512 instruction sets. This can result in some nice performance improvements on machines supporting these instructions. Also, the HMM now supports variable band-widths and 32-bit integer scores, which is necessary to evaluate long reads.\r\n- [Evidence BAMs](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/How-to:-Make-evidence-BAMs) are now annotated with supporting haplotype(s) and other information. Automatic 'splitting' by haplotype is gone but there is a [script] provided to do this.\r\n- Octopus is now paired and linked read aware! Reads are assumed paired by default, but can be assumed unpaired or linked with the [`--read-linkage`](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Command-line-reference#option---read-linkage) option. This improves accuracy and phasing for most analysis.\r\n- [Random forests](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Variant-filtering:-Random-Forest) now store the annotations used for training as meta information in the forest file, allowing different annotations to be used for different forests. Note that this change makes previous forest versions incompatible with this version, it also means that a [modified ranger](https://github.com/dancooke/ranger) must be used for training (the main [ranger](https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger) package does not store variable names in the meta info).\r\n- Allele-level annotations (e.g. `AD`) are now supported; they can be requested with the [`--annotations`](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Command-line-reference#option---annotations) option.\r\n- The phasing algorithm has been completely re-written to improve accuracy and to allow discontiguous phase sets, which can frequently occur in some analysis (e.g. linked reads, or somatic phasing). \r\n- Calling from PacBio CCS reads is now supported - although improvements are still needed, especially regarding runtime. See the [PacBio CCS config](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/blob/develop/resources/configs/PacBioCCS.config).\r\n- The haplotype generator now supports 'backtracking' - where a block of partially resolved haplotypes is buffered, and then restored when downstream haplotypes have also been partially resolved. This can lead to long haplotypes much faster than keeping all haplotypes in the tree simultaneously. Backtracking is turned off by default, but can be. enabled by using [`--backtrack-level`](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Command-line-reference#option---backtrack-level) option.\r\n- Mixing of distinct sample ploidies is now supported by the [population calling model](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Calling-models:-Population).\r\n- Overflows on `QUAL` and `GQ` have been reduced allowing for much greater ranges on these statistics.\r\n- The use of `*` `ALT` allele has been brought inline with the [updated VCF v4.3 specification](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/pull/464). The `--legacy` option has therefore been removed.\r\n- New `RFGQ_ALL` `INFO` measure for random forest filtered runs - the empirical probability (Phred) of all genotypes being correct (derived from each `FORMAT` `RFGQ`). Use this for filtering tumour-normal calls etc.\r\n- Handling of ALT supplementary alignments (for GRCh38 etc) has been improved, resulting in better accuracy.\r\n- Polyploid calling much faster, especially when the [`--max-genotypes`](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Command-line-reference#option---max-genotypes) option is used (recommended for anything over triploid).\r\n- The local re-assembler now automatically considers the average region depth when evaluating bubbles, resulting in fewer spurious candidate variants.\r\n- The local re-assembler no longer allows cyclic graphs by default, resulting in far fewer spurious candidates with very little loss in sensitivity.  Cyclic graphs can be re-enabled with the [`--allow-cycles`](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Command-line-reference#command---allow-cycles) option.\r\n- Haplotypes (i.e. phased `GT` entires) are now reported in a consistent manner - always lexicographical (w.r.t the implied haplotype). This breaks the previous rule that somatic haplotypes always appeared after germline ones - somatic haplotypes are now identified with the `HSS` `FORMAT` annotation.\r\n- The way genotypes are represented has been completely re-written, resulting in some nice runtime performance improvements for all calling models.\r\n- The way filtering measures are calculated has been re-written, resulting in a nice runtime performance improvement for filtering.\r\n- The way Octopus identifies 'uncallable' regions that tend to slow down analysis has been much improved, resulting in much better runtimes.\r\n- Automatic dependency installation in the [installation script](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/blob/develop/scripts/install.py) has been much improved, and is now the recommend way to install Octopus on all operating systems.\r\n- Many bug fixes.",

        "description": "This is the first beta release as most of the core features are reasonably mature. There have been various stability and runtime improvements, in addition to improvements to the core algorithm - including a completely new indel mutation model. Once again, the cancer calling model has received most attention, particularly for high depth ultra-low VAF tumour-only calling (e.g. UMI).\r\n\r\n## General\r\n\r\n- Overhaul of the indel mutation model which controls priors on germline, somatic, and *de novo* mutations. Gap open and extensions conditional on local repeat context and current gap length are modelled. [bd0eb24bfd09efacbadb306af3a0af15827b7015, 20f5d9ff1facdfee90b2c88b8b603986b0e01fce]\r\n- A brand new candidate variant generator! Named *RepeatScanner*, this generator looks for likely misaligned SNV runs in microsatellites and proposes indels. This can result in more biologically realistic calls in these regions. This generator is controlled with the `--repeat-candidate-generator` command line option. [2856c2e6b8a5683f07c19d3f40e1c2f3b467bacd , 2856c2e6b8a5683f07c19d3f40e1c2f3b467bacd]\r\n- Evidence BAMs for multi-sample input, including 'split' evidence BAMs. [face5fb7d7627154b1628f11a4aed64cd25a51ad, e56641c75c92cd104463fd3435a0fea0d3807793]\r\n- The way `QUAL` is calculated in the cancer and trio models has been improved. Previously `QUAL` was the posterior probability the called alt allele segregated **and** is classified correctly. This could lead to low `QUAL` scores if the classification was uncertain (e.g. in tumour-only samples). `QUAL` is now simply the posterior probability the allele segregates. There is also a new annotation for all cancer caller calls, and `DENOVO` trio calls, `PP`, that is equivalent to the old `QUAL`. [905c96b7362ba2513c920e33d896751490cc32f0, 3b28e9fe85af4aef4408cb3b31c959408a0ba129, 0d1537b9012326d4e8e3d98d718e0f81ff73219e]\r\n- Candidate variant generators are now more sensitive to very low frequency variation (<1% VAF). [d3e36316c47c7d736fde48611baaef408f7078c9]\r\n- `SOMATIC` have a new annotation: `MAP_VAF` which reports theMaximum a posteriori VAF estimate. \r\n- New measures to use for threshold and random forest filtering. [11ff14faaa141ddb290dd31f6a2686adf5f51269]\r\n- Complete refactor of the core cancer caller genotype models results in some runtime improvements. [d3e5a5a0fc11e3462b63de8e7cc6c3c36080c006]\r\n- Better Variational Bayes seed generation for cancer genotypes, especially good news for lower frequency mutations. [2fadf78a51844d30ff464c72931075167cfa15d1]\r\n- Improved somatic model fitting for high ploidy somatic genotypes in cancer caller. [2d7573c334f880aecbb064b0e5994149eff10815]\r\n- Improved use of indexing in the individual caller results in ~5% speedup. [b6bba8a947d1f7c91044874479b8174b94540fdd, 16a3cc5a22f9405585fce7e6cca2b47ff609d977, 9c951d2c17dd92fca8ab1778b883fa45f825ffeb]\r\n- Better identification of messy regions that slow down calling. [5326835a901c0a542b792a51781bae4730bfaba3 , 8208a204fd08c21f980d1fdbf1197168cf00fcfb]\r\n- The assembler now considers observed read strands and reduce the score of bubbles with high strand bias. [50da8040f04af3c3c9eea5180d2d635b6cf76125] \r\n- Filtering measures can now be parameterised by user input. [e1ab33090304ff6acd1109dcf2d92248f8354d47]\r\n- The way some measures consider ambiguous reads has been improved which can prevent some biases previously observed. [7e2f635a2a9745396b8f46f70aaed959d068fe06]\r\n- Adds support for calling chromosome Y in trios. [41b72b22663d91e08b63121ba2a7624485a99003]\r\n- Adds a \"data profiler\" that can be used to build a profile of polymorphisms and errors present in the data. Currently this only profiles indels. This feature is currently experimental and is primarily intended to be used to improve indel error models. [99ad1e94f1e506051dc8b61d6f623bdbef92184a]\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixes a bug that could lead to segmentation faults during haplotype generation. [1ecd74e7a45f2337426728e90bf5a3c90f52592a]\r\n- Fixes a problem reading lists of floats from VCF files that could result in garbage output (e.g. for `VAF_CR`) [e361f5065da83a9d1febabf4dcac9c7578dc3e8e].\r\n- Fix GCC 8 warning which caused compile error. [58b51fd14b73bf5dbcd8f50a4d9704f39acf985f, 3733b09e643de92226010dd866006786fd609375]\r\n- Fixes some instances of compiler based non-determinism that could result in different results between compilers. [d01819396161e76a14cc1605d63da2abf35901aa, e66169e5724ce3251fd3071a01a5d5e8e1db1599]\r\n\r\n## Interface changes\r\n\r\n- Adds command line option `--max-vb-seeds` which controls the maximum number of seeds the Variational Bayes based genotype model algorithms can use. [95c66a2ec89fe37adb8a4707d15b69bf17f25563]\r\n- Adds `--split-bamout` for split realigned BAMs. Split BAMs are no longer requested by specifying a prefix to `--bamout`. [34d8a89748cd363e967cea89774531efa73a9dbb]\r\n- The measure `SC` has been renamed to `NC` (Normal Contamination). [23497c3aaf0c93c9ca633f96778f8f74c4a5a4b3]\r\n-- Adds `--mask-tails` for unconditionally masking bases of all read tails. [acfddaf1b5e910496b737f3dd6cab2667dadae4b]\r\n- Adds `--tumour-germline-concentration` which may be used to control shape of prior distribution on haplotype mixture frequency of tumour samples. Only really relevant to high depth tumour-only calling. [9f83ca6fce24ced6ea901845f3c474ecfc6a1867]\r\n- Renames `--snv-denovo-mutation-rate` to `--denovo-snv-mutation-rate` and `--indel-denovo-mutation-rate` to `--denovo-indel-mutation-rate`. [4b9d95f448ef1f8d2375947a58d664850a868c18]\r\n- Adds `--repeat-candidate-generator` to control new repeat candidate generator. [2856c2e6b8a5683f07c19d3f40e1c2f3b467bacd]\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- There is now a `configs` directory in the main project directory that contains pre-written configs for calling certain types of data.

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/How-to:-Make-evidence-BAMs) for details.\r\n\r\n## Calling improvements\r\n\r\n* The cancer caller can now model more than one somatic haplotype which improves calling sensitivity, and also allows somatic phasing. See [cancer calling model wiki](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Calling-models:-Cancer) for more details.\r\n* Optimisation of the cancer model improves sensitivity for low frequency mutations.\r\n* New unified indel mutation model used for germline, de-novo, and somatic indel calling.\r\n* New filter Measures. See [wiki](https://github.com/luntergroup/octopus/wiki/Variant-filtering) for full list.\r\n* Tumour-only calling now much faster and more accurate.\r\n* Uses variant prior model to deduplicate haplotypes for all models, resulting in more biologically realistic calls.\r\n* `DENOVO` and `SOMATIC` calls now get different filtering treatment to regular germline variants using threshold filters.\r\n\r\n## Interface changes\r\n\r\n* Added `--forest-file` and `--somatic-forest-file` for random forest filtering.\r\n* Added `--somatics-only` to report only `SOMATIC` variants.\r\n* Added `--denovos-only` to report only `DENOVO` variants.\r\n* Added `--max-somatic-haplotypes` which limits the number of somatic haplotypes that may be used by the `cancer` calling model.\r\n* `--consider-reads-with-unmapped-segments` --> `--no-reads-with-unmapped-segments` and `--consider-reads-with-distant-segments` --> `--no-reads-with-distant-segments`. These filters are now off my default.\r\n* `--max-cancer-genotypes` removed and replaced with `--max-genotypes`, which is also used by the `polyclone` calling model.\r\n* Added `--max-clones` option for specifying the maximum number of clones for the `polyclone` calling model.\r\n* Added `--somatic-filter-expression`,  `--denovo-filter-expression`, and `--refcall-filter-expression` which may be used for hard filtering 'DENOVO' and `SOMATIC`calls.",

        "description": "This version brings new features, in addition to significant calling and runtime improvements.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- CSR filtering can be run on a user supplied octopus VCF file, without running calling (`--filter-vcf` command line option).\r\n- Micro-inversions and complex rearrangements are callable.\r\n\r\n## Calling improvements\r\n\r\n- Better handling of variants in tandem repeat regions, in particular, many cases that would previously have been called as a series of SNV's, are now called as an insertion-deletion pair, which is more biologically plausible.\r\n- Improved the SNV error model to stop some true heterozygous SNV's being called as homozygous.\r\n\r\n## Runtime improvements\r\n\r\n- CSR filtering is fully parallelised. Like for calling, this is activated with the `--threads` command. This resolves #13.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Various fixes to the way haplotypes are reconstructed from VCF, which lead to some edge cases being misclassified.\r\n\r\n## Interface changes\r\n\r\n- The helper Python install script `install.py` is now supplied with both a C++ and C compiler with the `cxx_compiler` and `c_compiler` commands respectively.\r\n- Supplementary alignments are now filtered by default (`--no-supplementary-alignments` changes to `--allow-supplementary-alignments`).\r\n- Secondary alignments are now filtered by default (`--no-secondary-alignments` changes to `--allow-secondary-alignments`).\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n\r\n- htslib is now linked dynamically by default, which means its requirements do not need to be explicitly linked also. This resolves #16. Be sure to clean any CMake caches before rebuilding (`--clean` with Python install script).\r\n- `.vcf.gz` index files are now in the `.tbi` format, rather than `.csi`.",

Although this doesn't offer true joint calling, it at-least offers consistent output until such time as a proper model is implemented.\r\n- Somatic mutation calling is now significantly faster and more accurate due to model optimisation.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug with haplotype filtering that could cause haplotypes not to be filtered, and also result in inconsistent results between runs.\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n\r\n- VCF records now include AC and AN INFO fields.\r\n- Added an official logo!\r\n- Protect called haplotypes from filtering when using holdouts.\r\n- Octopus will now always emit a call if the variant posterior is above the given threshold, even if the homozygous reference genotype is MAP.\r\n- The max QUAL is now 10000.\r\n",

This can be used to invoke the trio calling model instead of specifying maternal and paternal samples. If exactly three samples are given, and the given pedigree contains those samples as a trio, then the trio calling model will be used.\n\n## Other changes\n- The default target read memory footprint limit (`--target-read-buffer-footprint`) has been increased to 4GB.\n- Static library linking is now possible by adding the `--static` option to the python installer.\n- Compiler warnings have been eliminated for Clang.\n",

In particular specificity has been significantly improved. A model posterior is now reported by default which can be used to hard filter calls. Runtime has been improved, but still needs much work. \n- The assembler can now selectively extracts bubbles of a minimum weight, increasing both specificity and sensitivity.\n\n## Other changes\n- Command line options have been added for the new features.\n- The command line options `--debug` and `--trace` can now take arguments (file paths) to write the respective logs to.\n- Downsampling limits have been increased.\n- Some other command line option names and default values have changed.\n",
