With the help of a board-certified radiologist, we went through X-ray images of COVID-19 samples, and only kept those which were selceted to have a clear sign of COVID-19 by our radiologist. We also only kept the posterior-anterior images.  \nFor Non-COVID samples, we tried to uniformly sample images from ChexPert. More details on the dataset are provided in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09363.pdf). \nAs the number of COVID-19 samples are much fewer than the number of Non-COVID samples, we used several data-augmentation techniques (as well as over-sampling) to increase the number of COVID-19 samples in training, to have a less imbalanced training set. Hopefully more cleanly labeled X-ray images from COVID-19 cases become available soon, so we do not have this imbalanced data issue. \nFor data augmentation, we have used the [Augmentor](https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor) library in Python.\n \n"
