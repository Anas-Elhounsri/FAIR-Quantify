        "value": "Somatic variant callers compare matched pairs of tumor-normal samples to produce variant calls. The results can be extremely rich in false positives due to confounding factors such as the purity of the samples, artifacts introduced by sequencing chemistry, the alignment algorithm and the incomplete and repetitive nature of reference genomes.  \r\nIt has become common practice to attempt to ameliorate these effects using a variety of filtering techniques, including taking the intersect of results from multiple variant callers and employing some post-calling filtering. This ad-hoc filtering varies greatly between laboratories.  Attempts have been made to standardize the methodology of this filtering, with recommendations produced by the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) [(Alioto et al., 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682041/).  \r\nWe have developed Filters for Next Generation Sequencing (FiNGS), software written specifically to address these filtering issues. FiNGS can implement the ICGC filtering standards and has filters and thresholds that are fully configurable, which substantially increases the precision of results and provides high quality variants for further analysis. \r\n\r"

All C>A|G>T variants are classified as being part of two binomial distributions, one centered at 0.5 (50% artifact orientation, 50% non-artifact orientation) and the other at the filter value (defautl is 0.9, which is 90% artifact orientation reads).  C>A|G>T variants classified as OxoG are removed.\r\n\r\n+ **Note on _strandbiasprop_ filter**  \r\nStrand bias is defined below [(Guo et al., 2012)](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-666) where a,c represent the forward and reverse strand allele counts of REF reads and b,d represent the forward and reverse strand allele counts of ALT reads.  The topmost proportion of biased variants is removed (e.g. suggested value is 0.1, leading to the top 10% variants with the highest strand bias being removed. Note that this is not the GATK strand bias, which is calculated differently. Note that this filter is available, but is *not* implemented in either of the default settings.  \r\nStrand bias: |b/(a+b)-d/(c+d)|/ ((b+d)/(a+b+c+d))  \r\nGATK strand bias: max(((b/(a+b))&ast;(c/(c+d)))/((a+c)/(a+b+c+d)),((d/(c+d))&ast;(a/(a+b)))/((a+c)/(a+b+c+d)))\r\n\r\n+ **Note on _strandbiassimple_ filter**  \r\nMaximum strand bias. This is defined very simply as the minimum proportion of reads in either direction. e.g. if there were 100 reads and only 1 were forward, strand bias would be 0.01.\r\nStrand bias: min(forward/(forward+reverse),reverse/(reverse+forward)) or min((a+b)/(a+b+c+d),(c+d)/(a+b+c+d))\r\n\r\n+ **Note on _SNVcluster50_ and _SNVcluster100_ filters**  \r\nMaximum number of SNVs in the input VCF in a 50 or 100 bp window centered on the current SNV.  SNVs must have at least 2 reads supporting them and a VAF>=5%.\r\n\r\n+ **Note on _repeats_ filter**  \r\nMaximum length of 1/2/3/4mers surrounding the SNV. Lengths must be factors of repeats e.g. n=8 would only consider 1/2/4mers because 3 is not a factor of 8.  Repeated regions frequently result in false positive variants.  When using this filter, a reference genome *must* be supplied so FiNGS can find the flanking sequences.\r\n\r"
