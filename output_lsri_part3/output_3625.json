AND make sure you have the latest version!\n- Don't mix up things: One commit for each bug fix / feature you want to introduce.\n- Keep it clean, example: Don't fix a typo but then change 10 more additional lines adding an 'space'.\n- Follow the plugin code style (yes, again... I been working on several opensource projects and people keep ignoring)\n- Run 'npm test' or 'grunt test' to check for syntax issues using JSHint\n- Commits must NOT INCLUDE any minified version"

        "value": "CoRINs is a web tool for comparing multiple residue interaction networks (RINs) that generates easy to understand results through interactive tables, graphics and downloable text files. CoRINs reports may be useful in the evaluation of protein conformational variation, as an additional tool to validate models from homology modeling, or to assess the putative impacts of a mutation on the protein structure and activity, by identifying its effects on the protein network. \nCoRINs does not construct RINs. To construct the Residue Interaction Networks (RINs) from PDB protein structure files, you need to use the [RING 2.0](https://protein.bio.unipd.it/ring/) program or webserver (Piovesan et al. 2016 - [PMID: 27198219](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27198219/)). For now, CoRINs only uses [RING 2.0](https://protein.bio.unipd.it/ring/) output files as input, but we pretend to expand this option soon. \nThe tool's central core uses Python language with high-performance libraries such as Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/), Numpy (https://numpy.org), and Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/). For the Web modules, CoRINs uses the frameworks Django (www.djangoproject.com/), Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/), and D3.js (https://d3js.org/). There is also a graph parameter generation module (betweenness and clustering coefficient) developed in the R language (https://www.r-project.org/) and using R package igraph (https://igraph.org), which calculates betweenness weighted and clustering coefficient.\n \n"
