        ],
        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "MIBI_GUI is a set of three graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for low-level analysis of MIBI data. The three steps of low-level analysis (after you've extracted your data) are background removal, denoising, and aggregate removal. Once you've downloaded or cloned this repository, all you need to do to use the GUI is to add the MIBI_GUI directory and all subdirectories to your MATLAB path. When doing low-level analysis of your MIBI data, you don't need to add your data to the MATLAB path, that's done inside of the GUI. If you clone this repository, you can get updates simply by navigating to the MIBI_GUI directory in terminal and typing 'git pull'.\n\nThe MIBI_GUI expects that your data will be structured in a certain way. You should have a directory structure that looks like this\n\n    your_data\n        panel\n        extracted\n            Point1\n            Point2\n            Point3\n            ...\n        no_background\n        no_noise\n        no_aggregates\n\nYour Points can be either folders or they can be multilayer tiffs, MIBI_GUI doesn't care. For best results, it's recommended that you include a folder called \"panel\" on the same level as your extracted (and other) folders. Inside of this panel folder, you should put your panel.csv file (you don't have to rename the file, it just has to be a csv). This way, MIBI_GUI can keep track of the mass-order of your labels, making the results of your analysis compatible with other scripts that expect mass-ordered labels. If you fail to include this csv file, or put it in the wrong place, MIBI_GUI will still load your data, but it will sort the channels alphabetically, possibly making the results of your analysis incompatible with other scripts that expect mass-sorted channels.\n\nIf your Points are folders, then MIBI_GUI expects that somewhere inside of this folder there are individual TIF files for each channel. You have to tell MIBI_GUI the internal structure of your Points so it knows how to find them. For instance, if your Point folders are organized like this...\n\n    Point#\n        TIFs\n            Au.tif\n            dsDNA.tif \n            CD45.tif\n            ...\n\nThen you should write just \"TIFs\" in pathext.txt (don't include the quotation marks). If your Point folders are organized like this...\n\n    Point#\n        extra_directory\n            TIFs\n                Au.tif\n                dsDNA.tif\n                CD45.tif\n                ...\n\nThen you should write \"extra_directory/TIFs\" in pathext.txt.\n\nAt each stage of low-level analysis, MIBI_GUI will write the results to an appropriate directory. So if you have your raw extracted data inside of \"my_data/extracted/\", then MIBI_GUI will write the background-removed data to \"my_data/no_background/\", the denoised data to \"my_data/no_noise\", and the aggregate-removed data to \"my_data/no_aggregates\". At each stage a log file will be saved inside of the respective folder to help you keep track of your work.\n\n"

Do this by clicking the \u201cAdd Point(s)\u201d button in the \u201cManage Points and Select Background Channel\u201d section, which opens a file navigator. Navigate to the folder that has your data, and select the points you want to remove the background from. Note that this can be either Point folders (as described above) or multilayer TIFFs.\nOnce we\u2019ve added the points, we need to select a channel to use for selecting background removal parameters. To do this, select from the dropdown menu the channel you want to use. This channel be treated as the \"background\" channel, and the selected point/channel pair will be automatically displayed. Note that MIBI_GUI by default plots over the current figure, if you want new figures to be generated each time you select a channel (or point), deselect the \"Reuse figure\" button. \nNow we can select background parameters in the \u201cBackground Removal Parameters\u201d section. There are three parameters for generating a mask, the Gaussian radius of the blur, the Threshold we cutoff at, and the Background Cap. Enter the parameters you want to test on the currently selected point and channel combination, and press the \u201cTest\u201d button (if you want you select other point-channel pairs, press \u201cLoad\u201d, and test the same parameters, or other parameters). The GUI will save a little history of what parameters you\u2019ve loaded, which you can manage using the \u201cDelete\u201d and \u201cReload\u201d buttons, which remove a selected set of parameters or loads the selected set of parameters for easy re-testing, respectively. When you press the \u201cTest\u201d button, an image of the generated mask and a histogram will be displayed. If you want a new figure to be generated each time you test, deselect the \"Reuse figure\" button in this section. \nIf we want we can evaluate our choice of background removal parameters on other point-channel combinations. To do so, look in the \u201cEvaluation Parameters\u201d section, and select the desired point from the \u201cPoint\u201d dropdown menu, as well as the desired channel from the \u201cChannel\u201d dropdown menu. We can choose the value to be removed from the channel as well as the evaluation cap in the \u201cRemove value\u201d and \u201cEvaluation Cap\u201d boxes, respectively. When you\u2019ve picked the parameters you want to evaluate, either click the \u201cEvaluate Point\u201d button to evaluate the desired parameters on the selected channel and point, displaying the before and after images for that channel and point, OR click the \u201cEvaluate All Points\u201d button to evaluate the desired parameters on the selected channel across ALL points, displaying the before and after for each point on the selected channel. As before, the GUI saves a history of your evaluation parameters, which can be managed with the \u201cDelete\u201d and \u201cReload\u201d buttons. \n"

Do this by clicking the \u201cAdd Point(s)\u201d button in the \u201cManage Points\u201d section, which opens a file navigator. Navigate to the folder that has your data, and select the points you want to denoise from. Note: these should be either Point folders or multi-layered TIFFs. \nOnce the Points have been loaded you will notice the large white box inside of the \u201cDenoising Parameters\u201d section populates with channel names and various numbers. This display indicates the currently chosen values for each channel (at the moment channels have the same values across all points). The slider marked \u201cThreshold\u201d can be used to change the nearest neighbor threshold for the selected channel, the threshold value can also be edited in the text box right next to the slider. You can change the range of values taken by the slider by clicking the \u201cThreshold\u201d button and modifying the minimum and maximum values. If you want to use a different k-val for the the nearest neighbor calculation, enter a different value in the \u201cK-val\u201d text box. You can easily switch between different channels by simply clicking on them, and if you want to look at channels on a different point, simply select the point under the \u201cManage Points\u201d section. \nTo actually view the results of denoising, we need to do a k-nearest neighbors calculation on each image. Select the Points and Channels (either by double-clicking or highlighting and pressing the \"Enter\" key on your keyboard) that you want to do the calculation for, then press the \"Run KNN\" button. Depending on how many points and which channels you picked, this could take a while. Once the calculation is done, you can navigate around the point-channel combinations you ran the calculation for and adjust the Threshold (using the sliding bar or the textbox right next to it) and the display cap (this is just for viewing purposes and does not effect denoising in any way). If you the boundaries of the sliding bars are not to your liking, just click the buttons right next to them with the name of the parameter they control and change the minimum and maximum values of the sliding bar. \nPoints and channels have four basic 'states', which you can think of as (1) unloaded and unselected (the default, pressing the \"Run KNN\" button will have no effect on these points/channels) which is indicated by a small dot, (2) unloaded but selected (what happens when you first select points/channels) which is indicated by an empty square, (3) loaded and selected (this is the state points/channels enter after they have been selected AND the KNN calculation has been done, meaning that you can look at the results of the KNN calculation by simply clicking on the appropriate point/channel) which is indicated by a solid square, and (4) loaded and unselected (this state means that next time the \"Run KNN\" button is pushed, the results of the previous knn-calculation at these points/channels will be flushed and no new knn calculation will be run for these specific points/channels, essentially \"clearing\" them). Channels have an additional state which means \"Don't denoise me\" and can be accessed by selecting the desired channel and pressing the delete key. To leave this state, just press enter (you may have to press enter again to reach the actual state you want, but this is visually indicated to make things easy). \nWhatever combination of point/channel is highlighted will be displayed on the screen. If you want to use a different k-val for the KNN calculation, simply select the channel you want to change the value for and enter the new value in the textbox labeled \"K-val\". When you click \"Run KNN\" again, the calculation will be updated to use this value. \nIf you decide you want to continue working later on denoising, you can click the \u201cSave Run\u201d button at the bottom of the GUI, which will prompt you to pick a folder location and file name to save your work. This will save the relevant information into a .mat file, which you can later open by clicking the \u201cLoad Run\u201d button. Once you are satisfied with the denoising parameters you have selected, click the \u201cDenoise\u201d button. This will open a file navigator window which allows you to select the folder in which the log for this session will be saved. The log files contains information about the parameters you used for denoising. The denoising parameters will be applied to the points you loaded, and the results will be saved into a folder called \u201cno_noise\u201d, parallel to the folder you\u2019re points are in. \n"

These parameters (\u201cThreshold\u201d, \u201cRadius\u201d, and \u201cCap\u201d) can be modified with their respective sliders or text boxes.
