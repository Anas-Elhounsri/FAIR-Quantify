To run RECOGNICER, please first set the configuration parameters in `RECOGNICER.sh`, including a customized sample name `SAMPLE` (default: Sample), species/genome version `SPECIES` (default: hg18), and output directory `OUT_DIR`. Then use the command\n\n`sh RECOGNICER.sh ChIP.bed control.bed 0.01`\n\nThe 3 input arguments are ChIP data file, control data file, and FDR threshold. The whole process may take several hours. \n\nAlthough not required, you can also tune the following parameters as you like:\n- `WINDOW_SIZE`: Resolution of the RECOGNICER result, in bp. default: 200 (mononucleosome+linker).\n- `FRAGMENT_SIZE`: ChIP DNA fragment size, used for determination of the shift size from the 5' start location of a sequence read towards the center of the DNA fragment represented by the read. default: 150 (mononucleosome).\n- `GENOME_FRACTION`: Effective mappable fraction of the whole genome, dependent on the read length. default: 0.74 for the human genome.\n- `CHIPTHRESHOLD`: Number of copies of identical reads allowed in a dataset. default: 1.\n\nIt is strongly NOT recommended to change other parameters.\n\n**Caution**: please do not run multiple instances of RECOGNICER scripts originated from the same directory in parallel. Each instance of RECOGNICER script generates temporary files with hard-coded names. If multiple instances of RECOGNICER scripts originated from the same directory are run in parallel, their temporary files would interfere with each other, resulting in absurd outcomes. If you need to run multiple instances of RECOGNICER simultaneously, please make sure to run them under separate directories to avoid interference.\n\n"
