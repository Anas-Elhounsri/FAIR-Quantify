These traits are controlled by three\npleiotropic (`pleio = 3`) additive and dominance QTNs\n(`same_add_dom_QTN = TRUE` and `degree_of_dom = 1`); two pleiotropic\nepistatic QTNs (`pleio_e = 2`); four, ten and one trait-specific\nadditive and dominance QTNs (`trait_spec_a_QTN_num = c(4, 10, 1)`); and\ntwo, one and five epistatic trait-specific epistatic QTNs\n(`trait_spec_e_QTN_num = c(2, 1, 5)`). In addition to the default\nparameters, each genetic architecture may be simulated with many\nauxiliary features. For instance, we may be interested in outputting the\namount of variance explained by each simulated QTN\n(`QTN_variance = TRUE`) or setting a residual correlation between traits\n(`cor_res = residual`) and thus, change the default option of\nindependent residuals. Notice that in this example, the heritability is\na 2x3 matrix (`h2 = heritability`). Each column of the matrix\n\u201cheritability\u201d will be assigned to a different trait. In this case,\nsimplePHENOTYPES will loop over each row of `h2`, keeping all other\nvariables constant. Since rep = 5 and nrow(h2) = 2, ten experiments will\nbe simulated and saved in separate files. Simulated results will be\nsaved as \u201c.fam\u201d files used as GEMMA input. Simultaneously, one genotypic\nfile without the QTNs for the simulated traits will be saved for each\nreplication. Due to the option `vary_QTN = TRUE`, each experiment will\nbe simulated with different QTNs; thus, if we opt for\n`remove_QTN = TRUE`, many potentially large files will be saved in the\noutput\\_dir folder. By default, simplePHENOTYPES will ask us if all\nthese files should be saved. To avoid this question, we may use\n`warning_file_saver = FALSE`. In the present example, ten plink bed\nfiles (which is also the input for GEMMA) are saved. Genotypic files for\nrep one will be named `SNP55K_maize282_maf04_noQTN_rep_1.bed`,\n`SNP55K_maize282_maf04_noQTN_rep_1.bim`, and\n`SNP55K_maize282_maf04_noQTN_rep_1.fam`, whereas the phenotypic file\nwill be saved as `Simulated_Data__Rep1_Herit_0.2_0.8_0.7.fam`.\nImportantly, the file `SNP55K_maize282_maf04_noQTN_rep_1.fam` does not\ncontain the phenotypic data and needs to be replaced by\n`Simulated_Data__Rep1_Herit_0.2_0.8_0.7.fam` prior to its use by GEMMA\nor other software that uses bed files.
