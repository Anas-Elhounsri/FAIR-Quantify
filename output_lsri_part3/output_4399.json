Calculates the porosity via two-body overlaps of spheres.\n* GPA : Grid point approach. Void and accessible porosity are calculated using a grid in the unit cell.\n* PSD : Pore size distribution. Using a Monte-Carlo scheme, the pore size distribution is calculated.\n\nTo run the code, go to the *examples* folder.     \nThe file run_porE.py contains examples for the execution on the non-GUI level.    \nThe file run_GUI.py will execute the graphical user interface, including the OSA, GPA and PSD functionalities.     \nThe HEA will be implemented soon.\n\nSpecial thanks goes to Sebastian Schwalbe for writing the GUI and for many other useful discussions.\n"
