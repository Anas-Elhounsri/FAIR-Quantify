Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series\nof actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or\npermanent ban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within\nthe community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0, available at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.\n\n## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests\n\nWe welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.\n\nWhen filing an issue, please check existing open and closed issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. We have added issue template that will guide you with details expected from an issue.\n\n## How do I make a contribution?\nNever made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here's a quick rundown!\n\n1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.\n2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under `your-GitHub-username/repository-name`.\n3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.\n4. Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.\n5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.\n6. Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to the \"snapshot\" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.\n7. Use `git commit -m \"Insert a short message of the changes made here\"` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.\n8. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin branch-name-here`.\n9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.\n10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so \"Added more log outputting to resolve #4352\".\n11. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!\n12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.\n13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.\n14. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!\n\n## Finding contributions to work on\n\nLooking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on.\nAs our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issues is a great place to start.\n\n### Running tests  \n  \nPlease check the tests by running them with:\n```\npython -m unittest\n```"

Here, we provide an open source utility for converting variants from VCF format into HL7 FHIR Genomics format. Details of the translation logic are on the [manual page](docs/Manual.md). Additional information and case studies are described in our [BMC Bioinformatics article](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-021-04039-1).
