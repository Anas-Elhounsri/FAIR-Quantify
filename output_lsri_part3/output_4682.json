        "value": "``SBMLLint`` is a collection of tools for linting reactions. The initial focus is detecting mass balance errors. The tool takes as input a model expressed in either SBML ([Systems Biology Markup Language](http://sbml.org/Main_Pagemodeller), a standard format for biochemical models) or the [Antimony language](http://antimony.sourceforge.net/) (a human readable representation of chemical reaction models). \n``SBMLLint`` implements two algorithms for detecting mass balance errors. The first, **moiety analysis**, checks for balance in\nthe moiety structure of reactions.\nFor example ``ATP`` has the moeities adenosine with three inorganic phosphates.\nMoiety analysis requires that modelers follow a naming convention that exposes the moiety structure.\nThere is no restriction on the choice of moiety names (other than compliance with SBML naming standards).\nMoiety names can be exposed in two ways. The first is by using a naming convention.\nFor example, the modeler could use ``A`` to indicate a adenosine moiety and ``Pi`` for inorganic phosphate.\nMoiety analysis requires that moieties be separated by an underscore (``\\_``).\nThat is, ``ATP`` would be written as ``A_Pi_Pi_Pi``\nSimilarly, ``GluP`` would be written as ``Glu_Pi``. Thus, the above reaction is \nwritten as ``Glu + A_Pi_Pi_Pi -> Glu_Pi + A_Pi_Pi``.\nA second way to expose moiety names is through explicit declarations in a configuration file. An example of this is\n```\nATP:\n- A, 1\n- Pi, 3\n```\nWe provide a tool to partially automate the construction of these explicit declarations (BASH2*).\n \nMoiety analysis checks that the count of each moiety in the reactants is the same as the count of each moiety in the products.\nAlthough moiety analysis places a burden on the modeler to use the underscore convention,\nwe note that about 20% of the models in the [BioModels](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) repository already use names that are close\nto this structured. \nThe second algorithm, **GAMES** (Graphical Analysis with Mass Equality Sets) does not impose any requirements on\nthe structure of the molecule names.\nGAMES checks for *stoichiometric inconsistency*, which is a weaker condition\nthan mass balance.\nA collection of reactions is stoichiometrically inconsistent if the set of reactions infers that a molecule has a mass of zero. To illustrate this, consider a model consisting of two reactions: ``A -> B`` and ``A -> B + C``. The first reaction implies that the mass of ``A`` is the same as ``B``. The second reaction implies that the mass of ``A`` equals the sum of the masses and ``B`` and ``C``. Both statements can be true only if the mass of ``C`` is zero, and so the model has a stoichiometric inconsistency.\n \n"

        "value": "Many biological models are based on chemical reactions. For example, glycolysis, arguably the most widely exercised metabolic pathway in biology, begins by transforming the reactants glucosue (Glu) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the products glucose 6-phosphate (GluP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), or: ``Glu + ATP -> GluP + ADP``. Examples of biological modeling techniques that rely on reactions include flux balance analysis and kinetics models.\n\nToday's biological models typically consist of tens to hundreds of reactions. Even with this modest level of complexity, it is easy to make mistakes. For example, a **mass balance error** occurs if the total mass of the reactants differs from the total mass of the products. With the advent of high throughput laboratory techniques, the complexity of models will grow rapidly. As a point of comparison, the complexity of typical software packages has grown from hundereds of lines of code in the 1960s to tens of millions of lines of code for software such as linux and the Apache web server.\n\nBecause of this huge growth in the complexity, software engineers developed sophisticated tools to detect errors in codes *statically*, before any statement is executed. For example, the ``pylint`` tool analyzes ``python`` source codes to determine if a variable is referenced before a value is assigned to it. The term **linter** is used for a tool that does static analysis of source codes.\n"
