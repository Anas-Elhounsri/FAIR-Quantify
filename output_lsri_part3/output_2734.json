Please be patient! This is a one-time cost when building a tree with a new raw file. Subsequent file loads are very fast once an mzTree file is built.\n"

        "value": "- *Isotopic Trace Mode.* When a user enters isotopic trace mode, they are given the option to create a new trace or select an existing trace to edit. Each time a new trace is created, the trace is given an ID and color. Users select the points belonging to the trace by clicking and dragging a rectangle over the desired points to highlight them in the given color. The same procedure is used to edit an existing trace, only the control key is depressed while drawing the rectangle.\n\n- *Isotopic Envelope Mode.* After the user has identified isotopic traces, they can group them together with isotopic envelope mode. Similar to isotopic trace mode, this mode creates a new envelope ID and color for each new envelope created. The user then selects all isotopic traces that belong to the same group. Isotopic traces can be grouped by clicking each trace or simply by dragging a line across all traces in an envelope. To help the user distinguish which isotopic traces belong together, the ruler tool shows m/z intervals corresponding to specific charge states. The ruler will appear wherever the mouse is placed when users select a number from the keypad. The ruler moves with the graph as the user zooms or pans, and will remain present until the user hits the tilde key. The m/z distance displayed is 1/z, where z is the number selected and the charge state of a hypothetical compound at the given mass. Users can also toggle between 2-D and 3-D mode while in either isotopic trace or isotopic envelope mode to ensure peak alignment. Isotopic traces can be added to existing isotopic envelopes at any time following this procedure and they can be removed in the same way while depressing the control key.\n\n- *Mark as Noise Button.* When all distinguishable points in the current view have been annotated the user can mark all other points in the view as noise. When a point is marked as noise it will be colored gray in the view and given an ID of -1 when exported to .csv. To prevent users from marking unseen points as noise, the graph view must be displaying a number of points below the point threshold to ensure that the user is viewing every point within the (m/z, RT) coordinates and none are hidden.\n"
