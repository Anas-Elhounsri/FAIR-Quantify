The implemented wavelet-based methods aim to   \n1. test for genetic association of functional phenotype\n2. provide explanations for observed associations such as which parts and features of the data are driving the association\n3. make applications to large-scale genetic association analyses computationally tractable. \nAlthough wavelet methods were motivated primarily by genetic association studies for high-throughput sequencing data, they could also test for association between functional data and\nother covariates, either continuous or discrete. For example, in a genomics context, it could be used to detect differences in gene expression (from RNA-seq data) or TF binding (from ChIP-seq data) measured on two groups (e.g. treatment conditions or cell types). Or it could be used to associate a functional phenotype, such as chromatin accessibility, with a continuous covariate, such as overall expression of a gene. It could also be used for genome-wide association studies of functional phenotypes unrelated to sequencing.\n  \n"
