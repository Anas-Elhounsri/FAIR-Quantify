        "value": "Several people contributed to the building of `mlr3proba`. Firstly,\nthanks to Michel Lang for writing `mlr3survival`. Several learners and\nmeasures implemented in `mlr3proba`, as well as the prediction, task,\nand measure surv objects, were written initially in `mlr3survival`\nbefore being absorbed into `mlr3proba`. Secondly thanks to Franz Kiraly\nfor major contributions towards the design of the proba-specific parts\nof the package, including compositors and predict types. Also for\nmathematical contributions towards the scoring rules implemented in the\npackage. Finally thanks to Bernd Bischl and the rest of the mlr core\nteam for building `mlr3` and for many conversations about the design of\n`mlr3proba`.\n"

Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

This streamlines the interface but unfortunately means ids can no longer be set dynamically.\r\n* Add parameters `t_max` and `p_max` to Graf, Schmid and Integrated Log-loss as an alternative to `times`. `t_max` is equivalent to `times = seq(t_max)` and `p_max` is the proportion of censoring to integrate up to in the dataset.\r\n* Fix bug in Rcpp code that was causing erroneous values for calculating the cindex in datasets greater than 20,000 observations.\r\n",

        "description": "* Deprecated measures from 0.2.0 have now been deleted.\r\n* IPCW measures such as `surv.graf`, `surv.schmid`, and `surv.intlogloss` now allow training data to be passed to the score function with `task` and `train_set` to allow the censoring distribution to be estimated on the training data. This is automatically applied for resample and benchmark results.\r\n* IPCW measures such as `surv.graf`, `surv.schmid`, and `surv.intlogloss` now include a parameter `proper` to determine what weighting scheme should be applied by the estimated censoring distribution, The current method (Graf, 1999) `proper = FALSE`, weights observations either by their event time or 'current' time depending if they're dead or not, the new method `proper = TRUE` weights observations by event time. The `proper = TRUE` method is strictly proper when censoring and survival times are independent and G is estimated on large enough data. The `proper = FALSE` method is never proper. The default is currently `proper = FALSE` to enable backward compatibility, this will be changed to `proper = TRUE` in v0.6.0.\r\n* The `rm_cens` parameter in `surv.logloss` has been deprecated in favour of `IPCW`. `rm_cens` will be removed in v0.6.0. If `rm_cens` or `IPCW` are `TRUE` then censored observations are removed and the score is weighted by an estimate of the censoring distribution at individual event times. Otherwise if `rm_cens` and `IPCW` are `FALSE` then no deletion or weighting takes place. The `IPCW = TRUE` method is strictly proper when censoring and survival times are independent and G is estimated on large enough data. The `ipcw = FALSE` method is never proper. \r\n* Add `surv.dcalib` for the D-Calibration measure from Haider et al. (2020).",

Generalises all c-index measures with a fast C++ implementation\r\n* Akritas estimator added to [mlr3learners.proba repo](https://www.github.com/mlr3learners/mlr3learners.proba)\r\n* Added scoring rule `MeasureSurvSchmid`\r\n* Addd calibration measures `MeasureSurvCalibrationBeta` and `MeasureSurvCalibrationAlpha`\r\n* `surv.brier` alias added for `surv.graf`\r\n* `response` parameter added to `PipeOpCrankCompositor` and `crankcompositor` to now optionally fill `response` predict type with same values as `crank`\r\n* Added `PipeOpProbregrCompostior` and `compose_probregr` for composition to `distr` return type from (a) regression learner(s) predicting `response` and `se`\r\n* Added `PipeOpSurvAvg` and `surv_averager` pipeline for weighted model averaging of distr, lp, crank, and response predictions.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated Functionality\r\n\r\n* The following measures are deprecated use `MeasureSurvCindex` instead with following parameters: `MeasureSurvBeggC`, use defaults; `MeasureSurvHarrellC`, use defaults; `MeasureSurvUnoC`, use `weight_meth = 'G/2'`; `MeasureSurvGonenC`, use `weight_method = 'GH'`\r\n* `MeasureSurvGrafSE`, `MeasureSurvLoglossSE`, `MeasureSurvIntLoglossSE`, `MeasureSurvRMSESE`, `MeasureSurvMSESE`, and `MeasureSurvMAESE` all deprecated and will be deleted in v0.4.0. Use `msr(\"surv.graf\", se = TRUE)` instead (for example).\r\n* Measures renamed such that `surv.nagelkR2` is now `surv.nagelk_r2`, analogously for all R2, AUC, TPR, and TNR measures. Old constructors will be deleted in v0.4.0.\r\n* Renamed `distrcompose` and `crankcompose` to `distr_compose` and `crank_compose`. Old ids will be deleted in v0.4.0.\r\n\r\n### Edited Functionality\r\n\r\n* Measures renamed such that `surv.nagelkR2` is now `surv.nagelk_r2`, analogously for all R2, AUC, TPR, and TNR measures. Old constructors will be deleted in v0.4.0.\r\n* `MeasureSurvGraf` and `MeasureSurvIntLogloss` now have much faster C++ implementation\r\n\r\n### Moved Functionality\r\n\r\n- `LearnerSurvGlmnet`, `LearnerSurvCVGlmnet`, `LearnerSurvXgboost` and `LearnerSurvRanger` have been moved to the [mlr3learners repo](https://www.github.com/mlr-org/mlr3learners)\r\n\r\n- `LearnerSurvGBM` has been moved to https://www.github.com/mlr3learners/mlr3learners.gbm\r\n\r\n- `LearnerSurvMboost`, `LearnerSurvGlmBoost`, `LearnerSurvGamboost`, `LearnerSurvBlackboost` have been moved to https://www.github.com/mlr3learners/mlr3learners.mboost\r\n",
