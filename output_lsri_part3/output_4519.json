This should be considered together with the number of migration, comigration and source count and the probabilities assigned to each inferred migration graph. The probability value will also indicate the number of migration graphs generated. The migration graph with the lowest number of migration, comigration and source count and the highest probability value is the most likely migration history. For example, if we observe probability= .8, then one or a few migration graphs will be predicted. Therefore:\n\t1) If Probability > .5 (high), we expect the rest of the migration graphs to have lower probabilities. \n\t2) If Probability < .5 (low), we expect a certain ambiguity to arise in pathways. We recommend the user to be cautious and examine any migration inferences that result into equal number of migration, comigration and source count with almost similar probabilities values.\u2003 \n"

To use PathFinder, the following python packages need to be installed.\n\n\tPython 3\n\tmatplotlib\n\tpydot\n\tgraphviz\n\tnetworkx (<=2.8)\n\tbiopython\n\nIf networkx version is higher than 2.8, PathFinder will not work. In this case, please try fully uninstalling your networkx package from python, and then reinstalling version 2.8 of the networkx package. If you're using pip, that should just mean \"pip uninstall networkx\" and then \"pip install networkx==2.8\". If it tells you that version isn't available, just do \"pip install networkx==\" and it will list the available versions, then pick the latest version available that's less than 2.8.\n\nAdditionally, PathFinder uses MEGA-CC. MEGA-CC can be downloaded for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux from (http://www.megasoftware.net).\n\nLastly, to generate visualizations, PathFinder relies on the graphviz dot executable, so the Graphviz software needs to be installed and the dot.exe file placed in the system PATH variable in order for PathFinder to produce visualizations.\n\n"

In these cases, the \u2013-relax_threshold flag may be added to ignore the minimum threshold only for those nodes, causing the program to select the anatomical site(s) with the highest probability irrespective of the minimum threshold value.\n \n"
