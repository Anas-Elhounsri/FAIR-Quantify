        "value": "Each record in the database describes a snake specimen eating or\nattempting to eat a prey specimen. Note that due to the nature of\nthe published data a \"specimen\" does not necessarily correspond to\na single individual. In all cases, however, a specimen refers to a\nset of individuals that belong to the same taxon. The following\nfields are associated with each record: \n    The Linnean rank of the predator. Typically this\n    will be \"species\" or \"infraspecies\". \n- predator_taxon \n    \n    A semicolon separated list of the higher taxonomic\n    names that apply to the predator. \n    The number of individual predator organisms\n    involved in the interaction. \n    A unique identifier for the specimen that is\n    either (1) a bona fide museum voucher number or (2) a\n    randomly generated alphanumeric code. The rationale for this\n    field is that same predator specimen may have eaten multiple\n    prey specimens that carry unique identifying information\n    (e.g. taxonomic identities, distinct ages, etc.), in which\n    case each prey specimen requires its own row, thus\n    necessitating duplication of the predator specimen across\n    rows. Having a unique identifier for the predator specimen\n    allows one to identify the same predator specimen appearing\n    in multiple rows, although this rarely happens due to the\n    tendency of snakes to only have a single prey item in their\n    gut. A caveat needs to be mentioned. In many cases, the\n    results of museum studies are reported in summarized tabular\n    form. For example, a museum study of snake X may report that\n    12 specimens had eaten 14 individuals of prey Y and that 8\n    specimens had eaten 8 individuals of prey Z. These data will\n    be represented in SquamataBase as two rows, and each row will\n    have a unique randomly generated predator_voucher. This is\n    because there is no way, without further information, to know\n    whether any of the individuals eating prey Y also ate prey Z. \n    The sex of the specimen. Typically only used when the\n    predator_count field is 1. \n    The age of the specimen.Typically only used when the\n    predator_count field is 1. \n    The snout-vent-length (in mm) of the specimen.\n    Typically only used when the predator_count field is 1. \n    The total length (in mm) of the specimen. Typically\n    only used when the predator_count field is 1. \n    The mass (in grams) of the specimen. Typically only\n    used when the predator_count field is 1. \nAll of the above fields with the exception of the svl field\nare also recorded for the prey specimen, and hence take the\nprefix \"prey\". Additionally, the following field is unique to\nthe prey specimen: \n    YYYY-MM-DD formatted date when the predation event was\n    observed. If the observation resulted from an examination of\n    gut contents this field is the collection date of the\n    specimen. \n    HH:MM formatted time when the predation event ended,\n    measured on a 24 hour clock to avoid AM and PM designations. \n    If the predation event was successful this field\n    takes the value \"prey_eaten\". This is always the case if the\n    observation is based on dissections of museum specimens.\n    However, for observations based on encounters with snakes in\n    the field other outcomes are possible and the values in this\n    field are self-explanatory (e.g.\n    \"predation_interrupted_by_observer\"). \n    Habitat description in the words of the\n    original authors. \n"
