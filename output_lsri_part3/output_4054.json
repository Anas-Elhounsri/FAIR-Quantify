Inside, you will find two output files :\n- a `scaffolds.fasta` containing the new scaffolds \n- a `scaffolds.agp` file containing the changes made to contigs\n\nIf you would like to change the name/path of the output directory, you can do so with the `--output` argument.\n"

This argument is useful (and recommended) to ensure that no mapping has been missed inside one of the individual XMAP file. Usually, this file's name looks like this: `*.cut_CTTAAG_GCTCTTC_0kb_0labels_NGS_contigs_HYBRID_Export.xmap_sorted.xmap`.\n- `--only-confirmed-pos` argument is used so that only mappings contained in the `--xmap-2enz` file are retained. Indeed, by using one XMAP file per enzyme, contigs can be placed two times in the final assembly. This ensures that contigs are only placed one time and that created scaffolds are validated by both enzymes.\n- `--aggressive` enables the sequence similarity scaffolding. In a first phase, BiSCoT will search similarities between contigs based on label mappings. If this parameter is set, BiSCoT will search for sequence similarity to close gaps created by the first step.\n"
