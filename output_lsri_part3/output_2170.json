        "value": "MashMap implements a fast and approximate algorithm for computing local alignment boundaries between long DNA sequences. It can be useful for mapping genome assembly or long reads (PacBio/ONT) to reference genome(s). Given a minimum alignment length and an identity threshold for the desired local alignments, Mashmap computes alignment boundaries and identity estimates using *k*-mers. It does not compute the alignments explicitly, but rather estimates an unbiased *k*-mer based [Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) using a combination of [minmers](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.16.540882v1) (a novel winnowing scheme) and [MinHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash). This is then converted to an estimate of sequence identity using the [Mash](http://mash.readthedocs.org) distance. An appropriate *k*-mer sampling rate is automatically determined using the given minimum local alignment length and identity thresholds.  \nAs an example, Mashmap can map a human genome assembly to the human reference genome in about one minute total execution time and < 4 GB memory using just 8 CPU threads, achieving more than an order of magnitude improvement in both runtime and memory over alternative methods. We describe the algorithms associated with Mashmap, and report on speed, scalability, and accuracy of the software in the publications listed [below](#publications). Unlike traditional mappers, MashMap does not compute exact sequence alignments. In future, we plan to add an optional alignment support to generate base-to-base alignments.\n \n"

        "type": "Text_excerpt",
        "value": "For most of the use cases, default values should be appropriate. However, different parameters and their purpose can be checked using the help page `mashmap -h`. Important ones are mentioned below: \n* Identity threshold (`--perc_identity`, `--pi`) : By default, it is set to 85, implying mappings with 85% or more identity should be reported. For example, it can be set to 80% to account for more noisy long-read datasets or 95% for mapping human genome assembly to human reference. \n* Minimum segment length (`-s`, `--segLength`) :  Default is 5,000 bp. Sequences below this length are ignored. Mashmap provides guarantees on reporting local alignments of length twice this value. \n* Filtering options (`-f`, `--filter_mode`) : Mashmap implements a [plane-sweep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm) based algorithm to perform the alignment filtering. Similar to [delta-filter](http://mummer.sourceforge.net/manual/#filter) in nucmer, different filtering options are provided that are suitable for long read or assembly mapping. Option `-f map` is suitable for reporting the best mappings for long reads, whereas `-f one-to-one` is suitable for reporting orthologous mappings among all computed assembly to genome mappings.    \n* Sketch size (`-J`, `--sketchSize`) : This parameter sets the seed density of the winnowing scheme, gauranteeing that the minhash will be calculated from a sample of `sketchSize` k-mers for each segment. It is set automatically based on `--pi` but can be manually set as well.  \n* Dense sketching (`--dense`) : This flag will increase the seed density substantially, resulting in a density of roughly `0.02 * (1 + (1 - pi) / .05)` where `pi` is the `perc_identity` threshold. This leads to longer runtimes and higher RAM usage, but significantly more accurate estimates of ANI. \n \n"

In cases where users are mapping multiple query genomes to one or more target sequences with the `--skipPrefix #` flag, the one-to-one filter would treat all query sequences as part of the same genome/group.\r\n\r\nThis patch makes it so that the one-to-one plane-sweep filter is applied to each pair of query and reference groups independently, ensuring that `-n` mappings are retained for each pair.

        "description": "# MashMap3 Changelog\r\n* Instead of indexing locations of minimizers, we track indexing of windows for which a k-mer is one of the lowest `s` hashes in the window where `s` is the sketch size. These k-mers are termed \"minmers.\" \r\n* The first-pass filtering stage computes the number of shared minmers for each candidate mapping in linear time. Regions with significantly high counts of shared minmers are passed on to stage 2. \r\n* The second stage of filtering, where the minhash score of each mapping in the candidate region is calculated, uses a `std::vector` to keep track of the rolling minhash score as opposed to the `std::map` used in MashMap2. The details can be seen in [`slidingMap.hpp`](https://github.com/bkille/MashMap/blob/mashmap3/src/map/include/slidingMap.hpp). \r\n* While the mapping stage is faster, particularly for lower ANI cutoffs (90% and below), the indexing stage does require a bit more time than before. To avoid spending time recomputing the index, users can save the index via `--saveIndex PREFIX`, and then reuse it in a later run with `--loadIndex PREFIX`. \r\n* The default parameter for the sketch size depends on the value of the minimum ANI threshold (`pi`) and the segment length (`L`). Decreasing the sketch size will decrease runtime in a linear fashion at the cost of increasing the variance in the ANI estimation error. \r\n* Frequent seeds are filtered out based on how many minmer-intervals they have as opposed to how many times the kmer actually occurs in the reference. This adds some noise to frequent-kmer filtering, as its possible for a less frequent kmer to have more intervals than a more frequent kmer. \r\n\r\n* The binomial model is used to estimate ANI from Jaccard instead of the Poisson model.\r\n* k-mer size is no longer limited to `<=16`, as the hash values are 64 bits instead of 32 bits. The default kmer size is now `19`.\r\n* Numerous interface updates were copied over from [`wfmash`](https://github.com/waveygang/wfmash), including a progress meter and usage of the samtools `.fai` index. \r\n* The output of MashMap3 is now in [PAF](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md) format, with `id` and `jc` tags which represent the estimated ANI and the estimated Jaccard similarity, respectively. The `jc` tag is only present for mappings where chaining is disabled.\r\n\r\n* There is now an option for significantly denser sketching, `--dense` \r\n",
