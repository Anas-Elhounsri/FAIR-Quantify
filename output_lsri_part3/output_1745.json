Introduction\n---\nWhen it comes to the co-expressed gene module detection, its typical challenges consist of overlap between identified modules and local co-expression in a subset of biological samples. Recent studies have reported that the decomposition methods are the most appropriate for solving these challenges. In this study, we represent an R tool, termed Overlapping CoExpressed gene Module (oCEM), which possesses those methods with a wholly automatic analysis framework to help non-technical users to easily perform complicated statistical analyses and then gain robust results. We also develop a novel auxiliary statistical approach to select the optimal number of principal components using a permutation procedure. Three example datasets are used, related to human breast cancer, mouse metabolic syndrome, and E.coli gene expression compendium, to enable the illustration of the straightforward use of the tool. Computational experiment results show that oCEM outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in the ability to detect biologically relevant modules additionally. \n#### II. Understanding the tool and Data Structure\n---\nThe following are parameters included in overlapCEM and their role:\n- data: a data frame or matrix. `data` has its rows are samples and its columns are genes. \n- clinical: a data frame or matrix. Input data serve to perform Pearson's correlations between each identified module and each clinical feature. It includes its rows are samples, and its columns are clinical features of your choice. \n- standardize: logical. If your `data` are not standardized, just feed `T` or `TRUE` to this parameter. Default value is `T`. \n- method: string. Post-processing methods. Allowed values are `ICA-FDR`, `ICA-Zscore`, or `IPCA-FDR`. Default value is `ICA-Zscore`. \n- cex.text: numeric. Change the font size of texts in cells of the heatmap showing correlations between each identified module and each clinical feature. Default value is 0.7. \nPlease download datasets [data_n_code](https://github.com/huynguyen250896/oCEM/tree/main/data_n_code) and read [Additional File 1](https://github.com/huynguyen250896/oCEM/blob/main/Additional%20File%201.pdf) (highly recommended) as examples to well grasp oCEM's easy-to-meet format and its usage. \n#### III. Pipeline\n---\n![Figure](https://imgur.com/lPoY1UX.png)\n**Figure:** Pipeline of the package oCEM. \n#### V. What's new\n---\n- 2023-10-13: I made a bad decision that required the users to input both the mRNA and clinical data into `overlapCEM` to be able to run the tool successfully. Now, I made the input clinical data optional, meaning that the mRNA data is the only data for the tool to run. Besides, I refactored the codes comprehensively that would make them readable more (and hope that it runs more rapidly also!). Besides, default value to `optimizeCOM`'s `method` parameter set to `ICA-Zscore` makes both life scientists and bioinformatics scientists not confused about what to select and serves to compare the performance of oCEM with that of other tools. This decision was based on the results of a wonderful paper [[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03424-4)].\n- 2023-10-08: Users now can set the number of cores to the `optimizeCOM` algorithm on their own using its new argument `cores`, meaning that they can parallely perform the algorithm and get the optimal number of PCs more rapidly . Unfortunately, this feature is not available to Window users this time! \n#### VI.
