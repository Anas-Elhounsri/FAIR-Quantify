A. Edera, I. Small, D. H. Milone, and\nM. V. Sanchez-Puerta. [Download PDF](https://sinc.unl.edu.ar/sinc-publications/2021/ESSM21/sinc_ESSM21.pdf). \nIn land plants, the editosome is a highly sophisticated molecular machine able\nto convert post-transcriptionally cytidines into uridines (C-to-U) at highly\nspecific RNA positions called editing sites. This RNA editing seems to be partially governed by\n_cis_ elements, which still remain recalcitrant to characterization. \nDeepred-Mt is a novel neural network able to predict C-to-U editing sites in\nangiosperm mitochondria. Given an RNA sequence, consisting of a central\ncytidine flanked by 20 nucleotides on each side, Deepred-Mt scores how\nprobable its editing is. \nThe score is computed from complex _cis_ elements or motifs automatically\nextracted from the flanking bases by a multi-layer convolutional neural\nnetwork, whose full architecture is schematically shown below. \n"
