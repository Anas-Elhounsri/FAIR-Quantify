If you have a Windows computer, you can follow\n[these instructions](https://github.com/CaronLab/MhcVizPipe/wiki/Windows-installation) to install it using the\nWindows Subsystem for Linux.\n\nThere are two ways to install MhcVizPipe:\n\n1. From the [releases section](https://github.com/CaronLab/MhcVizPipe/releases), download a standalone package \n   which contains Python and all the required Python packages. The only additional steps \n   you need to perform are to download GibbsCluster, NetMHCpan and NetMHCIIpan and extract them into a directory called \n   \"tools\" inside the MhcVizPipe directory. This option is completely portable, e.g. you could move the program onto \n   a USB stick and use it on any compatible system (note that using a USB doesn't currently work in Windows).\n   - Because of system dependencies of the standalone Python distribution we are using, we cannot guarantee \n    the portable package will work on every computer. However, we have tested in Ubuntu 16.04-20.04, LinuxMint 18, \n      several versions of Mac OSX (High Sierra and greater) and using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, and generally \n      have had no issues. If you encounter problems, please try option 2 below.\n2. Install MhcVizPipe into an existing Python environment using `pip install MhcVizPipe` and configure \n   the settings to point to existing installations of GibbsCluster, NetMHCpan and netMHCIIpan.\n   - This requires an existing Python installation on your system.\n   \nFor complete installation instructions, [visit the wiki](https://github.com/CaronLab/MhcVizPipe/wiki).\n"

The copy the NetMHCpan, NetMHCIIpan and GibbsCluster folders (downloaded from DTU Health Tech https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/software.php) into the MhcVizPipe/tools folder. When you run MhcVizPipe for the first time it will download some data files which are required for NetMHCpan and NetMHCIIpan. If something goes wrong with the automatic downloads, either follow the instructions in the error message or in the NetMHCpan and NetMHCIIpan readme files for acquiring the data files.",
