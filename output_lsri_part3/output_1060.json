AutoCAT acts as a bridge to connect GIANA and DeepCAT. \nAutoCAT is written in Python3 and requires the following dependencies to be installed: \nAfter installing these dependencies, please download the AutoCAT repository, which includes sample data as well as ```GIANA4.py```, the associated TRBV allele data BASH2*, and BASH3*.

Lastly, we evaluated our selection for cluster purity using TCR classification error, or the percentage of healthy control sequences classified as cancer.

        "value": "|Function|Description|\n|-----------|-----------|\n|```runAutoCAT(inputDIR, userSize=None, userPurity=None)```| Runs the full AutoCAT pipeline. AutoCAT requires a directory with data files divided into two subdirectories, ```\u201cCancer\u201d``` and ```\u201cControl\"```. View the ```\u201ctrainingData/\u201d``` directory included in the repository as an example. This function calls the functions described below to generate training and validation files that cane be used as input for DeepCAT. AutoCAT parameters can be customized by setting values for ```userSize``` and ```userPurity```. ```userSize``` can be set to an integer value >0, and userPurity can be set to a floating point value >0 and \u22641. If omitted, the default ```userSize``` and ```userPurity``` values are 50 and 0.80, respectively.|\n|```getInputFiles(inputDIR)```| Outputs a concatenated text file named ```\u201ctrainingData.txt\u201d``` of all files in the input directory as well as a CSV files called ```labels.csv``` that labels each input file as cancer or non-cancer. The input diretory must follow the format described above.|\n|```runGIANA(inputFilename)```| Runs GIANA to produce a cluster file ```\u201ctrainingData--RotationEncodingBL62.txt\u201d``` using a 3.3 Smith-Waterman alignment score and 32 set as the number of threads. The input file should be a concatenated file produced by ```getInputFiles()```|\n|```getClusterComposition(clusterFilename, labelsFilename)```| Returns dictionaries ```clusterSizeDict``` and ```clusterPurityDict``` that store information about each cluster ID and the total number of sequences within a cluster and where the number of sequences derived from cancer patients, respectively. These dictionaries are later used to classify sequences and to generate the diagnostic purity plots. Requires the cluster file generated by GIANA and the CSV of labels generated by ```getInputFiles()``` as input.|\n|```separateClusters(clusterFilename, clusterPurityDict, clusterSizeDict, userSize=None, userPurity=None)```| Returns dictionaries of sequences classified as cancer or non-cancer separated into lengths from 12 to 17 as well as the total number of sequences available for training. Requires the cluster file generated by GIANA and the two dictionaries generated by ```getClusterComposition()```. Users can optionally customize ```userSize``` and ```userPurity```.|\n|```getTrainingandValidation(clusterFilename, labelsFilename, userSize=None, userPurity=None)```| Training and validation data files are generated and can be used as input for DeepCAT. AutoCAT creates a new directory called \u201cDeepCATInput\u201d which contains four output files for cancer and control training and validation sets. Non-cancer training data are used as true negative samples and cancer training data can be used as true positive samples. Sequences are randomly shuffled and split such that 80% of sequences for each length are reserved for training and 20% are withheld for validation. Requires the cluster file generated by GIANA and the CSV of labels generated by ```getInputFiles()```. Users can optionally customize ```userSize``` and ```userPurity.```|\n|```graphAvailableSeq(clusterFilename, labelsFilename)```| Produces a graph showing the number of available sequences for cluster purities 60% to 100% using cluster sizes ranging from 10 to 500 (graphAvailableSequences.png). |\n|```graphSamplePurity(clusterFilename, labelsFilename, userSize=None)```| Produces a line plot of the TCR classification error (graphTCRClassificationError.png), or the percent of healthy control TCRs classified as cancer as well as a bar plot displaying the percentage of sequences classified as cancer derived from cancer and non-cancer samples (graphPurityBarGraph) is also generated. If a cluster size is not provided, purity graphs are generated without using a cluster size threshold.|"
