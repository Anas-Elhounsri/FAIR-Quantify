The design and name of the software was inspired by\n[ParTIES](https://github.com/oarnaiz/ParTIES).\n\nThe required inputs are a ciliate MAC genome assembly, and a long read\nsequencing library (PacBio subreads or error-corrected CCS reads, or Nanopore\nreads) mapped onto that assembly. The mapper should report a valid CIGAR string\nand NM tag (for number of mismatches) per aligned read. The mapping is assumed\nto be accurate.\n\nRead more in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab613).\n\n"
