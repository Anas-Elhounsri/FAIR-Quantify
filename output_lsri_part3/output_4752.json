We work in cohorts, so it makes sense to try `ClinCNV` if you have more than 10 samples (recommended amount - 40 since we estimate variances from the data). By \"cohort\" we mean samples sequenced with the same enrichment kit with approximately the same depth (ie 1x WGS and 30x WGS better be analysed in separate runs of ClinCNV). Of course it is better if your samples were sequenced within the same sequencing facility. `ClinCNV` does not work with very small panels (tens of genes). \nCurrently we work with human genomes `hg19` and `hg38` only. **For `hg38` you need to turn on `--hg38` flag, by default it is hg19!** For mouse genome or any other diploid organism you have to replace *cytobands.txt* with the corresponding file. ClinCNV can work with small panels (hundreds of regions), but GC-correction can not be performed accurately for samples sequenced with such panels. \nNOTE: Folder `PCAWG` was used for CNVs detection in PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes cohort and is *research* only version. It is located here for historical reasons. Feel free to remove it. \n**bioRxiv** for somatic CNA analysis: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/837971v1 (calling of copy-number alterations in normal-tumor pairs). \nFor **common** CNPs: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35597955/ (this is an advanced analysis and the tool is not working strictly out of the box, better contact me first) \nThe reason for the very high computation time is, most probably, writing out the visualization tracks for IGV. You can turn it off via `--visulizationIGV` flag, if you are interested only in calls, not in the visual inspection.\n \n"

But if you have something intermediate, the criteria to choose the window size of off-target reads is: 1) not a lot of zero coverage regions (then the distributions will become zero-inflated and ClinCNV's results will be inaccurate), 2) approximate normality of coverage. To check the 2nd assumption, we recommend you to choose your desired window size, calculate coverage for ~30 samples, choose like 10-20 regions on random from the autosomes and built a density plot (`plot(density(coverages)`) in `R`). If you will see something that does not even remind you a bell shape, but has a large tail - you should increase the window size.\n \n"

Gene anotations in the last column can be used in output. \n`--colNum` - number of column in `.cov` file where coverage depth columns start. Normally equal to 4. \n`--scoreG` - germline CNV score threshold (loglikelihood difference). For additional information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Interpretation . As a guideline: 30 is usually a sensitive, but not specific option, 50 is balanced, 100 is quite strict and leads to high specificity, but (possibly) low sensitivity.  \n`--lengthG` - minimum length of germline CNV (number of markers = on- and off-target regions). Depends on your desired purposes. Recomended to keep up not smaller than 2. Due to historical reasons, actual number of data points will be bigger by one (e.g., if you put `--lengthG 0`, the actual number of datapoints will be 1). \n`--scoreS` - somatic score threshold. Since CNAs (copy-number changes in caner) are usually long and quite significant, but FFPE introduce huge noise into the tumor sequencing data, we do not recommend to keep it lower than 50. As a rule of thumb, we use threshold of 100 for panel of ~500 cancer genes and 200 for WES samples. \n`--lengthS` - minimum length of somatic CNA (# of markers, for WES it can be ~5-10 since CNAs are usually long). \n`--maxNumSomCNAs` - maximum number of allowed somatic CNAs. \n`--bafFolder` - folder with `.tsv` files containing information about B-allele frequencies in tumor and normal samples. Note: both tumor and normal sample have to be presented if you want to use it as a predictor. \n`--normalSample` - name of the sample (if only one germline sample is expected to be calculated). All the parameters are estimated for the whole cohort. Has to be presented in a header of the file with normal samples. Otherwise, the tool will fail with assert message. \n`--tumorSample` - name of the tumor sample (if only one sample is expected to be calculated). Has to be presented in 1) file pairs.txt in pair with the sample specified by --normalSample option, 2) in a header of the file with tumor samples. Otherwise, the tool will fail with assert message. \n"

We recommend you to use *ngs-bits* (https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits), however, as soon as your data match the format expected by ClinCNV you may proceed with any tool of choice (eg, *samtools*).\n\nYou should also have `.bed` file with the coordinates of targeted regions and reference genome in `.fasta` format for annotation of `.bed` file with *ngs-bits*.\n"

        "value": "ClinCNV now can work in 3 different contexts: germline calling, somatic calling (normal / tumor pairs) and trios. To run ClinCNV in germline context, you should minimally specify `--bed` and `--normal`. For trios, parameter `--triosFile` has to be specified (sample names for a child, his/hers mother and father, divided by comma). For somatic `--tumor` and `--pairs` has to be specified (pairs should contain tumor and normal sample names, divided by comma). It is highly recommended to use B-allele frequencies in somatic context. A folder with `.tsv` files has to be specified to switch to B-allele frequencies mode. Files need to have same sample names as column names in `--normal` and `--tumor` files. If ClinCNV does not find B-allele frequencies for a particular sample, it tries to detect CNVs using read depths only.\n\nTumor-only calling is under tests now. A flag `--onlyTumor` has to be specified. Better be used with `baf` files and off-target reads. 20 or more normal samples are recommended as a background. An example of tumor only running command (several tumors are already mixed with normals):\n\n`Rscript /path/to/clinCNV_test/ClinCNV/clinCNV.R  --normal /path/to/merged_normal_coverage.cov \n--normalOfftarget /path/to/merged_offtarget_coverage.cov --bed /path/to/ontarget_gc_annotated_bed.bed \n--bedOfftarget /path/to/offtarget_gc_annotated_bed.bed --onlyTumor --bafFolder /path/to/folder_with_baf_files --folderWithScript /path/to/clinCNV_test/ClinCNV \n--out /path/to/results --normalSample DX190627_01 --minimumPurity 30 --purityStep 5 --scoreS 150`\n"
