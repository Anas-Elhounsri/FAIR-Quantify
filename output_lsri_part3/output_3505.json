Create new ROIs, split existing ROIs, delete ROIs manually or based on properties like size, roundness and spectral power.\nVisualize and explore the fluorescence data in many ways.\n- Designed for and tested on a range of techniques and neuronal compartments \n(cell bodies, dendrites, axons, 1P, 2P, chronic glass windows, chronic GRIN lenses, cortical and subcortical brain regions)\n- To increase speed and decrease memory load fluorescence data is transposed and memory mapped.\n- Some scripts increase speed by using parallel processing.\n- The cross-spectral power images that result from the spectral analysis show excellent separation of active neural elements from the background. \nThe cross-spectral power has the advantage over correlation in the time domain of the fluorescence signal in that it has power over multiple different frequencies. \nDifferent frequencies contain different signal sources; noise can be visible in some frequencies, while neurons can be visible in others (see figure below).\n- Chronic tracking of ROIs over multiple sessions (imaged days to months apart).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Leveltlab/SpectralSegmentation/blob/master/docs/Figure_spectral-Delier_20190916_002-1-Declutter.png\">\nThis image shows results of the spectral analysis on two-photon calcium imaging in mouse V1.\nThe average- and maximum fluorescence can show fluorescence that is not related to activity of neurons. For example,\n higher baseline fluorescence of a neuron that is not clearly active (cyan box, with its signal shown on the right), or lower baseline \n fluorescence in blood vessels (green box). However, the cross-spectral power images shows different active neurons, depending on the frequency.\n The red box indicates a neuron that was not visible in the average- and maximum fluorescence projection, but it is clearly visible in some of the cross-spectral power images.\n Therefore, these cross-spectral power images are very useful for ROI selection.\n\n"
