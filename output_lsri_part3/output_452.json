        "value": "AIME Autoencoder-based Integrative Multi-omics data Embedding \nAIME extracts data representation for omics data integrative analysis. The method can adjust for confounder variables, achieve informative data embedding, rank features in terms of their contributions, and find pairs of features from the two data types that are related to each other through the data embedding.  \nThe method takes two matrices as inputs: the input matrix X_(N\u00d7p), and the output matrix Y_(Nxq). It also takes a confounder matrix (could be NULL if not necessary)  C_(N\u00d7s).\nWith regard to the sizes of the layers of the network, the method allows three different ways for the user to specify. (1) The user can directly specify the sizes of all the individual layers; (2) the user can input a shrinkage factor, such that the size of each layer in the encoder is the product of the size of the previous layer and the shrinkage factor, and the size of each decoder layer is the product of the next layer and the shrinkage factor; (3) the user can input the desired number of input/out layers, and the shrinkage factor is calculated based on the number of layers.  \nHere is a small example:\n```{r example}\nX<-matrix(rnorm(50000), ncol=50)\nY<-matrix(rnorm(70000), ncol=70)\nX2<-X\n\nfor(i in 1:20) \n{\n\trelat<-sample(1:3,1)\n\tif(relat==1) Y[,i]<-(X[,1]+X[,2]+X[,3]+X[,4])^2\n\tif(relat==2) Y[,i]<-sin((X[,1]+X[,2]+X[,3]+X[,4])*pi)\n\tif(relat==3) Y[,i]<-abs(X[,2]+X[,3]+X[,4])\n\tX2[,i]<-X[,ceiling(i/5)]+rnorm(nrow(X2))*0.5\n}\nX<-X2\nfor(i in 1:ncol(Y)) Y[,i]<- (Y[,i]-mean(Y[,i]))/sd(Y[,i])\n\nb<-aime(data.in=X, data.out=Y, layer.shrink.factor=4, max.dropout=0.25, max.epochs=100,importance.permutations=5, ncomp=3)\n\nplot(b$imp)\npairs(b$embeded)\n\n```\n \nWe include a utility to select some key parameters. At each hyperparameter setting, the data embedding (matrix E) is computed, and the average absolute pairwise correlation between the columns of the E matrix is calculated. Among the settings for which the average correlation is below a threshold, the Mardia\u2019s multivariate skewness and kurtosis coefficients are calculated for the embedded data. We rank each setting by the skewness and kurtosis of the embedded data, and then select the setting the yield the highest average rank of skewness and kurtosis. This process selects parameter settings that yield embedding that is not highly correlated, as well as with a distribution far from multivariate normal.  \nHere is a small example:\n```{r example}\n\ng<-aime.select(data.in=X[,-1:-5], data.out=Y, confounder=X[,1:10],all.in.layers=3:4, all.out.layers=3:4, all.dropouts=c(0.25, 0.5), repeats=2)\n\n```\nHere is the example output from the code. Smaller ranks in skewness and kurtosis indicate non-Gaussian distributions which AIME seeks. The last column is the average absolute correlation between the embeded dimensions. Smaller is better. \n```{r example}\n> g\n  in layers out layers dropout rank(rec.skew)/length(rec.skew) rank(rec.kurt)/length(rec.kurt)   rec.cor\n6         4          3     0.5                            0.75                           0.750 0.6794038\n7         3          4     0.5                            0.50                           0.875 0.6598576\n8         4          4     0.5                            1.00                           1.000 0.7493096\n\n```\n \nIn addition, a PDF file is written to the working directory, which contains the pairwise scatterplots. The user can visually examine the plots to select the hyperparameter settings. R binary files of the results in each parameter setting are also written in the folder. \n \n"
