        "value": "This analysis pipeline reconstructs T cell receptor (TCR) sequences that were enriched from 3' single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) libraries. The TCR is made up of the &alpha; and &beta; chains, which are expressed as *TRA* and *TRB* transcripts and contain variable regions that control T cell specificity. For the TCR enrichment from cDNA, a wetlab protocol is required such as TREK-seq (T cell Receptor Enrichment to linK clonotypes, [Miller 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01210-8), [DePasquale 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.809414/abstract)). We tested the protocol (TREK-seq) and pipeline (WAT3R) using 10x 3' v3 scRNA-seq cDNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as input to recover *TRA* and *TRB* transcripts and reconstruct variable regions. After demultiplexing the data generated by TREK-seq, WAT3R performs downstream analyses, including alignment, quality filters and generating a results table with cell barcodes and TCR assignments. WAT3R is described in [this _Bioinformatics_ paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-abstract/38/14/3645/6604269). \nPlease check out our [wiki pages](https://github.com/mainciburu/WAT3R/wiki) for a vignette, details about the output, and frequently asked questions. \n"
